Transformative AI (TAI) is defined as AI that precipitates a transition comparable to (or more significant than) the agricultural or industrial revolution. Label a paper as "TAI safety research" if: 
1. The contents of the paper are directly motivated by, and substantively inform, the challenge of ensuring good outcomes for TAI, 
2. There is substantive content on AI safety, not just AI capabilities, 
3. The intended audience is the community of researchers, 
4. It meets a subjective threshold of seriousness/quality, 
5. Peer review is not required.
Possible labels:
1. TAI safety research
2. not TAI safety research

Title: Two Alternatives to Logical Counterfactuals
Abstract Note: The following is a critique of the idea of logical counterfactuals. The idea of logical counterfactuals has appeared in previous agent foundations research (especially at MIRI): here, here. “…

Title: One Decade of Universal Artificial Intelligence
Abstract Note: The first decade of this century has seen the nascency of the first mathematical theory of general artificial intelligence. This theory of Universal Artificial Intelligence (UAI) has made significant contributions to many theoretical, philosophical, and practical AI questions. In a series of papers culminating in book (Hutter, 2005), an exciting sound and complete mathematical model for a super intelligent agent (AIXI) has been developed and rigorously analyzed. While nowadays most AI researchers avoid discussing intelligence, the award-winning PhD thesis (Legg, 2008) provided the philosophical embedding and investigated the UAI-based universal measure of rational intelligence, which is formal, objective and non-anthropocentric. Recently, effective approximations of AIXI have been derived and experimentally investigated in JAIR paper (Veness et al. 2011). This practical breakthrough has resulted in some impressive applications, finally muting earlier critique that UAI is only a theory. For the first time, without providing any domain knowledge, the same agent is able to self-adapt to a diverse range of interactive environments. For instance, AIXI is able to learn from scratch to play TicTacToe, Pacman, Kuhn Poker, and other games by trial and error, without even providing the rules of the games. These achievements give new hope that the grand goal of Artificial General Intelligence is not elusive. This article provides an informal overview of UAI in context. It attempts to gently introduce a very

Title: The Role and Limits of Principles in AI Ethics: Towards a Focus on Tensions
Abstract Note: The last few years have seen a proliferation of principles for AI ethics. There is substantial overlap between different sets of principles, with widespread agreement that AI should be used for the common good, should not be used to harm people or undermine their rights, and should respect widely held values such as fairness, privacy, and autonomy. While articulating and agreeing on principles is important, it is only a starting point. Drawing on comparisons with the field of bioethics, we highlight some of the limitations of principles: in particular, they are often too broad and high-level to guide ethics in practice. We suggest that an important next step for the field of AI ethics is to focus on exploring the tensions that inevitably arise as we try to implement principles in practice. By explicitly recognising these tensions we can begin to make decisions about how they should be resolved in specific cases, and develop frameworks and guidelines for AI ethics that are rigorous and practically relevant. We discuss some different specific ways that tensions arise in AI ethics, and what processes might be needed to resolve them.

Title: Advancing rational analysis to the algorithmic level
Abstract Note: Abstract             The commentaries raised questions about normativity, human rationality, cognitive architectures, cognitive constraints, and the scope or resource rational analysis (RRA). We respond to these questions and clarify that RRA is a methodological advance that extends the scope of rational modeling to understanding cognitive processes, why they differ between people, why they change over time, and how they could be improved.

Title: Computer Simulations as a Technological Singularity in the Empirical Sciences
Abstract Note: SummaryIn this paper, I discuss the conditions necessary for computer simulations to qualify as a technological singularity in the empirical sciences. A technological singularity encompasses two claims: (a) the enhancement of human cognitive capacities by the computer, and (b) their displacement from the center of the production of knowledge. For computer simulations to be a technological singularity, then, they must fulfill points (a) and (b) above. Although point (a) is relatively unproblematic, point (b) needs further analysis. In particular, in order to show that humans could be displaced from the center of the production of knowledge, it is necessary to establish the reliability of computer simulations. That is, I need to show that computer simulations are reliable processes that render, most of the time, valid results. To be a reliable process, in turn, means that simulations accurately represent the target system and carry out error-free computations. I analyze verification and validation methods as the grounds for such representation accuracy and error-free computations. Since the aim is to entrench computer simulations as a technological singularity, the entire analysis must be careful to keep human agents out of the picture.
