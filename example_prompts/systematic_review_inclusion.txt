Identify whether this paper should be included in a meta-review which includes the findings of systematic reviews on interventions designed to promote charitable donations. 
Included reviews should describe monetary charitable donations, assess any population of participants in any context, and be peer reviewed and written in English. 
They should not report new data, be non-systematic reviews, consider cause-related marketing or other kinds of prosocial behaviour.

Title: Imagine being a nice guy: A note on hypothetical vs. Incentivized social preferences
Abstract: We conducted an experimental study on social preferences using dictator games similar to Fehr et al. (2008). Our results show that social preferences differ between subjects who receive low-stakes monetary rewards for their decisions and subjects who consider hypothetical stakes. Our findings indicate that, apart from incentives, gender plays an important role for the categorization of different social preferences. © 2015. The authors license.

Title: Consumer reaction to price increase: An investigation in gasoline industry
Abstract: Purpose – The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of increase in price of an essential product (i.e. gasoline) toward the focal product and other seemingly non-related products. Design/methodology/approach – A self-administered survey was used to collect data from the drivers at a large metroplex in Southwest USA. Multiple regression and scanning electron microscope procedures were used to analyze and test the proposed hypotheses. Findings – When consumers notice the increase in gas prices, they become very anxious. This anxiety is positively associated with average gas bought in gallons and negatively associated with threshold price. Further, this consumer anxiety has the strongest influence on lifestyle changes, followed by automobile technology change and transportation mode change, and has the weakest influence on gasoline brand/type change. Research limitations/implications – We focus on only anxiety as a mediator between increase in gas prices and the behavioral outcomes, and collect data from only one location. Practical implications – Managers must be cognizant that a price increase in essential goods not only influences the demand for focal products but also for products that may not seem related to the focal products. Social implications – Increase in gasoline price will not only affect the demand for gasoline, but also the demand for alternate forms of transportation, fuel efficient vehicles, and other aspects of life. Originality/value – This study is the first to look at the role of anxiety as a mediator and looks at the effects of increase in gas prices in a holistic manner. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Title: Being sticker rich: Numerical context influences children's sharing behavior
Abstract: Young children spontaneously share resources with anonymous recipients, but little is known about the specific circumstances that promote or hinder these prosocial tendencies. Children (ages 3-11) received a small (12) or large (30) number of stickers, and were then given the opportunity to share their windfall with either one or multiple anonymous recipients (Dictator Game). Whether a child chose to share or not varied as a function of age, but was uninfluenced by numerical context. Moreover, children's giving was consistent with a proportion- based account, such that children typically donated a similar proportion (but different absolute number) of the resources given to them, regardless of whether they originally received a small or large windfall. The proportion of resources donated, however, did vary based on the number of recipients with whom they were allowed to share, such that on average, children shared more when there were more recipients available, particularly when they had more resources, suggesting they take others into consideration when making prosocial decisions. Finally, results indicated that a child's gender also predicted sharing behavior, with males generally sharing more resources than females. Together, findings suggest that the numerical contexts under which children are asked to share, as well as the quantity of resources that they have to share, may interact to promote (or hinder) altruistic behaviors throughout childhood. © 2015 Posid et al.

Title: Public charity offer as a proximate factor of evolved reputation-building strategy: an experimental analysis of a real-life situation
Abstract: Although theoretical considerations suggest that a considerable portion of human altruism is driven by concerns about reputation, few experimental studies have examined the psychological correlates of individual decisions in real-life situations. Here we demonstrate that more subjects were willing to give assistance to unfamiliar people in need if they could make their charity offers in the presence of their group mates than in a situation where the offers remained concealed from others. In return, those who were willing to participate in a particular charitable activity received significantly higher scores than others on scales measuring sympathy and trustworthiness. Finally, a multiple regression analysis revealed that while several personality and behavior traits (cooperative ability, Machiavellianism, sensitivity to norms, and sex) play a role in the development of prosocial behavior, the possibility of gaining reputation within the group remains a measurable determinant of charitable behavior. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Title: Assessing actual strategic behavior to construct a measure of strategic ability
Abstract: Strategic interactions have been studied extensively in the area of judgment and decision-making. However, so far no specific measure of a decision-maker's ability to be successful in strategic interactions has been proposed and tested. Our contribution is the development of a measure of strategic ability that borrows from both game theory and psychology. Such measure is aimed at providing an estimation of the likelihood of success in many social activities that involve strategic interaction among multiple decision-makers. To construct a reliable measure of strategic ability, that we propose to call "Strategic Quotient" (SQ), we designed a test where each item is a game and where, therefore, the individual obtained score depends on the distribution of choices of other decision-makers taking the test. The test is designed to provide information on the abilities related to two dimensions, mentalization and rationality, that we argue are crucial to strategic success, with each dimension being characterized by two main factors. Principal component analysis on preliminary data shows that indeed four factors (two for rationality, two for mentalization) account for strategic success in most of the strategically simpler games of the test. Moreover, two more strategically sophisticated games are inserted in the test and are used to investigate if and to what extent the four factors obtained by simpler games can predict strategic success in more sophisticated strategic interactions. Overall, the collected empirical evidence points to the possibility of building a SQ measure using only simple games designed to capture information about the four identified factors. © 2019 Bilancini, Boncinelli and Mattiassi.

Title: How construals of money versus time impact consumer charitable giving
Abstract: While past research has suggested that consumers have fundamentally different responses to thinking about money versus time, the current work clarifies an important nuance in terms of how consumers construe these two resources. We demonstrate that, in the domain of charitable giving, money is construed relatively more concretely, whereas time is construed relatively more abstractly. This difference in the construal of these two resources has implications for how appeals for charitable contributions or money versus time should be framed. When the construal level at which the consumer considers the cause is aligned (misaligned) with the construal level of the resource being requested, contribution intentions and behaviors increase (decrease). In addition, the moderating role of resource abundance is examined. In particular, when money is considered abundant (vs. nonabundant), consumers no longer exhibit more concrete thoughts in response to money compared to time. Finally, when the donation request makes consumers think of money in a more abundant manner, monetary donations can be successfully motivated with a more abstract call for charitable support. The theoretical and practical implications for marketers and charitable organizations are discussed. © The Author 2015.
