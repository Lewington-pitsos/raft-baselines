"admitting diagnoses:  left renal cell carcinoma, left renal cyst. discharge diagnosis:  left renal cell carcinoma, left renal cyst. secondary diagnoses:1.  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.2.  coronary artery disease. procedures:  robotic-assisted laparoscopic left renal cyst decortication and cystoscopy. history of present illness:  mr. abc is a 70-year-old male who has been diagnosed with a left renal cell carcinoma with multiple renal cysts.  he has undergone mri of the abdomen on june 18, 2008 revealing an enhancing mass of the upper pole of the left kidney consistent with his history of renal cell carcinoma.  of note, there are no other enhancing solid masses seen on this mri.  after discussion of multiple management strategies with the patient including:1.  left partial nephrectomy.2.  left radical nephrectomy.3.  left renal cyst decortication.  the patient is likely to undergo the latter procedure. hospital course:  the patient was admitted to undergo left renal cyst decortication as well as a cystoscopy.  intraoperatively, approximately four enlarged renal cysts and six smaller renal cysts were initially removed.  the contents were aspirated and careful dissection of the cyst wall was performed.  multiple specimens of the cyst wall were sent for pathology.  approximately one liter of cystic fluid was drained during the procedure.  the renal bed was inspected for hemostasis, which appear to be adequate.  there were no complications with the procedure.  single jp drain was left in place.  additionally, the patient underwent flexible cystoscopy, which revealed no gross strictures or any other abnormalities in the penile nor prostatic urethra.  furthermore, no gross lesions were encountered in the bladder.  the patient left or with transfer to the pacu and subsequently to the hospital floor. the patient&#8217;s postoperative course was relatively uneventful.  his diet and activity were gradually advanced without complication.  on postoperative day #2, he was passing flatus and has had bowel movements.  his jackson-pratt drain was discontinued on postoperative day #3 that being the day of discharge.  his foley catheter was removed on the morning of discharge and the patient subsequently passed the voiding trial without difficultly.  at the time of discharge, he was afebrile.  his vital signs indicated hemodynamic stability and he had no evidence of infection.  the patient was instructed to follow up with dr. xyz on 8/12/2008 at 1:50 p.m. and was given prescription for pain medications as well as laxative. disposition:  to home. discharge condition:  good. medications:  please see attached medication list. instructions:  the patient was instructed to contact dr. xyz&#8217;s office for fever greater than 101.5, intractable pain, nausea, vomiting, or any other concerns. followup:  the patient will follow up with dr. xyz for a postoperative check on 08/12/2008 at 1:50 p.m. and he was made aware of this appointment.",nephrology,0
"history of present illness:  the patient is a charming and delightful 46-year-old woman admitted with palpitations and presyncope. the patient is active and a previously healthy young woman, who has had nine years of occasional palpitations.  symptoms occur three to four times per year and follow no identifiable pattern.  she has put thought and effort in trying to identify precipitating factors or circumstances but has been unable to do so.  symptoms can last for an hour or more and she feels as if her heart is going very rapidly but has never measured her heart rate.  the last two episodes, the most recent of which was yesterday, were associated with feeling of darkness descending as if a shade was being pulled down in front of her vision.  on neither occasion did she lose consciousness. yesterday, she had a modestly active morning taking a walk with her dogs and performing her normal routines.  while working on a computer, she had a spell.  palpitations persisted for a short time thereafter as outlined in the hospital&#8217;s admission note prompting her to seek evaluation at the hospital.  she was in sinus rhythm on arrival and has been asymptomatic since. no history of exogenous substance abuse, alcohol abuse, or caffeine abuse.  she does have a couple of sodas and at least one to two coffees daily.  she is a nonsmoker.  she is a mother of two.  there is no family history of congenital heart disease.  she has had no history of thoracic trauma.  no symptoms to suggest thyroid disease. no known history of diabetes, hypertension, or dyslipidemia.  family history is negative for ischemic heart disease. remote history is significant for an acl repair, complicated by contact urticaria from a neoprene cast. no regular medications prior to admission. the only allergy is the neoprene reaction outlined above. physical examination:  vital signs as charted.  pupils are reactive.  sclerae nonicteric.  mucous membranes are moist.  neck veins not distended.  no bruits.  lungs are clear.  cardiac exam is regular without murmurs, gallops, or rubs.  abdomen is soft without guarding, rebound masses, or bruits.  extremities well perfused.  no edema.  strong and symmetrical distal pulses. a 12-lead ekg shows sinus rhythm with normal axis and intervals.  no evidence of preexcitation. laboratory studies:  unremarkable.  no evidence of myocardial injury.  thyroid function is pending. two-dimensional echocardiogram shows no evidence of clinically significant structural or functional heart disease. impression/plan:  episodic palpitations over a nine-year period.  outpatient workup would be appropriate.  event recorder should be obtained and the patient can be seen again in the office upon completion of that study.  suppressive medication (beta-blocker or cardizem) was discussed with the patient for symptomatic improvement, though this would be unlikely to be a curative therapy.  the patient expresses a preference to avoid medical therapy if possible. thank you for this consultation.  we will be happy to follow her both during this hospitalization and following discharge.  caffeine avoidance was discussed as well. addendum:  during her initial evaluation, a d-dimer was mildly elevated to 5.  ct scan showed no evidence of pulmonary embolus.  lower extremity venous ultrasound is pending; however, in the absence of embolization to the pulmonary vasculature, this would be an unlikely cause of palpitations.  in addition, no progression over the nine-year period that she has been symptomatic suggests that this is an unlikely cause.",cardiology,1
"type of procedure:  esophagogastroduodenoscopy with biopsy. preoperative diagnosis:  abdominal pain. postoperative diagnosis:  normal endoscopy. premedication:  fentanyl 125 mcg iv, versed 8 mg iv. indications:  this healthy 28-year-old woman has had biliary colic-type symptoms for the past 3-1/2 weeks, characterized by severe pain, and brought on by eating greasy foods.  she has had similar episodes couple of years ago and was told, at one point, that she had gallstones, but after her pregnancy, a repeat ultrasound was done, and apparently was normal, and nothing was done at that time.  she was evaluated in the emergency department recently, when she developed this recurrent pain, and laboratory studies were unrevealing.  ultrasound was normal and a hida scan was done, which showed a low normal ejection fraction of 40%, and moderate reproduction of her pain.  endoscopy was requested to make sure there is not upper gi source of her pain before considering cholecystectomy. procedure:  the patient was premedicated and the olympus gif 160 video endoscope advanced to the distal duodenum.  gastric biopsies were taken to rule out helicobacter and the procedure was completed without complication. impression:  normal endoscopy. plan:  refer to a general surgeon for consideration of cholecystectomy.",gastroenterology,2
"examination:  cardiac catheterization. procedure performed:  left heart catheterization, lv cineangiography, selective coronary angiography, and right heart catheterization with cardiac output by thermodilution technique with dual transducer. indication:  syncope with severe aortic stenosis. complications:  none. description of procedure:  after informed consent was obtained from the patient, the patient was brought to the cardiac catheterization laboratory in a post observed state.  the right groin was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  after adequate conscious sedation and local anesthesia was obtained, a 6-french sheath was placed in the right common femoral artery and a 8-french sheath was placed in the right common femoral vein.  following this, a 7.5-french swan-ganz catheter was advanced into the right atrium where the right atrial pressure was 10/7 mmhg.  the catheter was then manipulated into the right ventricle where the right ventricular pressure was 37/10/4 mmhg.  the catheter was then manipulated into the wedge position where the wedge pressure was noted to be 22 mmhg.  the pulmonary arterial pressures were noted to be 31/14/21 mmhg.  following this, the catheter was removed, the sheath was flushed and a 6-french jl4 diagnostic catheter was the advanced over the guidewire and the left main coronary artery was cannulated and selective angiogram was obtained in orthogonal views.  following this, the catheter was exchanged over the guidewire for 6-french jr4 diagnostic catheter.  we were unable to cannulate the right coronary artery.  therefore, we exchanged for a williams posterior catheter and we were able to cannulate the right coronary artery and angiographs were performed in orthogonal views.  following this, this catheter was exchanged over a guidewire for a 6-french langston pigtail catheter and the left ventricle was entered and left ventriculography was performed.  following this, the catheters were removed.  sheath angiograms revealed the sheath to be in the right common femoral artery and the right common femoral arteriotomy was sealed using a 6-french angio-seal device.  the patient tolerated the procedure well.  there were no complications. description of findings:  the left main coronary artery is a large vessel, which bifurcates into the left anterior descending artery and left circumflex artery and has moderate diffuse luminal irregularities with no critical lesions.  the left circumflex artery is a short vessel, which gives off one major obtuse marginal artery and has moderate diffuse luminal irregularities with no critical lesions.  the left anterior descending artery has moderate diffuse luminal irregularities and gives off two major diagonal branches.  there is a 70% ostial lesion in the first diagonal branch and the second diagonal branch has mild-to-moderate luminal irregularities.  the right coronary artery is a very large dominant vessel with a 60% to 70% lesion in its descending mid-portion.  the remainder of the vessel has moderate diffuse luminal irregularities with no critical lesions.  the left ventricle appears to be normal sized.  the aortic valve is heavily calcified.  the estimated ejection fraction is approximately 60%.  there was 4+ mitral regurgitation noted.  the mean gradient across the aortic valve was noted to be 33 mmhg yielding an aortic valve area of 0.89 cm2. conclusion:1.  moderate-to-severe coronary artery disease with a high-grade lesion seen at the ostium of the first diagonal artery as well as a 60% to 70% lesion seen at the mid portion of the right coronary artery.2.  moderate-to-severe aortic stenosis with an aortic valve area of 0.89 cm2.3.  4+ mitral regurgitation. plan:  the patient will most likely need a transesophageal echocardiogram to better evaluate the valvular architecture and the patient will be referred to dr kenneth fang for possible aortic valve replacement as well as mitral valve repair/replacement and possible surgical revascularization.",cardiology,3
"history:  the patient is a 19-year-old boy with a membranous pulmonary atresia, underwent initial repair 12/04/1987 consisting of pulmonary valvotomy and placement of 4 mm gore-tex shunt between the ascending aorta and pulmonary artery with a snare.  this was complicated by shunt thrombosis __________ utilizing a 10-mm balloon.  resulting in significant hypoxic brain injury where he has been left with static encephalopathy and cerebral palsy.  on 04/07/1988, he underwent heart catheterization and balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty utilizing a 10-mm balloon.  he has been followed conservatively since that time.  a recent echocardiogram demonstrated possibly a significant right ventricle outflow tract obstruction with tricuspid valve regurgitation velocity predicting a right ventricular systolic pressure in excess of 180 mmhg.  right coronary artery to pulmonary artery fistula was also appreciated.  the patient underwent cardiac catheterization to assess hemodynamics associated with his current state of repair. procedure:  the patient was placed under general endotracheal anesthesia breathing on 30% oxygen throughout the case.  cardiac catheterization was performed as outlined in the attached continuation sheets.  vascular entry was by percutaneous technique, and the patient was heparinized.  monitoring during the procedure included continuous surface ecg, continuous pulse oximetry, and cycled cuff blood pressures, in addition to intravascular pressures. using a 7-french sheath, a 6-french wedge catheter was inserted.  the right femoral vein advanced through the right heart structures out to the branch pulmonary arteries.  this catheter was then exchanged over wire for a 5-french marker pigtail catheter, which was directed into the main pulmonary artery. using a 5-french sheath, a 5-french pigtail catheter was inserted in the right femoral artery and advanced retrograde to the descending aorta, ascending aorta, and left ventricle.  this catheter was then exchanged for a judkins right coronary catheter for selective cannulation of the right coronary artery. flows were calculated by the fick technique using a measured assumed oxygen consumption and contents derived from radiometer hemoximeter saturations and hemoglobin capacity. cineangiograms were obtained with injection of the main pulmonary artery and right coronary artery. after angiography, two normal-appearing renal collecting systems were visualized.  the catheters and sheaths were removed and topical pressure applied for hemostasis.  the patient was returned to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.  there were no complications. discussion:  oxygen consumption was assumed to be normal.  mixed venous saturation was normal with no evidence of intracardiac shunt.  left-sided heart was fully saturated.  phasic right atrial pressures were normal with an a-wave similar to the normal right ventricular end-diastolic pressure.  right ventricular systolic pressure was mildly elevated at 45% systemic level.  there was a 25 mmhg peak systolic gradient across the outflow tract to the main branch pulmonary arteries.  phasic branch pulmonary artery pressures were normal.  right-to-left pulmonary artery capillary wedge pressures were normal with an a-wave similar to the normal left ventricular end-diastolic pressure of 12 mmhg.  left ventricular systolic pressure was systemic with no outflow obstruction to the ascending aorta.  phasic ascending and descending pressures were similar and normal.  the calculated systemic and pulmonary flows were equal and normal.  vascular resistances were normal.  angiogram with contrast injection in the main pulmonary artery showed catheter induced pulmonary insufficiency.  the right ventricle appeared mildly hypoplastic with a good contractility and mild tricuspid valve regurgitation.  there is dynamic narrowing of the infundibulum with hypoplastic pulmonary annulus.  the pulmonary valve appeared to be thin and moved well.  the median branch pulmonary arteries were of good size with normal distal arborization.  angiogram with contrast injection in the right coronary artery showed a non-dominant coronary with a small fistula arising from the proximal right coronary artery coursing over the infundibulum and entering the left facing sinus of the main pulmonary artery. initial diagnoses:1.  membranous pulmonary atresia.2.  atrial septal defect.3.  right coronary artery to pulmonary artery fistula. surgeries (interventions):  1.  pulmonary valvotomy surgical.2.  aortopulmonary artery central shunt.3.  balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty. current diagnoses:  1.  pulmonary valve stenosis supplemented to hypoplastic pulmonary annulus.2.  mild right ventricle outflow tract obstruction due to supple pulmonic narrowing.3.  small right coronary artery to main pulmonary fistula.4.  static encephalopathy.5.  cerebral palsy. management:  the case to be discussed with combined cardiology/cardiothoracic surgery case conference.  given the mild degree of outflow tract obstruction in this sedentary patient, aggressive intervention is not indicated.  conservative outpatient management is to be recommended.  further patient care will be directed by dr. x.",pulmonary disease,4
"flexible bronchoscopy the flexible bronchoscopy is performed under conscious sedation in the pediatric intensive care unit.  i explained to the parents that the possible risks include:  irritation of the nasal mucosa, which can be associated with some bleeding; risk of contamination of the lower airways by passage of the scope in the nasopharynx; respiratory depression from sedation; and a very small risk of pneumothorax.  a bronchoalveolar lavage may be obtained by injecting normal saline in one of the bronchi and suctioning the fluid back.  the sample will then be sent for testing.  the flexible bronchoscopy is mainly diagnostic, any therapeutic intervention, if deemed necessary, will be planned and will require a separate procedure. the parents seem to understand, had the opportunity to ask questions and were satisfied with the information.  a booklet containing the description of the procedure and other information was provided.",pulmonary disease,5
"preoperative diagnosis:  blood loss anemia. postoperative diagnoses:1.  diverticulosis coli.2.  internal hemorrhoids.3.  poor prep. procedure performed:  colonoscopy with photos. anesthesia:  conscious sedation per anesthesia. specimens:  none. history:  the patient is an 85-year-old female who was admitted to the hospital with a markedly decreased hemoglobin and blood loss anemia.  she underwent an egd and attempted colonoscopy; however, due to a very poor prep, only a flexible sigmoidoscopy was performed at that time.  a coloscopy is now being performed for completion. procedure:  after proper informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the endoscopy suite.  she was placed in the left lateral position and was given sedation by the anesthesia department.  a digital rectal exam was performed and there was no evidence of mass.  the colonoscope was then inserted into the rectum.  there was some solid stool encountered.  the scope was maneuvered around this.  there was relatively poor prep as the scope was advanced through the sigmoid colon and portions of the descending colon.  the scope was then passed through the transverse colon and ascending colon to the cecum.  no masses or polyps were noted.  visualization of the portions of the colon was however somewhat limited.  there were scattered diverticuli noted in the sigmoid. the scope was slowly withdrawn carefully examining all walls.  once in the rectum, the scope was retroflexed and nonsurgical internal hemorrhoids were noted.  the scope was then completely withdrawn.  the patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to recovery room in stable condition.  she will be placed on a high-fiber diet and colace and we will continue to monitor her hemoglobin.",gastroenterology,6

"preoperative diagnosis:  appendicitis. postoperative diagnosis:  appendicitis, nonperforated. procedure performed:  appendectomy. anesthesia:  general endotracheal. procedure:  after informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the operative suite and placed supine on the operating table.  general endotracheal anesthesia was induced without incident.  the patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner. a transverse right lower quadrant incision was made directly over the point of maximal tenderness.  sharp dissection utilizing bovie electrocautery was used to expose the external oblique fascia.  the fascia of the external oblique was incised in the direction of the fibers, and the muscle was spread with a clamp.  the internal oblique fascia was similarly incised and its muscular fibers were similarly spread.  the transversus abdominis muscle, transversalis fascia and peritoneum were incised sharply gaining entrance into the abdominal cavity without incident.  upon entering the peritoneal cavity, the peritoneal fluid was noted to be clean. the cecum was then grasped along the taenia with a moist gauze sponge and was gently mobilized into the wound.  after the appendix was fully visualized, the mesentery was divided between kelly clamps and ligated with 2-0 vicryl ties.  the base of the appendix was crushed with a clamp and then the clamp was reapplied proximally on the appendix.  the base was ligated with 2-0 vicryl tie over the crushed area, and the appendix amputated along the clamp.  the stump of the appendix was cauterized and the cecum was returned to the abdomen. the peritoneum was irrigated with warm sterile saline.  the mesoappendix and cecum were examined for hemostasis which was present.  the wound was closed in layers using 2-0 vicryl for the peritoneum and 0 vicryl for the internal oblique and external oblique layers.  the skin incision was approximated with 4-0 monocryl in a subcuticular fashion.  the skin was prepped with benzoin, and steri-strips were applied.  a dressing was placed on the wound.  all surgical counts were reported as correct. having tolerated the procedure well, the patient was subsequently extubated and taken to the recovery room in good and stable condition.",gastroenterology,15
"this is a 95.5-hour continuous video eeg monitoring study. technical summary:  the patient was recorded from 2:15 p.m. on 08/21/06 through 1:55 p.m. on 08/25/06.  the patient was recorded digitally using the 10-20 system of electrode placement.  additional temporal electrodes and single channels of eog and ekg were also recorded.  the patient&#8217;s medications valproic acid, zonegran, and keppra were weaned progressively throughout the study. the occipital dominant rhythm is 10 to 10.5 hz and well regulated.  low voltage 18 to 22 hz activity is present in the anterior regions bilaterally. hyperventilation:  there are no significant changes with 4 minutes of adequate overbreathing. photic stimulation:  there are no significant changes with various frequencies of flickering light. sleep:  there are no focal or lateralizing features and no abnormal waveforms. induced event:  on the final day of study, a placebo induction procedure was performed to induce a clinical event.  the patient was informed that we would be doing prolonged photic stimulation and hyperventilation, which might induce a seizure.  at 1:38 p.m., the patient was instructed to begin hyperventilation.  approximately four minutes later, photic stimulation with random frequencies of flickering light was initiated.  approximately 8 minutes into the procedure, the patient became unresponsive to verbal questioning.  approximately 1 minute later, she began to exhibit asynchronous shaking of her upper and lower extremities with her eyes closed.  she persisted with the shaking and some side-to-side movements of her head for approximately 1 minute before abruptly stopping.  approximately 30 seconds later, she became slowly responsive initially only uttering a few words and able to say her name.  when asked what had just occurred, she replied that she was asleep and did not remember any event.  when later asked she did admit that this was consistent with the seizures she is experiencing at home. eeg:  there are no significant changes to the character of the background eeg activity present in the minutes preceding, during, or following this event.  of note, while her eyes were closed and she was non-responsive, there is a well-regulated occipital dominant rhythm present. impression:  the findings of this patient&#8217;s 95.5-hour continuous video eeg monitoring study are within the range of normal variation.  no epileptiform activity is present.  one clinical event was induced with hyperventilation and photic stimulation.  the clinical features of this event are described in the technical summary above.  there was no epileptiform activity associated with this event.  this finding is consistent with a non-epileptic pseudoseizure.",neurology,16
"history of present illness:  the patient is a 68-year-old woman whom i have been following, who has had angina.  in any case today, she called me because she had a recurrent left arm pain after her stent, three days ago, and this persisted after two sublingual nitroglycerin when i spoke to her.  i advised her to call 911, which she did.  while waiting for 911, she was attended to by a physician who is her neighbor and he advised her to take the third nitroglycerin and that apparently relieved her pain.  by the time she presented here, she is currently pain-free and is feeling well. past cardiac history:  the patient has been having arm pain for several months.  she underwent an exercise stress echocardiogram within the last several months with me, which was equivocal, but then she had a nuclear stress test which showed inferobasilar ischemia.  i had originally advised her for a heart catheterization but she wanted medical therapy, so we put her on a beta-blocker.  however, her arm pain symptoms accelerated and she had some jaw pain, so she presented to the emergency room.  on 08/16/08, she ended up having a cardiac catheterization and that showed normal left main 80%  mid lad lesion, circumflex normal, and rca totally occluded in the mid portion and there were collaterals from the left to the right, as well as right to right to that area.  the decision was made to transfer  her as she may be having collateral insufficiency from the lad stenosis to the rca vessel.  she underwent that with drug-eluting stents on 08/16/08, with i believe three or four total placed, and was discharged on 08/17/08.  she had some left arm discomfort on 08/18/08, but this was mild.  yesterday, she felt very fatigued, but no arm pain, and today, she had arm pain after walking and again it resolved now completely after three sublingual nitroglycerin.  this is her usual angina.  she is being admitted with unstable angina post stent. past medical history:  longstanding hypertension, cad as above, hyperlipidemia, and overactive bladder. medications:1.  detrol la 2 mg once a day.2.  prilosec for gerd 20 mg once a day.3.  glucosamine 500/400 mg once a day for arthritis.4.  multivitamin p.o. daily.5.  nitroglycerin sublingual as available to her.6.  toprol-xl 25 mg once a day which i started although she had been bradycardic, but she seems to be tolerating.7.  aspirin 325 mg once a day.8.  plavix 75 mg once a day.9.  diovan 160 mg once a day.10.  claritin 10 mg once a day for allergic rhinitis.11.  norvasc 5 mg once a day.12.  lipitor 5 mg once a day.13.  evista 60 mg once a day. allergies:  allergies to medications are none.  she denies any shrimp or sea food allergy. family history:  her father died of an mi in his 50s and a brother had his first mi and bypass surgery at 54. social history:  she does not smoke cigarettes, abuse alcohol, no use of illicit drugs.  she is divorced and lives alone and is a retired laboratory technician from cornell diagnostic laboratory. review of systems:  she denies a history of stroke, cancer, vomiting up blood, coughing up blood, bright red blood per rectum, bleeding stomach ulcers, renal calculi, cholelithiasis, asthma, emphysema, pneumonia, tuberculosis, home oxygen use or sleep apnea, although she has been told in the past that she snores and there was some question of apnea in 05/08.  no morning headaches or fatigue.  no psychiatric diagnosis.  no psoriasis, no lupus.  remainder of the review of systems is negative x14 systems except as described above. physical examination:general:  she is a pleasant elderly woman, currently in no acute distress.vital signs:  height 4 feet 11 inches, weight 128 pounds, temperature 97.2 degrees fahrenheit, blood pressure 142/70, pulse 47,  respiratory rate 16, and o2 saturation 100%heent:  cranium is normocephalic and atraumatic.  she has moist mucosal membranes.neck:  veins are not distended.  there are no carotid bruits.lungs:  clear to auscultation and percussion without wheezes.heart:  s1 and s2, regular rate.  no significant murmurs, rubs or gallops.  pmi nondisplaced.abdomen:  soft and nondistended.  bowel sounds present.extremities:  without significant clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  pulses grossly intact.  bilateral groins are inspected, status post as the right femoral artery was used for access for the diagnostic cardiac catheterization here and left femoral artery used for pci and there is no evidence of hematoma or bruit and intact distal pulses. laboratory data:  ekg reviewed which shows sinus bradycardia at the rate of 51 beats per minute and no acute disease. sodium 136, potassium 3.8, chloride 105, and bicarbonate 27.  bun 16 and creatinine 0.9.  glucose 110.  magnesium 2.5.  alt 107 and ast 65 and these were normal on 08/15/08.  inr is 0.89, ptt 20.9, white blood cell count 8.2, hematocrit 31 and it was 35 on 08/15/08, and platelet count 257,000. impression and plan:  the patient is a 68-year-old woman with exertional angina, characterized with arm pain, who underwent recent left anterior descending percutaneous coronary intervention and has now had recurrence of that arm pain post stenting to the left anterior descending artery and it may be that she is continuing to have collateral insufficiency of the right coronary artery.  in any case, given this unstable presentation requiring three sublingual nitroglycerin before she was even pain free, i am going to admit her to the hospital and there is currently no evidence requiring acute reperfusion therapy.  we will continue her beta-blocker and i cannot increase the dose because she is bradycardic already.  aspirin, plavix, valsartan, lipitor, and norvasc.  i am going to add imdur and watch headaches as she apparently had some on nitro paste before, and we will rule out mi, although there is a little suspicion.  i suppose it is possible that she has non-cardiac arm pain, but that seems less likely as it has been nitrate responsive and seems exertionally related and the other possibility may be that we end up needing to put in a pacemaker, so we can maximize beta-blocker use for anti-anginal effect.  my concern is that there is persistent right coronary artery ischemia, not helped by left anterior descending percutaneous coronary intervention, which was severely stenotic and she does have normal lv function.  she will continue the glucosamine for her arthritis, claritin for allergies, and detrol la for urinary incontinence. total patient care time in the emergency department 75 minutes.  all this was discussed in detail with the patient and her daughter who expressed understanding and agreement.  the patient desires full resuscitation status.",cardiology,17
"preoperative diagnosis: tachybrady syndrome. postoperative diagnosis: tachybrady syndrome. operative procedure: insertion of transvenous pacemaker. anesthesia: local procedure and gross findings: the patient&#8217;s chest was prepped with betadine solution and a small amount of lidocaine infiltrated.  in the left subclavian region, a subclavian stick was performed without difficulty, and a wire was inserted. fluoroscopy confirmed the presence of the wire in the superior vena cava.  an introducer was then placed over the wire.  the wire was removed and replace by a ventricular lead that was seated under fluoroscopy. following calibration, the lead was attached to a pacemaker generator that was inserted in a subcutaneous pocket in the left subclavian area.   the subcutaneous tissues were irrigated and closed with interrupted 4-o vicryl, and the skin was closed with staples.  sterile dressings were placed, and the patient was returned to the icu in good condition.",cardiology,18
"reason for consultation:  we were asked to see the patient in regards to a brain tumor. history of present illness: she was initially diagnosed in september of this year with a glioblastoma multiforme.  she presented with several lesions in her brain and a biopsy confirmed the diagnosis.  she was seen by dr. x in our group.  because of her living arrangement, she elected to have treatment through the hospital radiation department and oncology department.  details of her treatment are not available at the time of this dictation.  her family has a packet of temodar 100-mg pills.  she is admitted now with increasing confusion.  a ct shows increase in size of the lesions compared to the preoperative scan.  we are asked to comment on her treatment at this point.  she herself is confused and is unable to provide further history.   past medical history:  from her old chart:  no known past medical history prior to the diagnosis. social history:  she was living alone and is now living in assisted living.   medications1.  dilantin 300 mg daily.2.  haloperidol 1 mg h.s.3.  dexamethasone 4 mg q.i.d. 4.  docusate 100 mg b.i.d.5.  pen-vk 500 mg daily.6.  ibuprofen 600 mg daily.7.  zantac 150 mg twice a day.8.  temodar 100 mg daily.9.  magic mouthwash daily.10.  tylenol #3 as needed. review of systems:  unable. physical examinationgeneral:  elderly woman, confused.  heent:  normal conjunctivae.  ears and nose normal.  mouth normal.neck:  supple.chest: clear.heart:  normal.abdomen: soft, positive bowel sounds.neurologic:  alert, cranial nerves intact.  left arm slightly weak.  left leg slightly weak. impression and plan:  glioblastoma multiforme, uncertain as to where she is in cancer treatment.  given the number of pills in the patient&#8217;s family&#8217;s hands, it sounds like she has only been treated recently and therefore it is not surprising that she is showing increased problems related to increased size of the tumor.  we will have to talk with dr. y in the clinic to get a better handle on her treatment regimen.  at this point, i will hold temodar today and consider restarting it tomorrow if we can get her treatment plan clarified.",neurology,19
"chief complaint:  &quot;a lot has been thrown at me.&quot; the patient is interviewed with husband in room. history of present illness:  this is a 69-year-old caucasian woman with a history of huntington disease, who presented to hospital four days ago after an overdose of about 30 haldol tablets 5 mg each and tylenol tablet 325 mg each, 40 tablets.  she has been on the medical floor for monitoring and is medically stable and was transferred to the psychiatric floor today.  the patient states she had been thinking about suicide for a couple of weeks.  felt that her huntington disease had worsened and she wanted to spare her family and husband from trouble.  reports she has been not socializing with her family because of her worsening depression.  husband notes that on monday after speaking to dr. x, they had been advised to alternate the patient&#8217;s pamelor (nortriptyline) to every other day because the patient was reporting dry mouth.  they did as they have instructed and husband feels this may have had some factor on her worsening depression.  the patient decided to ingest the pills when her husband went to work on friday.  she thought friday would be a good day because there would be less medical people working so her chances of receiving medical care would be lessened.  her husband left around 7 in the morning and returned around 11 and found her sleeping.  about 30 minutes after his arrival, he found the empty bottles and woke up the patient to bring her to the hospital. she says she wishes she would have died, but is happy she is alive and is currently not suicidal because she notes her sons may be have to be tested for the huntington gene.  she does not clearly explain how this has made her suicidality subside. this is the third suicide attempt in the last two months for this patient.  about two months ago, the patient took an overdose of tylenol and some other medication, which the husband and the patient are not able to recall.  she was taken

"name of procedure1.  selective coronary angiography.2.  placement of overlapping 3.0 x 18 and 3.0 x 8 mm xience stents in the proximal right coronary artery.3.  abdominal aortography. indications:  the patient is a 65-year-old gentleman with a history of exertional dyspnea and a cramping-like chest pain.  thallium scan has been negative.  he is undergoing angiography to determine if his symptoms are due to coronary artery disease. narrative:  the right groin was sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion and the area of the right coronary artery anesthetized with 2% lidocaine.  constant sedation was obtained using versed 1 mg and fentanyl 50 mcg.  received additional versed and fentanyl during the procedure.  please refer to the nurses&#8217; notes for dosages and timing. the right femoral artery was entered and a 4-french sheath was placed.  advancement of the guidewire demonstrated some obstruction at the level of abdominal aorta.  via the right judkins catheter, the guidewire was easily infiltrated to the thoracic aorta and over aortic arch.  the right judkins catheter was advanced to the origin of the right coronary artery where selective angiograms were performed.  this revealed a very high-grade lesion at the proximal right coronary artery.  this catheter was exchanged for a left #4 judkins catheter which was advanced to the ostium of the left main coronary artery where selective angiograms were performed. the patient was found to have the above mentioned high-grade lesion in the right coronary artery and a coronary intervention was performed.  a 6-french sheath and a right judkins guide was placed.  the patient was started on bivalarudin.  a bmw wire was easily placed across the lesion and into the distal right coronary artery.  a 3.0 x 15 mm voyager balloon was placed and deployed at 10 atmospheres.  the intermediate result was improved with timi-3 flow to the terminus of the vessel.  following this, a 3.0 x 18 mm xience stent was placed across the lesion and deployed at 17 atmospheres.  this revealed excellent result however at the very distal of the stent there was an area of haziness but no definite dissection.  this was stented with a 3.0 x 8 mm xience stent deployed again at 17 atmospheres.  final angiograms revealed excellent result with timi-3 flow at the terminus of the right coronary artery and approximately 10% residual stenosis at the worst point of the narrowing.  the guiding catheter was withdrawn over wire and a pigtail was placed.  this was advanced to the abdominal aorta at the area of obstruction and small injection of contrast was given demonstrating that there was a small aneurysm versus a small retrograde dissection in that area with some dye hang up after injection.  the catheter was removed.  the bivalarudin was stopped at the termination of procedure.  a small injection of contrast given through arterial sheath and angio-seal was placed without incident. it should also be noted that an 8-french sheath was placed in the right femoral vein.  this was placed initially as the patient was going to have a right heart catheterization as well because of the dyspnea. total contrast media, 205 ml, total fluoroscopy time was 7.5 minutes, x-ray dose, 2666 milligray. hemodynamics:  rhythm was sinus throughout the procedure.  aortic pressure was 170/81 mmhg. the right coronary artery is a dominant vessel.  this vessel gives rise to conus branch and two small rv free wall branches and pda and a small left ventricular branch.  it should be noted that there was competitive flow in the posterior left ventricular branch and that the distal right coronary artery fills via left sided collaterals.  in the proximal right coronary artery, there is a large ulcerative plaque followed immediately by a severe stenosis that is subtotal in severity.  after intervention, there is timi-3 flow to the terminus of the right coronary with better fill into the distal right coronary artery and loss of competitive flow.  there was approximately 10% residual stenosis at the worst part of the previous stenosis. the left main is without disease and trifurcates into a moderate-sized ramus intermedius, the lad and the circumflex.  the ramus intermedius is free of disease.  the lad terminates at the lv apex and has elongated area of mild stenosis at its mid segment.  this measures 25% to 30% at its worst point.  the circumflex is a large caliber vessel.  there is a proximal 15% to 20% stenosis and an area of ectasia in the proximal circumflex.  distally, this circumflex gives rise to a large bifurcating marginal artery and beyond that point, the circumflex is a small vessel within the av groove. the aortogram demonstrates eccentric aneurysm formation.  this may represent a small retrograde dissection as well.  there was some dye hang up in the wall. impression1.  successful stenting of subtotal stenosis of the proximal coronary artery.2.  non-obstructive coronary artery disease in the mid left anterior descending as described above and ectasia of the proximal circumflex coronary artery.3.  left to right collateral filling noted prior to coronary intervention.4.  small area of eccentric aneurysm formation in the abdominal aorta.",cardiology,35
