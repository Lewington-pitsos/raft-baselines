Prototyping and transforming facial textures for perception research,Wavelet based methods for prototyping facial textures for artificially transforming the age of facial images were described. Prototype images were used to define the salient features of a particular face classification. Two experiments were conducted to validate the ability of wavelet processing method to capture age information. The first experiment validated the textured prototyping method while the second experiment investigated the effectiveness of the new age transformation technique. The shape and color transformation used to rejuvenate faces hardly affected the apparent age. The average hair color change during rejuvenation was not sufficient to project the hair color in normal range for the younger age group.,"Tiddeman, B.; Burt, M.; Perrett, D.",IEEE Comput Graphics Appl,not included,0
School finance reform and voluntary fiscal federalism,"California has transferred the financing of its public schools from localities to the state. In response, many families have supplemented the tax revenue of their local public schools with voluntary contributions. This paper analyzes that phenomenon. We propose a model of partial cooperation among parents in making voluntary contributions to their public schools. Under reasonable conditions, the model predicts that contributions per pupil should decline with school size. We estimate this relationship using data on contributions to California schools. Our estimates reveal that contributions per pupil do decline with size; however, the rate of decline is surprisingly slow. © 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","Brunner, E.; Sonstelie, J.",J.

"Intra-organizational volunteerism: Good soldiers, good deeds and good politics","Despite the millions of hours donated to charity each year by employees on behalf of their employers there has been relatively little research into the motives for such pro-social behavior. The current paper extends Peterson's (2004, Journal of Business Ethics 49, 371) study by exploring a unique form of employee volunteerism identified as intra-organizational, or employer-sanctioned volunteerism, and uniting the heretofore distinct charity support and organizational citizenship behavior literatures. Results of a preliminary study revealed that employee participation in such intra-organizational volunteer programs is motivated by charity, firm, and personal benefits.

Implicit vs. Explicit deception in ultimatum games with incomplete information,"We explore bargaining, using ultimatum games, when one party, the proposer, possesses private information about the pie size and can either misrepresent this information through untruthful statements (explicit deception) or through information-revealing actions (implicit deception). Our study is the first such direct comparison between two ways in which people can deceive. We find that requiring informed parties to make an explicit statement yields greater deception than when information is communicated implicitly, particularly for larger stakes. However, allowing the explicit statement to be accompanied by a promise of truthfulness reverses this effect. In contrast with many previous studies, we generally observe very high frequencies of dishonesty. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Kriss, P.H.; Nagel, R.; Weber, R.A.",J. Econ. Behav. Organ.,not included,4
"Why people choose teaching: A scoping review of empirical studies, 2007–2016","Who enters teaching and why are questions of immense social and political importance throughout the world. This paper presents a scoping review of empirical studies, published between 2007 and 2016, that addressed influences on the choice of teaching as a career. Seventy articles were analysed descriptively and substantively. Our overview of the nature, extent, and range of research published in these articles highlights that most studies focus on motivations for teaching, with intrinsic and altruistic motivations most commonly identified. We argue that a broader range of theoretical perspectives could add fresh insights to the question of why people choose teaching.

Being sticker rich: Numerical context influences children's sharing behavior,"Young children spontaneously share resources with anonymous recipients, but little is known about the specific circumstances that promote or hinder these prosocial tendencies. Children (ages 3-11) received a small (12) or large (30) number of stickers, and were then given the opportunity to share their windfall with either one or multiple anonymous recipients (Dictator Game). Whether a child chose to share or not varied as a function of age, but was uninfluenced by numerical context. Moreover, children's giving was consistent with a proportion- based account, such that children typically donated a similar proportion (but different absolute number) of the resources given to them, regardless of whether they originally received a small or large windfall. The proportion of resources donated, however, did vary based on the number of recipients with whom they were allowed to share, such that on average, children shared more when there were more recipients available, particularly when they had more resources, suggesting they take others into consideration when making prosocial decisions. Finally, results indicated that a child's gender also predicted sharing behavior, with males generally sharing more resources than females. Together, findings suggest that the numerical contexts under which children are asked to share, as well as the quantity of resources that they have to share, may interact to promote (or hinder) altruistic behaviors throughout childhood. © 2015 Posid et al.

Advancing Measurement and Research on Youths’ Prosocial Behavior in the Digital Age,"Widespread access to digital and social media has drastically altered the nature of youth’s interpersonal connections. In this context, the opportunities children and adolescents have to help people around them are rapidly evolving. In this article, we review emerging literature on how digital media influences youth’s prosocial development in new ways. Then we propose the next steps for advancing the field’s understanding of youth’s prosocial behavior in the digital age. We advocate for extending existing measures to capture experiences that are increasingly relevant for children and adolescents today, with a focus on current events, including the COVID-19 pandemic, and social and political activism. We also provide a research agenda to advance the understanding of prosocial development. © 2021 The Authors Child Development Perspectives © 2021 The Society for Research in Child Development","Armstrong-Carter, E.; Telzer, E.H.",Child Dev.

Gossip as an alternative for direct observation in games of indirect reciprocity,"Communication about social topics is abundant in human societies, and many functions have been attributed to such gossiping. One of these proposed functions is the management of reputations. Reputation by itself has been shown to have a strong influence on cooperation dynamics in games of indirect reciprocity, and this notion helps to explain the observed high level of cooperation in humans. Here we designed a game to test a widespread assumption that gossip functions as a vector for the transmission of social information. This empirical study (with 14 groups of nine students each) focuses on the composition of gossip, information transfer by gossip, and the behavior based on gossip information. We show that gossip has a strong influence on the resulting behavior even when participants have access to the original information (i.e., direct observation) as well as gossip about the same information. Thus, it is evident that gossip has a strong manipulative potential. Furthermore, gossip about cooperative individuals is more positive than gossip about uncooperative individuals, gossip comments transmit social information successfully, and cooperation levels are higher when people encounter positive compared with negative gossip. © 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.","Sommerfeld, R.D.; Krambeck, H.-J.; Semmann, D.; Milinski, M.",Proc.

Time to loss of brain function and activity during circulatory arrest,"PURPOSE: Brain function during the dying process and around the time of cardiac arrest is poorly understood. To better inform the clinical physiology of the dying process and organ donation practices, we performed a scoping review of the literature to assess time to loss of brain function and activity after circulatory arrest. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline and Embase databases were searched from inception to June 2014 for articles reporting the time interval to loss of brain function or activity after loss of systemic circulation. RESULTS: Thirty-nine studies met selection criteria. Seven human studies and 10 animal studies reported that electroencephalography (EEG) activity is lost less than 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest. In the setting of existing brain injury, with progressive loss of oxygenated circulation, loss of EEG may occur before circulatory arrest. Cortical evoked potentials may persist for several minutes after loss of circulation. CONCLUSION: The time required to lose brain function varied according to clinical context and method by which this function is measured. Most studies show that clinical loss of consciousness and loss of EEG activity occur within 30seconds after abrupt circulatory arrest and may occur before circulatory arrest after progressive hypoxia-ischemia. Prospective clinical studies are required to confirm these observations.","Pana, R; Hornby, L; Shemie, S D; Dhanani, S; Teitelbaum, J",J. Crit. Care,not included,12
Stability of hemoglobin mass over 100 days in active men,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the suggestion in a recent meta-analysis that variability in hemoglobin mass increases when time between measurements increases from days to months. Hemoglobin mass of six active men was measured with the carbon monoxide method every 1-6 days for 100-114 days (42 +/- 3 measurements, mean +/- SD). Measurement error for each individual's series was estimated from the standard deviation of consecutive pairwise changes and compared with his total error (standard deviation of all values). Linear trends and periodicities in each series were quantified by regression and spectral analysis. Series with known random error and periodicity were also simulated and analyzed. There were clear differences in the pairwise error of measurement between subjects (range 1.4-2.7%). For five men, there was little difference between the total and pairwise errors; their mean ratio (1.06, 90% confidence limits 0.96-1.17) was less than ratios for simulated sinusoidal series with random error of 2%, amplitude of 2%, and periods of 20-100 days (ratios 1.13-1.21). Spectral analysis clearly revealed such periodicities in the simulated series but not in the series of these subjects. The sixth man, who had donated blood 12 days before commencing measurements, showed errors, trend, and periodicity consistent with gradual restoration of hemoglobin mass. Measurement error of hemoglobin mass does not increase over 100 days. Consequently, hemoglobin mass may be suitable for long-term monitoring of small changes that might occur with training or erythropoietin abuse, taking into consideration the small differences between athletes in errors and trends.","Eastwood, Annette; Hopkins, Will G; Bourdon, Pitre C; Withers, Robert T; Gore, Christopher J",J.

"A meta-analysis of prosocial media on prosocial behavior, aggression, and empathic concern: A multidimensional approach","Studies examining the effects of exposure to prosocial media on positive outcomes are increasing in number and strength. However, existing meta-analyses use a broad definition of prosocial media that does not recognize the multidimensionality of prosocial behavior. The aim of the current study is to conduct a meta-analysis on the effects of exposure to prosocial media on prosocial behavior, aggression, and empathic concern while examining multiple moderators that the prosocial behavior literature suggests are important to our understanding of why individuals voluntarily help others (e.g., target, type, cost). Results from 72 studies involving 243 effect sizes revealed that exposure to prosocial media was related to higher levels of prosocial behavior and empathic concern and lower levels of aggressive behavior. Moderation analyses suggest that several moderators accounted for heterogeneity in the model, including age of participant, region, media type (active vs. passive), and study design. In terms of multidimensional moderators, prosocial media had stronger effects on prosocial behavior toward strangers than did any other target and on helping and prosocial thinking but not donating or volunteering. Comparisons with other meta-analyses on media effects are made and implications for parents, media producers, and researchers are discussed.

Treatment strategies for osteoarthritis patients with pain and hypertension,"Out of 100 patients with osteoarthritis (OA), almost 40 have a concomitant diagnosis of hypertension. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors may trigger a rise in blood pressure (BP), which is more marked in patients with established hypertension. NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors attenuate the antihypertensive effect of several antihypertensive agents. Frequent BP controls are needed in treated hypertensive patients who are concomitantly receiving NSAIDs or COX-2 inhibitors because even a small increase in BP may be associated with an important rise in the risk of major cardiovascular complications. In meta-analyses, an increase in systolic BP of 5mmHg was associated with a 25% higher risk of cardiovascular events. These data have been confirmed in randomized studies with rofecoxib and celecoxib, where a modest increase in BP was associated with a significantly higher risk of cardiovascular disease. There is emerging evidence that the COX-inhibiting nitric oxide donator (CINOD) class is promising in the treatment of patients with OA. Naproxcinod, the first CINOD investigated in clinical trials, is composed of the traditional NSAID naproxen covalently bound to the nitric oxide (NO)-donating moiety butanediol mono-nitrate (BDMN). The molecule has the potential to provide a sustained release of NO. In clinical studies, naproxcinod prevented the BP rise in normotensive and hypertensive patients observed with naproxen. The BP benefit of naproxcinod over naproxen was greater in patients concomitantly receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers. These investigational data suggest that naproxcinod is a valuable alternative to NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors for treatment of OA patients.","Verdecchia, Paolo; Angeli, Fabio; Mazzotta, Giovanni; Martire, Paola; Garofoli, Marta; Gentile, Giorgio; Reboldi, Gianpaolo",Ther.

"Nonprofit organizations, monopolistic competition, and private donations: Evidence from Spain","This article presents an analysis of the determinants of money and time donations to Spanish nongovernmental organizations that channel aid to less developed countries. A basic model inspired by the theory of monopolistic competition is formulated and tested taking into account that some of the explanatory variables, such as fund-raising expenditure and price, are endogenous. The results show that the average donor is different for money and time donations and that government preferences differ from those of private donors. Finally, the authors find that the hypothesis of efficient fund-raising expenditures cannot be rejected.","Marcuello, C.; Salas, V.",Public Financ. Rev.,not included,17
Public goods provision and redistributive taxation,"This paper studies the relationship between redistributive taxation and tax-deductible charitable contributions. Redistribution has two opposite effects on voluntary giving. The price of charitable giving decreases with the degree of redistribution, and this has a positive effect on the total amount of giving (substitution effect). However, redistribution leads to lower consumption for the contributors and therefore has a negative effect on contributions to the charity (income effect). The theoretical model developed in this paper demonstrates that, under a general class of utility functions, the substitution effect dominates the income effect. Hence, charitable giving increases with the tax rate. In purely egalitarian societies, the public good is provided efficiently and the total welfare is maximized independent of the ex-ante income inequality. However, the positive impact of taxation on charitable giving and welfare may disappear if individuals generate their income levels in anticipation of taxation and redistribution does not take into account the cost of effort. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

"Responsibility, norms, and helping in an emergency","Replicated the J. Darley and B. Latane (see record) study of bystander aid to a seizure victim examining the effects of (a) number and competence of bystanders, (b) information appropriate for action, and (c) ascription of responsibility (AR) upon helping by males and females. From an analysis of norms relevant in an emergency and of the likelihood of their activation, main effects on speed of helping for the above 4 variables, interactions of the 1st 3 with AR, a Sex of Subject × Number interaction, and differences in type of help offered in various conditions were predicted. 179 undergraduates participated in a factorial experiment. Speed of helping dropped significantly for females, but not for males, when other bystanders were present (reporting decreased, direct help was unaffected), and dropped significantly further when another bystander was medically competent (reporting increased, direct help decreased). Among females disposed to accept rationales for denying responsibility, both effects were particularly strong. Information-action and AR to the self were associated with faster and more direct help. Data on Ss' thoughts and feelings reinforced a normative interpretation of the results.

Emerging adulthood: A theory of development from the late teens through the twenties,"Emerging adulthood is proposed as a new conception of development for the period from the late teens through the twenties, with a focus on ages 18-25. A theoretical background is presented. Then evidence is provided to support the idea that emerging adulthood is a distinct period demographically, subjectively, and in terms of identity explorations. How emerging adulthood differs from adolescence and young adulthood is explained. Finally, a cultural context for the idea of emerging adulthood is outlined, and it is specified that emerging adulthood exists only in cultures that allow young people a prolonged period of independent role exploration during the late teens and twenties.","Arnett, J.J.",Am.

Assessing actual strategic behavior to construct a measure of strategic ability,"Strategic interactions have been studied extensively in the area of judgment and decision-making. However, so far no specific measure of a decision-maker's ability to be successful in strategic interactions has been proposed and tested. Our contribution is the development of a measure of strategic ability that borrows from both game theory and psychology. Such measure is aimed at providing an estimation of the likelihood of success in many social activities that involve strategic interaction among multiple decision-makers. To construct a reliable measure of strategic ability, that we propose to call ""Strategic Quotient"" (SQ), we designed a test where each item is a game and where, therefore, the individual obtained score depends on the distribution of choices of other decision-makers taking the test. The test is designed to provide information on the abilities related to two dimensions, mentalization and rationality, that we argue are crucial to strategic success, with each dimension being characterized by two main factors. Principal component analysis on preliminary data shows that indeed four factors (two for rationality, two for mentalization) account for strategic success in most of the strategically simpler games of the test. Moreover, two more strategically sophisticated games are inserted in the test and are used to investigate if and to what extent the four factors obtained by simpler games can predict strategic success in more sophisticated strategic interactions. Overall, the collected empirical evidence points to the possibility of building a SQ measure using only simple games designed to capture information about the four identified factors. © 2019 Bilancini, Boncinelli and Mattiassi.","Bilancini, E.; Boncinelli, L.; Mattiassi, A.",Front.

Impact of presumed consent for organ donation on donation rates: a systematic review,"OBJECTIVES: To examine the impact of a system of presumed consent for organ donation on donation rates and to review data on attitudes towards presumed consent. DESIGN: Systematic review. DATA SOURCES: Studies retrieved by online searches to January 2008 of Medline, Medline In-Process, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, HMIC, PAIS International, and OpenSIGLE. Studies reviewed Five studies comparing donation rates before and after the introduction of legislation for presumed consent (before and after studies); eight studies comparing donation rates in countries with and without presumed consent systems (between country comparisons); 13 surveys of public and professional attitudes to presumed consent. RESULTS: The five before and after studies represented three countries: all reported an increase in donation rates after the introduction of presumed consent, but there was little investigation of any other changes taking place concurrently with the change in legislation. In the four best quality between country comparisons, presumed consent law or practice was associated with increased organ donation-increases of 25-30%, 21-26%, 2.7 more donors per million population, and 6.14 more donors per million population in the four studies. Other factors found to be important in at least one study were mortality from road traffic accidents and cerebrovascular causes, transplant capacity, gross domestic product per capita, health expenditure per capita, religion (Catholicism), education, public access to information, and a common law legal system. Eight surveys of attitudes to presumed consent were of the UK public. These surveys varied in the level of support for presumed consent, with surveys conducted before 2000 reporting the lowest levels of support (28-57%). The most recent survey, in 2007, reported that 64% of respondents supported a change to presumed consent. CONCLUSION: Presumed consent alone is unlikely to explain the variation in organ donation rates between countries. Legislation, availability of donors, organisation and infrastructure of the transplantation service, wealth and investment in health care, and public attitudes to and awareness of organ donation may all play a part, but their relative importance is unclear. Recent UK surveys show support for presumed consent, though with variation in results that may reflect differences in survey methods.","Rithalia, Amber; McDaid, Catriona; Suekarran, Sara; Myers, Lindsey; Sowden, Amanda",BMJ,not included,22
Social learning theory,"Three forms of social learning theory relevant to child development are reviewed. The first (see Robert Sears) involved attempts to combine Freudian and stimulus-response learning theory. Explaining the internalization of parent expectations, however, was a challenge for this approach. In a second form, Albert Bandura employed learning principles of reinforcement and punishment but also argued that the primary form of learning was observation. Additionally, he emphasized the role of cognition in learning. A third form, associated with Gerald Patterson among others, focuses on behavior management of difficult children and continues to underlie many forms of intervention practiced today. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Social dilemma cooperation (unlike Dictator Game giving) is intuitive for men as well as women,"Does intuition favor prosociality, or does prosocial behavior require deliberative self-control? The Social Heuristics Hypothesis (SHH) stipulates that intuition favors typically advantageous behavior - but which behavior is typically advantageous depends on both the individual and the context. For example, non-zero-sum cooperation (e.g. in social dilemmas like the Prisoner's Dilemma) typically pays off because of the opportunity for reciprocity. Conversely, reciprocity does not promote zero-sum cash transfers (e.g. in the Dictator Game, DG). Instead, DG giving can be long-run advantageous because of reputation concerns: social norms often require such behavior of women but not men. Thus, the SHH predicts that intuition will favor social dilemma cooperation regardless of gender, but only favor DG giving among women. Here I present meta-analytic evidence in support of this prediction. In 31 studies examining social dilemma cooperation (N=13,447), I find that promoting intuition increases cooperation to a similar extent for both men and women. This stands in contrast to the results from 22 DG studies (analyzed in Rand et al., 2016) where intuition promotes giving among women but not men. Furthermore, I show using meta-regression that the interaction between gender and intuition is significantly larger in the DG compared to the cooperation games. Thus, I find clear evidence that the role of intuition and deliberation varies across both setting and individual as predicted by the SHH.","Rand, David G",J. Exp. Soc. Psychol.,not included,24
Public charity offer as a proximate factor of evolved reputation-building strategy: an experimental analysis of a real-life situation,"Although theoretical considerations suggest that a considerable portion of human altruism is driven by concerns about reputation, few experimental studies have examined the psychological correlates of individual decisions in real-life situations. Here we demonstrate that more subjects were willing to give assistance to unfamiliar people in need if they could make their charity offers in the presence of their group mates than in a situation where the offers remained concealed from others. In return, those who were willing to participate in a particular charitable activity received significantly higher scores than others on scales measuring sympathy and trustworthiness. Finally, a multiple regression analysis revealed that while several personality and behavior traits (cooperative ability, Machiavellianism, sensitivity to norms, and sex) play a role in the development of prosocial behavior, the possibility of gaining reputation within the group remains a measurable determinant of charitable behavior. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

A comparison of two behavioral influence techniques for improving blood donor recruitment,"This study was designed to test the viability of two multiple request techniques of behavioral influence for recruiting blood donors by telephone. The first technique utilizes a small antecedent request to encourage behavioral involvement and favorable disposition toward the target activity of the critical request to donate. The second approach frames the critical request as a concession following refusal of a very large request. The two techniques, dubbed the foot‐in‐the‐door (FID) and door‐in‐the‐face (DIF), respectively, were tested against a control condition on three donor groups: active donors, inactive donors, and nondonors. Thus, a three‐by‐three factorial design was used on 910 adults in a Midwest city. Although the DIF was outperformed by the control across all three donor groups, the authors recommend its continued study in face‐to‐face donor solicitation. Importantly, the FID approach produced more donations than the control condition among active donors (Z = 4.30; p < .001), inactives (Z = 7.45; p < .001), and nondonors (Z = 1.98; p < .05). For managing the blood supply, the FID is particularly potent for rekindling donations from inactive donors. Additional research on means of penetrating the nondonor segment is recommended. 1984 AABB","Dwyer, F.R.; Greenwalt, T.J.; Coe, N.A.",Transfusion,not included,26
Adult‐related haematopoietic stem cell donor experiences and the provision of information and psychosocial support: A systematic literature review,"For blood cancer patients, haematopoietic stem cells (HSC) donated by a relative can be lifesaving. However, related donors can face significant physical and psychosocial challenges. As the demand for adult‐related HSC donors is increasing, it is important to review our understanding of adult‐related HSC donors’ need for and availability of information and psychosocial support with a view to identifying gaps in the literature. A systematic review of relevant studies (2000–2017) was conducted using five databases with supplementary hand searching. Sixteen studies involving 1,024 related HSC donors met the following criteria: English or Dutch language, peer‐reviewed, sampled first‐time‐related HSC donors, ≥ 18 years, haematological malignancies, assessed psychosocial aspects, retrospective or prospective and with or without comparison group. Data were abstracted, and study quality was assessed using the PRISMA criteria. Studies contained limited information on the provision of information and psychosocial support. Most studies addressed pre‐donation information, and none reported providing information or support to donors post‐donation. Additionally, few studies formally assessed unmet needs. Recommendations include improved transparency of reporting for the availability, sources and timing of information and psychosocial support, and the identification of unmet needs to enable the development of educational and psychosocial interventions for this invaluable donor population.patients, haematopoietic stem cells (HSC) donated by a relative can be lifesaving.

Effects of sexual dimorphism on facial attractiveness,"Testosterone-dependent secondary sexual characteristics in males may signal immunological competence and are sexually selected for in several species. In humans, oestrogen-dependent characteristics of the female body correlate with health and reproductive fitness and are found attractive. Enhancing the sexual dimorphism of human faces should raise attractiveness by enhancing sex-hormone-related cues to youth and fertility in females, and to dominance and immunocompetence in males. Here we report the results of asking subjects to choose the most attractive faces from continua that enhanced or diminished differences between the average shape of female and male faces. As predicted, subjects preferred feminized to average shapes of a female face. This preference applied across UK and Japanese populations but was stronger for within-population judgements, which indicates that attractiveness cues are learned. Subjects preferred feminized to average or masculinized shapes of a male face. Enhancing masculine facial characteristics increased both perceived dominance and negative attributions (for example, coldness or dishonesty) relevant to relationships and paternal investment. These results indicate a selection pressure that limits sexual dimorphism and encourages neoteny in humans.","Perrett, D.I.; Lee, K.J.; Penton-Voak, I.; Rowland, D.; Yoshikawa, S.; Burt, D.M.; Henzi, S.P.; Castles, D.L.; Akamatsu, S.",Nature,not included,31

Does government funding suppress nonprofits' political activity?,"Autonomy from the state has been considered a core feature of American civil society, and understanding the consequences of perceived threats to that autonomy has been a central theme in social and political theory. We engage this theme by examining a specific question: What is the effect of government funding on nonprofit organizations' political activity? Extant theory and research identify some mechanisms by which government funding might reduce nonprofit political activity and other mechanisms by which government funding might enhance such activity. We investigate this relationship with two data sets: a national sample of religious congregations and a longitudinal sample of nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Results across these data sets are consistent and compelling: The relationship between government funding and nonprofit political activity is either positive or null; government funding does not suppress nonprofit political activity.","Chaves, M.; Stephens, L.; Galaskiewicz, J.",Am.

Governing the Hollow State,"For the past ten years the authors have conducted a concentrated research program on the dimensions and impact of the hollow state. The hollow state is a metaphor for the increasing use of third parties, often nonprofits, to deliver social services and generally act in the name of the state. The types of structures, incentives, and mechanisms used to control third-party providers have been the focus of this research. The empirical thrust of this research is on how effective various types of mechanisms, structures, and incentives are at promoting the effectiveness of contracted services. The normative question this research has raised, but not answered, is, What effect does government contracting with third-party providers have on the perceived legitimacy of the state? This article is a summary of the theoretical development and the empirical findings from the authors' research on the dimensions and impact of the hollow state in the domain of health and human services contracting. Elements of this article have appeared previously in this journal and in many others as well. The article's purpose is to integrate the authors' research on the hollow state. This is a summative article that seeks to bring together in one place what the authors have learned. In addition, new directions are explored for future research on the hollow state.","Milward, H.B.; Provan, K.G.",J. Public Adm. Res. Theory,not included,34
The Role of Food Banks in Addressing Food Insecurity: A Systematic Review,"Food banks play a major role in the food aid sector by distributing donated and purchased groceries directly to food insecure families. The public health implications of food insecurity are significant, particularly as food insecurity has a higher prevalence among certain population groups. This review consolidates current knowledge about the function and efficacy of food banks to address food insecurity. A systematic review was conducted. Thirty-five publications were reviewed, of which 14 examined food security status, 13 analysed nutritional quality of food provided, and 24 considered clients' needs in relation to food bank use. This review found that while food banks have an important role to play in providing immediate solutions to severe food deprivation, they are limited in their capacity to improve overall food security outcomes due to the limited provision of nutrient-dense foods in insufficient amounts, especially from dairy, vegetables and fruits.

Operating characteristics of a rank correlation test for publication bias,"An adjusted rank correlation test is proposed as a technique for identifying publication bias in a meta-analysis, and its operating characteristics are evaluated via simulations. The test statistic is a direct statistical analogue of the popular 'funnel-graph.' The number of component studies in the meta-analysis, the nature of the selection mechanism, the range of variances of the effect size estimates, and the true underlying effect size are all observed to be influential in determining the power of the test. The test is fairly powerful for large meta-analyses with 75 component studies, but has only moderate power for meta-analyses with 25 component studies. However, in many of the configurations in which there is low power, there is also relatively little bias in the summary effect size estimate. Nonetheless, the test must be interpreted with caution in small meta-analyses. In particular, bias cannot be ruled out if the test is not significant. The proposed technique has potential utility as an exploratory tool for meta-analysts, as a formal procedure to complement the funnel- graph.","Begg, C.B.; Mazumdar, M.",BIOMETRICS,not included,38

The Effects of Monetary Incentives and Labeling on the Foot-in-the-Door Effect: Evidence for a Self-Perception Process,"We tested the self-perception explanation of the foot-in-the-door effect by manipulating self-perceived helpfulness and assessing self-concept. Participants given $1 to sign a homelessness petition were less likely to see themselves as altruistic than participants not given the monetary incentive. The paid participants also complied less often with a request to work on a canned food drive 2 days later than unpaid participants. In contrast, participants told they were helpful individuals were more likely to see themselves as altruistic and were more likely to volunteer for the food drive than unlabeled participants. Mediation analyses provide evidence that changes in self-concept underlie a successful foot-in-the-door manipulation and support the self-perception explanation for the foot-in-the-door effect.","Burger, Jerry M; Caldwell, David F",Basic Appl.

A comparison of clinical officers with medical doctors on outcomes of caesarean section in the developing world: meta-analysis of controlled studies,"The authors tentatively concluded that there was no statistically significant difference in maternal or perinatal mortality in caesarean sections carried out by clinical officers compared with doctors, but wound dehiscence and wound infection were significantly more frequent in caesarean sections carried out by clinical officers. XCM: The review question was clear and supported by potentially reproducible inclusion criteria. The search strategy appeared to include a number of relevant sources and was not restricted by language, which reduced the possibility of language bias. It did not appear that specific searches were undertaken for unpublished studies, so some potentially relevant data may have been missed. Study selection was conducted in duplicate, but it was unclear whether similar methods to reduce error and bias were used for quality assessment and data extraction.Study quality was assessed using an appropriate tool and results were reported. Adequate details of primary studies were provided. Combining the results in meta-analyses may not have been appropriate given the variability of the studies and the statistical (and clinical) heterogeneity in the some of the meta-analyses.The authors' conclusions reflect the evidence presented, but given the variability between (and methodological shortcomings within) the included studies, together with poor reporting of the review process, their reliability is uncertain. XIM: Practice: The authors stated that there may be a particular training need for clinical officers in light of the increase in wound infection and dehiscence compared with doctors.Research: The authors did not state any implications for further research.","Wilson, A; Lissauer, D; Thangaratinam, S; Khan, K S; MacArthur, C; Coomarasamy, A",,not included,41
A systematic review of episodic volunteering in public health and other contexts,"BACKGROUND: Episodic volunteers are a critical resource for public health non-profit activities but are poorly understood. A systematic review was conducted to describe the empirical evidence about episodic volunteering (EV) in the public health sector and more broadly. Study location, focus and temporal trends of EV research were also examined. METHODS: Twelve key bibliographic databases (1990-April week 2, 2014) were searched, including Google Scholar. Empirical studies published in English in peer-reviewed journals that identified participants as EVs who volunteered to support Not-for-Profit organisations in the health and social welfare sectors were included. EV definitions, characteristics, economic costs, antecedents and outcomes and theoretical approaches were examined. RESULTS: 41 articles met initial review criteria and 20 were specific to the health or social welfare sectors. EV definitions were based on one or more of three dimensions of duration, frequency, and task. EVs were predominantly female, middle aged, Caucasian (North American) and college/university educated. Fundraising was the most common EV activity and 72% had volunteered at least once. No studies examined the economic costs of EV. There was little consistency in EV antecedents and outcomes, except motives which primarily related to helping others, forming social connections, and self-psychological or physical enhancement. Most studies were atheoretical. Three authors proposed new theoretical frameworks. CONCLUSIONS: Research is required to underpin the development of an agreed consensus definition of EV. Moreover, an EV evidence-base including salient theories and measures is needed to develop EV engagement and retention strategies for the health and social welfare sectors.","Hyde, Melissa K; Dunn, Jeff; Scuffham, Paul A; Chambers, Suzanne K",BMC Public Health,not included,42
Imagine being a nice guy: A note on hypothetical vs. Incentivized social preferences,"We conducted an experimental study on social preferences using dictator games similar to Fehr et al. (2008). Our results show that social preferences differ between subjects who receive low-stakes monetary rewards for their decisions and subjects who consider hypothetical stakes. Our findings indicate that, apart from incentives, gender plays an important role for the categorization of different social preferences. © 2015.

Environmental certification programs: How does information provision compare with taxation?,"This paper develops a monopolistic competition framework to assess whether environmental certification programs can serve as effective substitutes for more traditional policy instruments such as environmental taxation or a minimum quality standard (MQS). I show that if firms can organize themselves and choose the certification standard collectively, then there is a beneficial role for a regulator to intervene. Also, the degree of substitution between differentiated goods that impose environmental damage and a “clean” outside good, the degree of competition in the industry and the extent of environmental damage caused by minimal quality goods are important considerations in the choice between a certification program and a tax or a MQS. While the comparison between a certification program and a tax depends on numerous factors, I find unequivocally that certification is a poor substitute for taxation whenever the outside good is a close substitute for differentiated goods, there is a high degree of competition in the industry or if minimal quality goods impose considerable environmental damage. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC","Podhorsky, A.",J.

A website to host educational modules on global engineering ethics and conduct research in cross-cultural moral psychology: A work in progress,"To ensure more long-term ethical behaviors within engineering, a website is being developed to host educational modules on global engineering ethics and conduct research on cross-cultural moral psychology. The modules are all-inclusive, with a cross-cultural and international focus, requiring less preparation on the part of instructors and are easier for different types of students to use than existing online resources. Education and research using the site can occur at the same time, each strengthening the other in the process. Rather than simply ethical understanding or the ability to reason ethically, research on moral psychology can ensure more ethical behaviors, better understanding what people know and think about ethics and the causes of (un)ethical behaviors. This research is cross-cultural, since culture has been shown to affect behaviors and thoughts related to ethics, and the educational and working environments of engineering are more cross-cultural and international than ever before. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2019","Clancy, R.F., III; Manuel, C.",ASEE Annu.

Consumer reaction to price increase: An investigation in gasoline industry,"Purpose – The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of increase in price of an essential product (i.e. gasoline) toward the focal product and other seemingly non-related products. Design/methodology/approach – A self-administered survey was used to collect data from the drivers at a large metroplex in Southwest USA. Multiple regression and scanning electron microscope procedures were used to analyze and test the proposed hypotheses. Findings – When consumers notice the increase in gas prices, they become very anxious. This anxiety is positively associated with average gas bought in gallons and negatively associated with threshold price. Further, this consumer anxiety has the strongest influence on lifestyle changes, followed by automobile technology change and transportation mode change, and has the weakest influence on gasoline brand/type change. Research limitations/implications – We focus on only anxiety as a mediator between increase in gas prices and the behavioral outcomes, and collect data from only one location. Practical implications – Managers must be cognizant that a price increase in essential goods not only influences the demand for focal products but also for products that may not seem related to the focal products. Social implications – Increase in gasoline price will not only affect the demand for gasoline, but also the demand for alternate forms of transportation, fuel efficient vehicles, and other aspects of life. Originality/value – This study is the first to look at the role of anxiety as a mediator and looks at the effects of increase in gas prices in a holistic manner. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Paswan, A.K.; Crawford, J.C.; Ngamsiriudom, W.; Nguyen, T.",J.

Internally Reporting Risk in Financial Services: An Empirical Analysis,"The enduring failure of financial institutions to identify and deal with risk events continues to have serious repercussions, whether in the form of small but significant losses or major and potentially far-reaching scandals. Using a mixed-methods approach that combines an innovative version of the classic dictator game to inform prosocial tendencies with the survey-based Theory of Planned Behaviour, we examine the risk-escalation behaviour of individuals within a large financial institution. We discover evidence of purely selfish behaviour that explains the lack significance in pressure to adhere to the Subjective Norms of colleagues around intention to report risks. A finding that has potentially important implications for efforts to instil a high-error management climate and incentivise risk reporting within organisations where risk, if ignored or unchecked, could ultimately have consequences that extend far beyond the institutions themselves.","Bryce, Cormac; Chmura, Thorsten; Webb, Rob; Stiebale, Joel; Cheevers, Carly",J.
