How construals of money versus time impact consumer charitable giving,"While past research has suggested that consumers have fundamentally different responses to thinking about money versus time, the current work clarifies an important nuance in terms of how consumers construe these two resources. We demonstrate that, in the domain of charitable giving, money is construed relatively more concretely, whereas time is construed relatively more abstractly. This difference in the construal of these two resources has implications for how appeals for charitable contributions or money versus time should be framed. When the construal level at which the consumer considers the cause is aligned (misaligned) with the construal level of the resource being requested, contribution intentions and behaviors increase (decrease). In addition, the moderating role of resource abundance is examined. In particular, when money is considered abundant (vs. nonabundant), consumers no longer exhibit more concrete thoughts in response to money compared to time. Finally, when the donation request makes consumers think of money in a more abundant manner, monetary donations can be successfully motivated with a more abstract call for charitable support. The theoretical and practical implications for marketers and charitable organizations are discussed. © The Author 2015.","Macdonnell, R.; White, K.",J. Consum. Res.,50
Guilt and giving: A process model of empathy and efficacy,"This research develops a model of consumer response to charity appeals. Using the Extended Parallel Process Model from the fear appeal literature as a foundation, the current model proposes that empathy and self-efficacy generate guilt and reduce maladaptive responses, which, in turn, shapes donation intention. The results demonstrate that the impact of empathy on charitable donation intention is fully mediated by guilt and maladaptive responses. The impact of self-efficacy is partially mediated by guilt and maladaptive responses. Therefore, both empathy and self-efficacy determine whether guilt or maladaptive responses result. This model clarifies the process through which guilt appeals operate, by identifying the roles of empathy and self-efficacy. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Basil, D.Z.; Ridgway, N.M.; Basil, M.D.",Psychol.

More for the many: The influence of entitativity on charitable giving,"Donations to large numbers of victims are typically muted relative to donations to a single identified victim. This article shows that people can donate more to large numbers of victims if these victims are perceived as entitative-comprisinga single, coherent unit. For example, donations to help children in need are higher when the children comprise a family than when they have no explicit group membership. The same effect is observed on donations for endangered animals that are depicted as moving in unison. Perceived entitativity results in more extreme judgments of victims. Victims with positive traits are therefore viewed more favorably when en-titative, triggering greater feelings of concern and higher donations. Entitativity has the opposite effect for victims sharing negative traits. © 2012 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc. All rights reserved.","Smith, R.W.; Faro, D.; Burson, K.A.",J. Consum. Res.,52
"Watching eyes and living up to expectations: Unkind, not kind, eyes increase first mover cooperation in a sequential prisoner’s dilemma","(1) Background: Why and when images of watching eyes encourage prosocial behavior is still subject to discussion, and two recent meta-analyses show no effect of watching eyes on generosity. This study aims to discern the effect of watching eyes of different valence on two separate aspects of prosocial behavior, and additionally investigates whether individuals’ social value orientation moderates the effect of eyes. (2) Methods: Individuals take on the role of either a first or second mover in an incentivized, anonymous sequential prisoner’s dilemma (n = 247), a two-person game which separates the need to form expectations about the other player (first mover cooperation, trust) from the motive of greed (second mover cooperation, reciprocity). During decision-making, a picture of either kind eyes, unkind eyes, or a control picture is presented above each decision matrix. (3) Results: The results indicate that unkind eyes, and not kind eyes, significantly boost first mover cooperation. In contrast, neither type of eye cues increase second mover cooperation. Social value orientation does not moderate these effects. (4) Conclusions: Thus, the data suggest that the valence of eye cues matters, and we propose that unkind eyes urge first movers to live up to the interaction partner’s expectations. © 2017 by the author.

"Emerging in a Digital World: A Decade Review of Media Use, Effects, and Gratifications in Emerging Adulthood","This article reviews the recent literature on uses, effects, and gratifications of media during emerging adulthood. We examine traditional media forms, including television, films, video games, music, and books, and also newer media, such as cell phones, social networking sites, and other Internet use. We find that emerging adults spend more time using the media than they spend doing any other activity, with the most time being spent on the Internet and listening to music. We also find that exposure to certain types of media content can influence both positive and negative outcomes in emerging adulthood, including, aggressive and prosocial behavior, body image, sexual behavior, friendship quality, and academic achievement. We also show that emerging adults use the media to gratify certain needs; key among these are for autonomy, identity, and intimacy needs. Finally, we discuss areas for future research involving media and emerging adulthood. © 2013 Society for the Study of Emerging Adulthood and SAGE Publications.","Coyne, S.M.; Padilla-Walker, L.M.; Howard, E.",Emerg.

Do Public Matching Funds and Tax Credits Encourage Political Contributions? Evidence from Three Field Experiments Using Nonpartisan Messages,"We report the results of three field experiments that provided nonpartisan information about municipal- and state-level incentives for making political contributions to potential donors. Our experiments examine two types of contribution incentive programs, public matching funds and tax credits, in three different jurisdictions: New York City, Virginia, and Ohio. We find that providing information about matching funds and tax credits has negligible effects on both the probability that an individual will make a contribution and the amount that an individual donates. Our findings suggest that publicizing contribution incentive programs using nonpartisan messages does little to enhance the pool of new donors. Our research leaves open the possibility that contribution incentive programs, and donation matching programs in particular, may nonetheless affect campaign behavior and encourage campaigns to pursue more small donors.

Does a More Diversified Revenue Structure Lead to Greater Financial Capacity and Less Vulnerability in Nonprofit Organizations? A Bibliometric and Meta-Analysis,"This article explores how and to what extent revenue diversification and concentration strategies affect financial performance, particularly financial capacity and vulnerability, in nonprofit organizations. Using a sample collected from a systematic literature search of all major databases, we first conducted a bibliometric analysis of 86 existing studies to visualize the clusters of major topics in this area and to explore the connections between existing studies. We then employed a meta-analysis to quantitatively synthesize 258 effect sizes from 23 existing empirical studies. We found that diversification had little effect on financial vulnerability, but it had a slightly negative effect on financial capacity. The article finally uses a meta-regression to discuss some of the theoretical and practical reasons why there is inconsistency in the results across existing studies and calls for more discussion of the assumptions and effectiveness of revenue diversification among nonprofit scholars and practitioners. © 2019, International Society for Third-Sector Research and The Johns Hopkins University.","Lu, J.; Lin, W.; Wang, Q.",Voluntas,58
The rate of brain death and organ donation in patients resuscitated from cardiac arrest: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"BACKGROUND: The occurrence of brain death in patients with hypoxic-ischaemic brain injury after resuscitation from cardiac arrest creates opportunities for organ donation. However, its prevalence is currently unknown. METHODS: Systematic review. MEDLINE via PubMed, ISI Web of Science and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were searched for eligible studies (2002-2016). The prevalence of brain death in adult patients resuscitated from cardiac arrest and the rate of organ donation among brain dead patients were summarised using a random effect model with double-arcsine transformation. The quality of evidence (QOE) was evaluated according to the GRADE guidelines. RESULTS: 26 studies [16 on conventional cardiopulmonary resuscitation (c-CPR), 10 on extracorporeal CPR (e-CPR)] included a total of 23,388 patients, 1830 of whom developed brain death at a mean time of 3.2 ± 0.4 days after recovery of circulation. The overall prevalence of brain death among patients who died before hospital discharge was 12.6 [10.2-15.2] %. Prevalence was significantly higher in e-CPR vs. c-CPR patients (27.9 [19.7-36.6] vs. 8.3 [6.5-10.4] %; p < 0.0001). The overall rate of organ donation among brain dead patients was 41.8 [20.2-51.0] % (9/26 studies, 1264 patients; range 0-100 %). The QOE was very low for both outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with hypoxic-ischaemic brain injury following CPR, more than 10 % of deaths were due to brain death. More than 40 % of brain-dead patients could donate organs. Patients who are unconscious after resuscitation from cardiac arrest, especially when resuscitated using e-CPR, should be carefully screened for signs of brain death.","Sandroni, Claudio; D'Arrigo, Sonia; Callaway, Clifton W; Cariou, Alain; Dragancea, Irina; Taccone, Fabio Silvio; Antonelli, Massimo",Intensive Care Med.,59
Nobody's watching? Subtle cues affect generosity an anonymous economic game,"Models indicate that opportunities for reputation formation can play an important role in sustaining cooperation and prosocial behavior. Results from experimental economic games support this conclusion, as manipulating reputational opportunities affects prosocial behavior. Noting that some prosocial behavior remains even in anonymous noniterated games, some investigators argue that humans possess a propensity for prosociality independent of reputation management. However, decision-making processes often employ both explicit propositional knowledge and intuitive or affective judgments elicited by tacit cues. Manipulating game parameters alters explicit information employed in overt strategizing but leaves intact cues that may affect intuitive judgments relevant to reputation formation. To explore how subtle cues of observability impact prosocial behavior, we conducted five dictator games, manipulating both auditory cues of the presence of others (via the use of sound-deadening earmuffs) and visual cues (via the presentation of stylized eyespots). Although earmuffs appeared to reduce generosity, this effect was not significant. However, as predicted, eyespots substantially increased generosity, despite no differences in actual anonymity; when using a computer displaying eyespots, almost twice as many participants gave money to their partners compared with the controls. Investigations of prosocial behavior must consider both overt information about game parameters and subtle cues influencing intuitive judgments. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

DOES SELF-PERCEPTION CHANGE EXPLAIN THE FOOT-IN-THE-DOOR EFFECT,"Consent to perform a small favor increases a respondent's susceptibility to perform a relatively large favor. This phenomenon, known as the foot-in-the-door effect, is considered to result from induced self-perception changes: the respondent comes to feel helpful for doing the small favor and complies again later out of a desire to maintain the instilled self-view. This study did not find a link between self-perception changes and large-request compliance in 2 experiments, although manipulations successfully altered self-rated helpfulness. Specifically, self-rated helpfulness increased (in Experiments 1 & 2) if participants' consent to a small favor brought social approval, and the ratings decreased (in Experiment 2) when social feedback for the small favor contained consensus information (i.e., indicated everyone else was also doing the favor). However, the ratings failed to predict either foot-in-the-door effects actually observed or compliance generally. Preexperimental gender differences in self-perceived helpfulness, in which women construed themselves to be more helpful than men, did successfully predict compliance with the large request. Implications for a theory of foot-in-the-door are discussed.","Gorassini, D R; Olson, J M",J. Pers. Soc. Psychol.,62
Endogenous federal grants and crowd-out of state government spending: Theory and evidence from the federal highway aid program,"Contrary to simple theoretical predictions, existing evidence suggests that federal grants do not crowd out state government spending. A legislative bargaining model with endogenous grants documents a positive correlation between grant receipts and preferences for public goods; this correlation has likely biased existing work against measuring crowd-out. To correct for such endogeneity, the model motivates instruments based on the political power of state congressional delegations. Exploiting this exogenous variation in grants, the instrumental variables estimator reports crowd-out that is statistically and economically significant. This endogeneity may explain the flypaper effect, a nonequivalence between grant receipts and private income.","Knight, B.",Am. Econ. Rev.,63
Meta-analyses in environmental and occupational health,"OBJECTIVES: Meta-analyses are considered generally as the highest level of evidence, but concerns have been voiced about their massive, low-quality production. This paper aimed to evaluate the landscape of meta-analyses in the field of occupational and environmental health and medicine. METHODS: Using relevant search terms, all meta-analyses were searched for, but those published in 2015 were assessed for their origin, whether they included randomised trials and individual-level data and whether they had authors from the industry or consultancy firms. RESULTS: PubMed searches (last update February 2017) identified 1251 eligible meta-analyses in this field. There was a rapid increase over time (n=16 published in 1995 vs n=163 published in 2015). Of the 163 eligible meta-analyses published in 2015, 49 were from China, followed at a distance by the USA (n=19). Only 16 considered randomised (intervention) trials and 13 included individual-level data. Only 1 of the 150 meta-analyses had industry authors and none had consultancy firm authors. As an example of conflicting findings, 12 overlapping meta-analyses addressed mobile phones and brain cancer risk and they differed substantially in number of studies included, eligibility criteria and conclusions. CONCLUSIONS: There has been a major increase in the publication of meta-analyses in occupational and environmental health over time, with the majority of these studies focusing on observational data, while a commendable fraction used individual-level data. Authorship is still limited largely to academic and non-profit authors. With massive production of meta-analyses, redundancy needs to be anticipated and efforts should be made to safeguard quality and protect from bias.","Ioannidis, John P A",Occup. Environ. Med.,64
Techniques of social influence: The psychology of gaining compliance,"Every day we are asked to fulfil others requests, and we make regular requests of others too, seeking compliance with our desires, commands and suggestions. This accessible text provides a uniquely in-depth overview of the different social influence techniques people use in order to improve the chances of their requests being fulfilled. It both describes each of the techniques in question and explores the research behind them, considering questions such as: How do we know that they work? Under what conditions are they more or less likely to be effective? How might individuals successfully resist attempts by others to influence them? The book groups social influence techniques according to a common characteristic: for instance, early chapters describe ""sequential"" techniques, and techniques involving egotistic mechanisms, such as using the name of ones interlocutor. Later chapters present techniques based on gestures and facial movements, and others based on the use of specific words, re-examining on the way whether ""please"" really is a magic word. In every case, author Dariusz Dolinski discusses the existing experimental studies exploring their effectiveness, and how that effectiveness is enhanced or reduced under certain conditions. The book draws on historical material as well as the most up-to-date research, and unpicks the methodological and theoretical controversies involved. The ideal introduction for psychology graduates and undergraduates studying social influence and persuasion, Techniques of Social Influence will also appeal to scholars and students in neighbouring disciplines, as well as interested marketing professionals and practitioners in related fields. © 2016 Dariusz Dolinski.

Predictors of future behaviour: A review of the psychological literature on blood donation,"Purpose. This paper explores the relative efficacy of different theoretical models to predict future behaviour. The behaviour studied in this case was the number of future blood donations. Based on this review, a commentary is provided on possible practical interventions. Method. Studies were included if they tested a theory and measured the number of actual donations over time. Both conventional and meta-analytic techniques were used to ascertain the efficacy of various theoretical models to predict the number of future blood donations. Results. Intentionality, from the theory of planned/reasoned action, emerged as the best predictor of future donor behaviour, but appeared to offer little in the way of suggesting interventions. The predictive power of intentionality reduced as the time interval between its measurement and the recording of actual donor behaviour increased. A number of organizational factors (e.g. waiting time) were identified as important and good predictors of future behaviour. Such factors offer possible interventions. Further, the stage-like nature of blood donor behaviour is highlighted. Conclusions. The transtheoretical model of behaviour change is introduced both as a viable alternative to theories like reasoned action and a conceptual framework for organizing interventions. The transtheoretical model is seen as applicable to the blood donation situation as it captures something of the stages of blood donation. It is also argued that other theoretical perspectives (e.g. self-efficacy) need to be examined in this context. © 1996 The British Psychological Society.","Ferguson, Eamonn",Br. J. Health Psychol.,66

Iron and hepcidin as risk factors in atherosclerosis: what do the genes say?,"BACKGROUND: Previous reports suggested a role for iron and hepcidin in atherosclerosis. Here, we evaluated the causality of these associations from a genetic perspective via (i) a Mendelian randomization (MR) approach, (ii) study of association of atherosclerosis-related single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with iron and hepcidin, and (iii) estimation of genomic correlations between hepcidin, iron and atherosclerosis. RESULTS: Analyses were performed in a general population sample. Iron parameters (serum iron, serum ferritin, total iron-binding capacity and transferrin saturation), serum hepcidin and genome-wide SNP data were available for N = 1,819; non-invasive measurements of atherosclerosis (NIMA), i.e., presence of plaque, intima media thickness and ankle-brachial index (ABI), for N = 549. For the MR, we used 12 iron-related SNPs that were previously identified in a genome-wide association meta-analysis on iron status, and assessed associations of individual SNPs and quartiles of a multi-SNP score with NIMA. Quartile 4 versus quartile 1 of the multi-SNP score showed directionally consistent associations with the hypothesized direction of effect for all NIMA in women, indicating that increased body iron status is a risk factor for atherosclerosis in women. We observed no single SNP associations that fit the hypothesized directions of effect between iron and NIMA, except for rs651007, associated with decreased ferritin concentration and decreased atherosclerosis risk. Two of six NIMA-related SNPs showed association with the ratio hepcidin/ferritin, suggesting that an increased hepcidin/ferritin ratio increases atherosclerosis risk. Genomic correlations were close to zero, except for hepcidin and ferritin with ABI at rest [-0.27 (SE 0.34) and -0.22 (SE 0.35), respectively] and ABI after exercise [-0.29 (SE 0.34) and -0.30 (0.35), respectively]. The negative sign indicates an increased atherosclerosis risk with increased hepcidin and ferritin concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest a potential causal role for hepcidin and ferritin in atherosclerosis, and may indicate that iron status is causally related to atherosclerosis in women.","Galesloot, Tessel E; Janss, Luc L; Burgess, Stephen; Kiemeney, Lambertus A L M; den Heijer, Martin; de Graaf, Jacqueline; Holewijn, Suzanne; Benyamin, Beben; Whitfield, John B; Swinkels, Dorine W; Vermeulen, Sita H",BMC Genet.,71
Assisted reproductive technologies: a systematic review of safety and effectiveness to inform disinvestment policy,"OBJECTIVE: Health policy relating to assisted reproductive technologies (ART) has been variably informed by clinical evidence, social values, political and fiscal considerations. This systematic review examined key factors associated with specific benefits and harms of ART to inform the development of a model for generating policy recommendations within an Australian disinvestment research agenda. METHODS: Six databases were searched from 1994 to 2009. Included articles contained data on safety and/or effectiveness of in vitro fertilisation (IVF) or IVF with intracytoplasmic sperm injection with reference to female age, male age or cycle rank. Narrative descriptions of key outcomes (live birth, miscarriage) were constructed alongside tabular summaries. RESULTS: Sixty-eight studies and one registry report were included. There was substantial heterogeneity present within the evidence-base which limited the strength and scope of conclusions that could be drawn. However, this review does affirm the differential effectiveness associated with the ageing of ART patients with regard to live birth and miscarriage. CONCLUSION: From the available evidence, it was not possible to determine an explicit age or cycle rank that could be used to formulate defensible policy responsive to identified differential effectiveness. Stakeholder interpretation of this evidence-base may assist in developing policy that can incorporate uncertainty and reflect social values.","Watt, Amber M; Elshaug, Adam G; Willis, Cameron D; Hiller, Janet E; ASTUTE Health study group",Health Policy,72
A Longitudinal Social Network Perspective on Adolescents' Exposure to Violent Video Games and Aggression,"Adolescents play video games as a social leisure activity, yet it is unclear whether peer influences play a role in spreading violent video game exposure (VVE) and aggression. It has been suggested that adolescents' aggression increases because of their friend's exposure to violent video games. This study tests this suggestion by using longitudinal social network analyses to investigate selection and socialization of aggression owing to VVE. A total of 796 adolescents from 34 different classrooms were followed from grade 7 to grade 8 (Mage = 12.60 years, 51 percent male adolescents). Exposure to violent video games, physical aggression, and within-classroom friendships were assessed at both time points. Data were analyzed by means of stochastic actor-based modeling in RSiena to estimate the effects of VVE and aggressive behavior on changes in friendships (selection), and the effects of friendships on changes in participants' VVE and aggressive behavior (socialization). Results showed homotypic selection effects, that is, adolescents became friends with peers who were similar in aggression and similar in violent video game exposure. Furthermore, there was a homotypic socialization effect, as friends became more similar in aggression over time. Friends did not become more similar in VVE over time. Violent games played by friends did not increase adolescents' own aggressive behavior. This suggests that concerns about peer influences on violent video games are unwarranted. Future studies on socialization processes of VVE should focus on influences from closest friends and investigate behavior during actual play. © 2021, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers.","Verheijen, G.P.; Burk, W.J.; Stoltz, S.E.M.J.; Van Den Berg, Y.H.M.; Cillessen, A.H.N.",Cyberpsychol.

"Social norms, feelings, and other factors affecting helping and altruism","This chapter discusses social norms, feelings, and other factors that influence helping and altruism. Externally derived incentives are undoubtedly major determinants of behavior, perhaps more important than internalized ideals for many persons and in many situations. But there is probably a far greater incidence of selfless action on behalf of others—even in the absence of reciprocal or anticipated benefits than the usual form of exchange theory. Some of this behavior, not all, is influenced by the operation of social rules and internalized standards of conduct. People sometimes act altruistically because this is the right thing to do in a given situation. On other occasions, however, they might help someone else because they empathize with him. The chapter also considers another complication: a person may deviate from social regulations in some instances even though he is firmly convinced of their propriety and has attempted to adhere to these standards in other situations; these occasional deviations do not mean that he or she does not believe in these rules or that they do not frequently govern his behavior. Other factors obviously may become potent determinants of behavior in some situations. Social-exchange conceptions apply to the organizational world because this setting promotes exchange concerns. Outside this milieu however, exchange ideas may be less influential as other motives, interests, and values come into play. Nonetheless, the findings reviewed in the chapter indicate that many normative conceptions of social behavior are vastly oversimplified. © 1972, Academic Press Inc.","Berkowitz, L.",Adv. Exp. Soc.

Confusion of Relative and Absolute Risk in Valuation,"Subjects were less willing to pay for government medical insurance for diseases when the number of people who could not be cured was higher, holding constant the number who could be cured. In a second experiment, willingness to pay (from a hypothetical government windfall) for risk reduction was unaffected by whether the risk was described in terms of percentage or number of lives saved, even though subjects knew that the risks in question differed in prevalence. These results are consistent with the findings of Fetherstonhaugh et al., Jenni and Loewenstein, and others. I suggest that these results can be explained in terms of a general tendency to confuse proportions and differences, a confusion that is analogous to other confusions of quantitative dimensions in children, adults, the news media, and perhaps even the epidemiological literature.","Baron, J.",J.

The case of income redistribution: A theory of government and private provision of collective goods,"Private philanthropy has been viewed alternately as a substitute for and supple ment to government income redistribution activities. In either case, we might expect that changes in consumer preferences for giving would, ceteris paribus, shift the demand for both types of philanthropy simultaneously. Previous studies of each form of giving have typically concentrated on identifying the determinants of such giving within a single-equation model, ignoring the existence of an alternative institution for the provision of philanthropy How ever, as long as philanthropic preferences remain only partially captured by explanatory variables utilized to explain either form of giving, equations esti mated separately by ordinary least squares techniques will exhibit correlated disturbance terms Zellner has shown that a joint generalized least squares pro cedure will, in such a situation, generate a more efficient estimation than separate estimation of single-equation models for each form of phrlanthropy Therefore, the approach taken here is to analyze the two mechanisms for giving together, within the framework of a two-equation Zellner-Aitken system, uti lizing time-series data for the period 1929 to 1966. © 1980, Sage Publications.

Should I Share That? Prompting Social Norms That Influence Privacy Behaviors on a Social Networking Site,"This study examines how explicit and implicit cues to social norms affect disclosure and privacy decisions in a Social Network Site (SNS) context. Study 1 revealed that participants' disclosure behavior adhered to explicit cues indicating disclosure frequency norms, while implicit social norm cues (i.e., surveillance primes) acted to increase overall disclosure frequency and affect disclosure accuracy when explicit cues discourage disclosure. Study 2 explored how these cues affected privacy-setting decisions and found that explicit cues indicating others' privacy settings could increase how strictly participants set their privacy settings, but the implicit cues had no effect. These results suggest that explicit cues about SNS norms can trigger bandwagon heuristic processing, and that, under limited circumstances, surveillance primes can affect self-disclosure. © 2017 International Communication Association","Spottswood, E.L.; Hancock, J.T.",J.

Bateson et al.'s (2006) Cues-of-being-watched paradigm revisited,"Bateson, Nettle, and Roberts (2006) provided an intriguing experimental paradigm for investigating the effects of social cues on cooperative behavior in a real-world setting. By placing an image of a pair of eyes on a cupboard door above an ""honesty box"" for hot beverages, they induced substantially higher amounts of contributions. As this finding has a significant impact on the social sciences and assumptions concerning the meaning of social cues for human behavior, we systematically reanalyzed their procedure and statistical analyses and tried to replicate the results while taking personality factors into account. The overall results of our analysis and replication efforts do not unequivocally support conclusions about the effects of eyes as social cues for cooperative behavior. Problems start with the definition of cooperative behavior, underspecified methods, confounding variables, invalid statistical analyses, and a lack of insight into the factors -including personality factors -that modulate the expected effect. A follow-up experiment with 138 participants showed no effect of eyes on socially relevant concepts and attitudes. Furthermore, none of the personality factors that, according to Bateson et al.'s explanation of reputational concerns, might be a source of effects interacted with any of the measures we used to operationalize these socially relevant concepts and attitudes. © 2011 by Verlag Hans Huber, Hogrefe AG, Bern.","Carbon, C.-C.; Hesslinger, V.M.",Swiss J.

The investigation consisted of analyzing more than 1,700 corresponding beta coefficients and correlation coefficients harvested from published studies. Results indicate that, under certain conditions, using knowledge of corresponding beta coefficients to impute missing correlations (effect sizes) generally produces relatively accurate and precise population effect-size estimates. Potential benefits from applying this knowledge include smaller sampling errors because of increased numbers of effect sizes and smaller nonsampling errors because of the inclusion of a broader array of research designs.","Peterson, R.A.; Brown, S.P.",J.

"Psychological Approaches to Sustainability: Current Trends in Theory, Research and Applications","An international team of leading scholars and young researchers in environmental psychology offers a relatively new perspective on the origin and solutions of the current environmental crisis. They explain how human nature has played a prominent role in the emergence of ecological problems such as global warming, threats to biodiversity, resources scarcity and pollution. But also, they demonstrate that such problems are interlinked with social problems such as poverty, famine, social and economical inequities and violence. According to this book's authors, psychological theories and empirical evidence show that the solutions for those socio-ecological problems are to be found in human nature and its psychological predispositions. These include personal motives, world-visions, future perspective, environmental emotions, altruistic tendencies and behavioural capacities among other psychological predispositions that could allow the adoption of sustainable lifestyles. Meeting the ideals of sustainability requires the participation of the natural and social sciences, including psychology, in order to guarantee the fulfilment of its purposes. Behavioural sciences study the psychological characteristics and the contextual factors that lead people to adopt more sustainable lifestyles. In addition, these sciences investigate how sustainable behaviours promote happiness, psychological well being and restoration, which are considered among the aims of sustainable development by governments throughout the world. The authors, who are recognised experts in these areas, offer a state-of-the-art review and data on what it is known regarding the psychological dimensions of the environmental crisis, its behavioural solutions and the repercussions of sustainable behaviour on human well-being.","Verdugo, Víctor Corral; Cadena, Cirilo Humberto García; Armenta, Martha Frías","Psychological Approaches to Sustainability: Current Trends in Theory, Research and Applications",83
Paradoxical effects of self-awareness of being observed: testing the effect of police body-worn cameras on assaults and aggression against officers,"Objectives: Recently, scholars have applied self-awareness theory to explain why body-worn cameras (BWCs) affect encounters between the public and police, with its most immediate manifestation being a reduction in the use of force by and complaints against police. In this study, we report on the paradoxical effects of BWCs in the context of assaults on officers. Methods: A multisite randomized controlled trial in ten departments, with officers wearing (or not wearing) BWCs based on random assignment of shifts. Odds ratios are used to estimate the treatment effect on assaults, along with “one study removed” sensitivity analyses. Further subgroup analyses are performed in terms of varying degrees of officers’ discretion, to enhance the practical applications of this multisite experiment. Finally, before-analyses are applied as well, including Bootstrapping and Monte-Carlo simulations to further validate the results under stricter statistical conditions, to illustrate the overall effects. Results: A total of 394 assaults per 1000 arrests occurred during 3637 treatment shifts (M = 39.35, SD = 17.89) compared with 284 assaults per 1000 arrests during 3697 control shifts (M = 28.38; SD = 15.99), which translate into 37% higher odds of assault in treatment shifts than in control conditions. The perverse direction and relative magnitude in each experimental site in eight out of ten sites were consistent. The backfiring treatment effect was substantially more pronounced in low discretion sites, i.e., where officers strongly followed the experimental protocol (OR = 2.565; 95% CI 1.792, 3.672). At the same time, before–after analyses show that assaults were overall reduced by 61% in the participating police departments, thus suggesting paradoxical effects. Conclusions: We explain these findings using self-awareness theory. Once self-aware that their performance is being observed by BWCs, officers become at risk of being assaulted. Results suggest that under some circumstances, self-awareness can lead to excessive self-inspection that strips power-holders of their ability to function under extreme situations. This mechanism is potentially a function of “over-deterrence”. The study further demonstrates the benefits of applying psychosocial theories to the study of social control and deterrence theories more broadly, with a robust and falsifiable mechanism that explains the conditions under which being observed stimulates either appropriate or perverse consequences. © 2017, The Author(s).","Ariel, B.; Sutherland, A.; Henstock, D.; Young, J.; Drover, P.; Sykes, J.; Megicks, S.; Henderson, R.",J.

The Nature of Psychological Reactance Revisited: A Meta-Analytic Review,"Psychological reactance (;) has been a long-standing topic of interest among scholars studying the design and effects of persuasive messages and campaigns. Yet, until recently, reactance was considered to be a motivational state that could not be measured. argued that reactance can be conceptualized as cognition and affect and made amenable to direct measurement. This article revisits Dillard and Shen's (2005) questions about the nature of psychological reactance and reports a test designed to identify the best fitting model of reactance. A meta-analytic review of reactance research was conducted (K = 20, N = 4,942) and the results were used to test path models representing competing conceptualizations of reactance. The results offer evidence that the intertwined model-in which reactance is modeled as a latent factor with anger and counterarguments serving as indicators-best fit the data. © 2012 International Communication Association.","Rains, S.A.",Hum.

The effects of endowment size and strategy method on third party punishment,"Numerous experiments have shown that people often engage in third-party punishment (3PP) of selfish behavior. This evidence has been used to argue that people respond to selfishness with anger, and get utility from punishing those who mistreat others. Elements of the standard 3PP experimental design, however, allow alternative explanations: it has been argued that 3PP could be motivated by envy (as selfish dictators earn high payoffs), or could be influenced by the use of the strategy method (which is known to influence second-party punishment). Here we test these alternatives by varying the third party’s endowment and the use of the strategy method, and measuring punishment. We find that while third parties do report more envy when they have lower endowments, neither manipulation significantly affects punishment. We also show that punishment is associated with ratings of anger but not of envy. Thus, our results suggest that 3PP is not an artifact of self-focused envy or use of the strategy method. Instead, our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that 3PP is motivated by anger. © 2015, Economic Science Association.","Jordan, J.; McAuliffe, K.; Rand, D.",Exp. Econ.,86
The impact of NHS based primary care complementary therapy services on health outcomes and NHS costs: a review of service audits and evaluations,"Uncontrolled health status data suggested that primary care complementary therapy services improved health outcome scores. Data on the impact of these services on NHS costs were scarcer and inconclusive. The overall quality of these evaluations was poor. XCM: The review question was clear and had appropriate inclusion criteria. Several relevant sources were searched. Efforts were made to reduce the potential for publication bias. It was unclear whether efforts were made to reduce reviewer error and bias throughout the review process. Validity was not assessed and it was, therefore, difficult to judge the quality of the included studies. The authors stated that study quality was poor overall. Most of the included studies appeared to be uncontrolled pre-post studies and used health service data, both of which were prone to various biases. A narrative synthesis was appropriate given the differences between studies. However, limiting studies in the review to those conducted in primary care settings in England and Wales meant that the results may not have been generalisable to other settings. Some relevant data were reported separately in tables. There were no data on characteristics of participants, which would have aided interpretation of outcome data. The authors' cautious conclusions appeared to reflect the poor quality evidence, however, due to the lack of validity assessment and the reporting of some data and review methods their reliability is uncertain. XIM: The authors did not state any implications for practice.Research: The authors stated that further robust research was required that utilised standardised health outcome tools and used appropriate statistical analysis. Further discussion within the NHS healthcare community was required to determine optimum ways of collecting and reporting NHS cost data for the evaluation of complementary therapy services within a primary care setting.","Wye, L; Sharp, D; Shaw, A",,87
Viewers Like You: Community Norms and Contributions to Public Broadcasting,"The logic of collective action (Olson 1965) suggests that public broadcasting may be underprovided, because non-contributors are not excluded from receiving the benefits. Why do so many individuals voluntarily contribute to public television, even though they can obtain the benefits of public television without contributing? We explore the hypothesis that giving to public broadcasting is determined in part by the strength of ""civic norms"" that limit the opportunistic behavior of individuals in large-numbers prisoners' dilemma settings. We also explore a variety of other explanations for charitable giving and collective action, including group size, tax deductibility, crowd out, and selective incentives. Our findings provide evidence linking civic norms and giving to public broadcasting. Education and income have indirect effects through strengthening civic norms. We find some evidence that selective incentives increase the average size of contributions among those who contribute.","Kropf, M.; Knack, S.",Polit. Res. Q.,88
Social image concerns and prosocial behavior: Field evidence from a nonlinear incentive scheme,"Using longitudinal data on the entire population of blood donors in an Italian town, we examine how donors respond to a nonlinear award scheme that rewards them with symbolic prizes (medals) when they reach certain donation quotas. Our results indicate that donors significantly increase the frequency of their donations immediately before reaching the thresholds for which the rewards are given, but only if the prizes are publicly announced in the local newspaper and awarded in a public ceremony. The results are robust to several specifications, sample definitions, and controls for observable and unobservable heterogeneity. Our findings indicate that social image concerns are a primary motivator of prosocial behavior and that symbolic prizes are most effective as motivators when they are awarded publicly. We discuss the implications of our findings for policies aimed at incentivizing prosocial behavior. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","Lacetera, N.; Macis, M.",J. Econ. Behav. Organ.,89

How sensitive is the average taxpayer to changes in the tax-price of giving?,"There is a substantial literature estimating the responsiveness of charitable donations to tax incentives for giving in the USA. One approach estimates the price elasticity of giving based on tax return data of individuals who itemize their deductions, a group substantially wealthier than the average taxpayer. Another estimates the price elasticity for the average taxpayer based on general population survey data. Broadly, results from both arms of the literature present a counterintuitive conclusion: the price elasticity of donations of the average taxpayer is larger than that of the average, wealthier, itemizer. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence that this conclusion results from a heretofore unrecognized downward bias in the estimator of the price elasticity of giving when non-itemizers are included in the estimation sample (generally with survey data). An intuitive modification to the standard model used in the literature is shown to yield a consistent and more efficient estimator of the price elasticity for the average taxpayer under a testable restriction. Strong empirical support is found for this restriction, and we estimate a bias in the price elasticity around − 1, suggesting the existing literature significantly over-estimates (in absolute value) the price elasticity of giving. Our results provide evidence of an inelastic price elasticity for the average taxpayer, with a statistically significant and elastic price response found only for households in the top decile of income. © 2018, The Author(s).","Backus, P.G.; Grant, N.L.",Int.

"Private virtues, public vices: social norms and corruption","Purpose – Corruption has traditionally been associated with an absence of pro-social norms such as trust and altruism. This paper challenges this view by examining market corruption – one-shot exchange transactions between strangers in the shadow of the law. The paper aims to propose that in the absence of repeat interactions and legal remedies to prevent contractual violations, acts of market corruption will require strong norms of generalized trust and altruism. As such, pro-social norms facilitate, rather than mitigate, market corruption. Design/methodology/approach – The paper utilizes meta-analysis to examine the relationship between pro-social behavior in economic experiments and prevailing corruption levels. Findings – The results from meta-analyses of both trust- and dictator game experiments show positive, significant relationships between pro-social norms and prevailing corruption levels. Research limitations/implications – The findings of the paper suggest the need for further research into the relationship between societal norms and different types of corruption. Practical implications – Policymakers should be wary about attempting to combat corruption through bottom-up policies designed to strengthen pro-social norms. Such policies may be counter-productive in that they are likely to provide the breeding ground for more acts of market corruption. Originality/value – Conventional wisdom suggests a negative association between pro-social norms and corruption levels. The paper proposes that the relationship is not that simple. Indeed, the meta-study findings suggest the reverse relationship in the case of petty (market) corruption. © 2013, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Mark Rosenbaum, S; Billinger, S; Stieglitz, N",International Journal of Development Issues,92
Prosocial video games reduce aggressive cognitions,"Previous research has shown that playing violent video games increased aggressive tendencies. However, as pointed out by the General Learning Model (GLM) [Buckley, K. E., & Anderson, C. A. (2006). A theoretical model of the effects and consequences of playing video games. In: P. Vorderer & J. Bryant (Eds.), Playing video games motives responses and consequences (pp. 363-378). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum], depending on their content, video games do not inevitably increase but may also decrease aggressive responses. Accordingly, the present research tested the hypothesis that playing prosocial video games decreases aggressive cognitions. In fact, playing a prosocial (relative to a neutral) video game reduced the hostile expectation bias (Experiment 1) and decreased the accessibility of antisocial thoughts (Experiment 2). Thus, these results lend credence to GLMs assumption that the effects of video game exposure depend to a great extent on the content of the game played. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Toward an Instance Theory of Automatization,"This article presents a theory in which automatization is construed as the acquisition of a domain-specific knowledge base, formed of separate representations, instances, of each exposure to the task. Processing is considered automatic if it relies on retrieval of stored instances, which will occur only after practice in a consistent environment. Practice is important because it increases the amount retrieved and the speed of retrieval; consistency is important because it ensures that the retrieved instances will be useful. The theory accounts quantitatively for the power-function speed-up and predicts a power-function reduction in the standard deviation that is constrained to have the same exponent as the power function for the speed-up. The theory accounts for qualitative properties as well, explaining how some may disappear and others appear with practice. More generally, it provides an alternative to the modal view of automaticity, arguing that novice performance is limited by a lack of knowledge rather than a scarcity of resources. The focus on learning avoids many problems with the modal view that stem from its focus on resource limitations.","Logan, G.D.",Psychol. Rev.,94
Disorganized welfare mixes: Voluntary agencies and new governance regimes in Western Europe,"In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in - though an insufficient understanding of - changes in the governance of welfare and related governance regimes, with the latter being conceptualized as systems of multifaceted inter-agency relations and associated modes of coordination. Referring to evidence from France, Britain and Germany, the article explores these changes with an eye on the role of voluntary organizations within these regimes. It challenges widespread typologies of 'welfare mixes' as well as general assumptions about international variation. It argues that, throughout Western Europe, similar governance regimes emerged in the postwar settlement, materializing in an 'organized welfare mix'. It then illustrates how these regimes currently undergo a process of permanent dis- and reorganization, again irrespective of international differences. Long-established patterns of a system-wide coordination via negotiated public-private partnerships turn into volatile configurations, with a growing albeit varying influence of the market rationale. Moreover, there is an increasing distance between voluntary provider organizations and both the welfare state and civil society, with this entailing precarious, but also more dynamic interrelations. Finally, civic action becomes more fluid, sporadic, dispersed but also more creative in many places. Hence, there is the paradox of the new welfare mixes exhibiting innovative dynamics and systematic organizational failure at the same time, with (more) output heterogeneity as an inevitable consequence.

Do grants to charities crowd out other income? Evidence from the UK,"We use a novel identification strategy to shed light on the effect of grant funding. We focus on charities that applied to a UK lottery grant programme. Where charities score the same on formal criteria, it is likely that informal criteria orthogonal to quality are used to break the ties, allowing us plausibly to treat a grant as a random event. We find evidence that grants have a positive impact for smaller charities, increasing their longevity and even crowding in other income. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Andreoni, J.; Payne, A.; Smith, S.",J.

Written and visual cyberbullying victimization in adolescence: Shared and unique associated factors,"The present study investigated the antecedents of cyberbullying victimization and addressed the commonalities and differences between visual and written forms of cyberbullying victimization among 3172 Italian adolescents (51.6% male, M age = 13.74 years, SD = 1.70) who participated in the Health Behaviour in School-Aged Children (HBSC, 2014) survey. The results from two logistic regression models revealed that the two distinct forms of cyberbullying victimization presented common and unique associated factors. Family support was negatively associated with both forms of cyberbullying victimization, while greater use of social networks and frequent experiences of traditional bullying victimization were positively associated with both forms. Neither written nor visual forms of cyberbullying victimization were associated with the quality of school relationships or online gaming frequency. Gender (female) was associated with written, but not visual, cyberbullying victimization. Finally, visual cyberbullying victimization was positively associated with high family socio-economic status and traditional bullying perpetration.

Source and message factors in persuasion: A reply to stiff’s critique of the elaboration likelihood model,"In this article we respond to James Stiffs (1986) recent critique of the Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM) of persuasion (Petty &amp; Cacioppo, 1981, 1986b), In particular, we make the following corrections to Stiffs misrepresentation of the model: (1) Many variables other than “involvement” can affect the elaboration likelihood and thus the route to persuasion, (2) variables can serve in multiple roles under specifiable conditions, and (3) the ELM does not preclude multi-channel information processing. After correcting these misperceptions of the ELM, we critique Stiffs meta-analyses comparing the ELM predictions with those he derives from Kahne-manys (1973) elastic capacity model. His analysis of message factors is critiqued on the grounds that some of the message factors included in the analysis are capable of affecting attitudes via either the central or the peripheral route. His analysis of source factors is critiqued on the grounds of insufficient sample size, lack of statistical significance, and possible miscategorization of studies. In short, we argue both that Stiffs presentation of the ELM and the conclusions he draws based on the data he presents are misleading. © 1987, Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.

"Cooperation among Norway Rats: The Importance of Visual Cues for Reciprocal Cooperation, and the Role of Coercion","Some animals reciprocate help, but the underlying proximate mechanisms are largely unclear. Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus) have been shown to cooperate in a variant of the iterated prisoner's dilemma paradigm, yet it is unknown which sensory modalities they use. Visual information is often implicitly assumed to play a major role in social interactions, but primarily nocturnal species such as Norway rats may rely on different cues when deciding to reciprocate received help. We used an instrumental cooperative task to compare the test rats' propensity to reciprocate received help between two experimental conditions, with and without visual information exchange between social partners. Our results show that visual information is not required for reciprocal cooperation among social partners because even when it was lacking, test rats provided food significantly earlier to partners that had helped them to obtain food before than to those that had not done so. The mean decision speed did not differ between the two experimental conditions, with or without visual information. Social partners sometimes showed aggressive behaviour towards focal test individuals. When including this in the analyses to assess the possible role of aggression as a trigger of cooperation, aggression received from cooperators apparently reduced the cooperation propensity, whereas aggression received from defectors increased it. Hence, in addition to reciprocity, coercion seems to provide additional means to generate altruistic help in Norway rats. © 2015 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.","Dolivo, V.; Taborsky, M.",Ethology,100

Altruism towards strangers in need: costly signaling in an industrial society,"In the present study, the costly signaling theory (CST) is used to examine the effect of an offer of charity on social recognition. On behalf of a charitable organization, 186 students enrolled in 16 different courses were asked to offer support to unfamiliar persons in need. In accordance with our predictions, the results show that significantly more subjects are willing to give assistance if they make charity offers in the presence of their group members than when the offers are made in secret. In accordance with CST-but not with the prevailing explanations in social psychology-the likelihood of charity service was strongly influenced by the expected cost of altruistic behavior. Publicly demonstrated altruistic intentions yielded long-term benefits: Subjects who were willing to participate in a particular charity activity gained significantly higher sociometry scores (as a sign of social recognition) than did others. The cost of volunteerism correlated with social recognition in the case of a charity act judged as the most expensive (giving assistance to mentally retarded children), but not for the other categories of charity offer. Our results suggest that public generosity towards strangers as a costly signal may convey reliable information about subjects' personality traits, such as cooperativeness, but our data do not support the hypothesis that the signaling mechanism is related to sexual selection and mate choice. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Development and Evaluation of the Chronic Time Pressure Inventory,"The negative effects of chronic time pressure (i.e., time shortage and feelings of being rushed) are pervasive within modern society. Noting this, and the absence of an established self-report measure, the present paper developed and evaluated the Chronic Time Pressure Inventory (CTPI). Established theory informed the generation of items, resulting in an initial 15-item measure. Study 1, using parallel analysis, exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis, examined CTPI factorial structure within a sample of 401 respondents. Additionally, reliability (omega and alpha) and convergent validity testing occurred by correlating the CTPI with the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10). Study 2 replicated the emergent, superior factor model in an independent sample of 163 respondents and assessed measurement invariance. Analysis further examined reliability (omega and alpha) and convergent validity. Across the two studies, results supported a bifactor solution, where a general overarching factor encompassed two discrete, but overlapping temporal factors (i.e., Feeling Harried and Cognitive Awareness of Time Shortage). Invariance testing indicated invariance of form, factor loadings, item intercepts and residuals across Study 1 and 2. The CTPI also demonstrated good internal reliability and satisfactory convergent validity with the PSS-10. Findings supported Szollos’ (2009) theoretical conceptualization of chronic time pressure and established the CTPI as a psychometrically sound, theoretically aligned measure of the construct. Indeed, results advocate the CTPI as a promising instrument for conducting survey-based research into chronic time pressure. © Copyright © 2019 Denovan and Dagnall.","Denovan, A.; Dagnall, N.",Front.

"The Beautiful Complexity of Human Prosociality: On the Interplay of Honesty-Humility, Intuition, and a Reward System","Human prosociality is a fascinating and complex phenomenon. The present research takes this complexity into account by examining the interplay of three prominent factors that past research has shown to promote prosocial behavior. In two studies (total N = 1,799), we tested the impact of (a) a basic prosocial personality trait (the Honesty-Humility dimension from the HEXACO personality model), (b) intuitive decision making, and (c) the possibility of being rewarded (i.e., a reward system) in the emergence of prosocial behavior (i.e., dictator game giving). Replicating previous research, we found that (1) a reward system increased prosocial behavior and (2) Honesty-Humility was positively related to prosocial behavior. In addition, given that there was no reward system, we show that intuition (vs. a control condition) reduced prosocial behavior in individuals low in Honesty-Humility, whereas no effect was found for individuals high in Honesty-Humility. Implications for the understanding of prosocial behavior are discussed. © The Author(s) 2020.","Nockur, L.; Pfattheicher, S.",Soc. Psychol. Pers. Sci,107

The fundamentals of performance measurement systems: A systematic approach to theory and a research agenda,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to identify the fundamentals of a performance measurement system (PMS) as discussed in the literature for the past 32 years in an attempt to provide a research agenda (RA) for future research. Design/methodology/approach: The paper uses a systematic review of the business, public and non-profit sector literature in examining what constitutes the fundamentals of PMS, and how these fundamentals have influenced the use of data (especially on non-financial data), development of measuring methods, measuring attributes and measuring process. Findings: The paper finds that there are a small number of articles providing that can be considered to have provided substantial discussion of the fundamentals of PMS. While there is no consensus on what constitute the fundamentals of PMS, using content analysis, citation analysis and on the strict criteria of necessary and/or sufficient for the existence of a PMS, this paper managed to characterize the fundamentals into six categories. This paper found that the field of PMS has not change much during the past 30 or more years, and there remains various pragmatic and research gaps that need to be addressed. Practical implications: The results, outcomes, and analysis of this paper have both practical and academic implications. The gaps and recommendations for future research is consolidated into a RA that provides practitioners to evaluate existing PMS, avoid issues and seek ways to develop a conceptual (theoretical) PMS that is of greater practical significance. Originality/value: The results of this study contribute toward providing an update of the current state of development and research into PMS; and managed to identify existing practical issues and research gaps of PMS, and provided a RA on which ongoing and future research efforts on this topic can be built upon.

"Voting for environmental donations: Experimental evidence from Majorca, Spain","This paper presents the results of a modified dictator game where donors are tourists in the island of Majorca, Spain, and the recipient is an environmental foundation. In this experiment we explore if the level of voluntary donations varies under different treatments that include taxes (high and low levels) and voting treatments on choosing and obligatory imposition of taxes (high vs. low and low vs. no tax). Our results show that participants only self-impose mandatory contributions when they must choose between a high or low tax, and rarely passing the high tax. In addition, we find that those individuals who voted for a high tax and are in a group where the majority votes for the low tax conform to their earlier vote by contributing more. Further, our data supports an incomplete crowding-out of voluntary donations by the application of tourism taxes ear-marked for environmental purposes. From a policy perspective, this result supports the potential for a complementary use of taxes and voluntary donations for fundraising environmental projects in tourism destinations. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Blanco, E.; Lopez, M.C.; Coleman, E.A.",Ecol.

The Effect of Stake Size in Experimental Bargaining and Distribution Games: A Survey,"We review the literature on bargaining and distribution experiments to investigate whether changes in stake size have significant effects on behaviour in laboratory/field settings. We conclude that experiments in this field do not lead to clear/common results. The joint presence of opposing factors (e.g., increasing relative risk aversion and increasing cost of fairness) might be one reason contributing to this. Moreover, we argue that variables such as subjects’ financial conditions, cognitive abilities, risk attitudes, loss-aversion, justice orientations, and relevant personality characteristics should be controlled in laboratory experiments to understand the effect of stake size on behaviour, more clearly. Finally, quasi-experiments using data from (very) high-stake games/events and meta-analysis studies should complement (individual) controlled experiments. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Karagözoğlu, E.; Urhan, Ü.B.",Group Decis.

Natural-field dictator game shows no altruistic giving,"Economic experiments are increasingly being used in a number of research areas and are a major source of data guiding the debate surrounding the nature of human prosociality. The degree to which experiment behavior accurately reflects external behavior, however, has long been debated. A number of recent studies have revealed just how remarkably sensitive participants are to cues of a lack of anonymity. Similarly, others have suggested that the very structure of the experimental context induces participants to choose prosocial options. In order to truly create anonymous conditions and to eliminate the effects of experimental contexts, participants must not be aware of their participation. Here, I present the results of a natural-field Dictator Game in which participants are presented with a believable endowment and provided an opportunity to divide the endowment with a stranger without knowing that they are taking part in an experiment. No participants gave any portion of the endowment to the stranger. Baseline frequencies of prosocial behaviors exhibited under experimental contexts might therefore be substantially inflated compared to those exhibited under natural contexts. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","Winking, J.; Mizer, N.",Evol.

Organ donation and transplantation: Awareness and roles of healthcare professionals-A systematic literature review,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To examine the role of healthcare professionals in the organ donation and transplantation process. BACKGROUND: Globally, there remains a perennial disequilibrium between organ donation and organ transplantation. Several factors account for this disequilibrium; however, as healthcare professionals are not only strategically positioned as the primary intermediaries between organ donors and transplant recipients, but also professionally situated as the implementers of organ donation and transplantation processes, they are often blamed for the global organ shortage. DESIGN: Mixed-method systematic review using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic review and Meta-Analysis Protocols 2015 checklist. METHODS: Databases were searched including CINAHL, MEDLINE, Web of Science and EMBASE using the search terms ""organ donation,"" ""healthcare professionals,"" ""awareness"" and ""roles"" to retrieve relevant publications. RESULTS: Thirteen publications met the inclusion criteria. The global organ shortage is neither contingent upon unavailability of suitable organs nor exclusively dependent upon healthcare professionals. Instead, the existence of disequilibrium between organ donation and transplantation is necessitated by a web of factors. These include the following: healthcare professionals' attitudes towards, and experience of, the organ donation and transplantation process, underpinned by professional education, specialist clinical area and duration of professional practice; conflicts of interests; ethical dilemmas; altruistic values towards organ donation; and varied organ donation legislations in different legal jurisdictions. CONCLUSION: This review maintains that if this web of factors is to be adequately addressed by healthcare systems in different global and legal jurisdictions, there should be sufficient organs voluntarily donated to meet all transplantation needs. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: There is a suggestion that healthcare professionals partly account for the global shortage in organ donation, but there is a need to examine how healthcare professionals' roles, knowledge, awareness, skills and competencies might impact upon the organ donation and transplantation process.","Jawoniyi, Oluwafunmilayo; Gormley, Kevin; McGleenan, Emma; Noble, Helen Rose",J.

Physical Attractiveness and Altruism in Two Modified Dictator Games,"Several studies find that male individuals are more altruistic toward attractive women, suggesting altruism may serve as a courtship display. Many studies exploring this phenomenon have used vignettes and facial images. We tested the sexual selection hypothesis as an explanation for altruistic behavior, where players played the dictator game with “live” participants. Two studies were conducted (Study 1, n = 212; Study 2, n = 188) where we manipulated stakes and anonymity between participants to explore the relationship between the dictator’s allocations and their perceived attractiveness of the recipient. We found no relationship between attractiveness and altruism. Dictators were consistently fair when allocating stakes, irrespective of the recipients’ attractiveness. © 2016, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Bhogal, M.S.; Galbraith, N.; Manktelow, K.",Basic Appl.

An Experimental Examination of US Individual Donors’ Information Needs and Use,"This paper adopts an internet-based experiment to investigate whether and how individual donors use nonprofit organizations’ financial and nonfinancial information when making their donation decisions. Using undergraduate students in the United States (US) to proxy for individual donors, our results indicate that individual donors are more likely to acquire nonfinancial information, such as nonprofit organizations’ goals, outcomes, programs and missions, than financial information. Donors integrate nonfinancial information into their decisions as their actual donations are significantly correlated with such information. Our results also indicate that while individual donors acquire financial efficiency measures, including the program expense ratio and fundraising expense ratio, they do not seem to integrate such information into their decisions as their actual donations are not significantly correlated with the efficiency information. This study contributes to the nonprofit literature and research domain focusing on charitable giving and donor preferences. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","McDowell, E.A.; Li, W.; Smith, P.C.",Financ.

The effects and risks associated to mephedrone and methylone in humans: A review of the preliminary evidences,"New psychoactive substances have drastically modified the world drug scene. An increasingly popular class comprises synthetic or substituted cathinones (legal highs, research chemicals, bath salts). Among the most common psychoactive constituents of bath salts are mephedrone and methylone. Recent reports on the abuse of novel synthetic cathinone derivatives call attention to the serious physical and psychological risks resulting from their consumption, thereby emphasizing the growing use of these drugs might constitute an important public health issue. In this paper, we will review the available data regarding the use and effects of mephedrone and methylone in humans in order to highlight their impact on public health. To reach this objective, a literature search was performed on two representative databases (Pubmed, Google Scholar), the Erowid Center website (a US non-profit educational organization that provides information about psychoactive plants and chemicals), and various governmental websites. The terms used for the database search were ""mephedrone"", ""methylone"", ""new psychoactive substances"", ""synthetic cathinones"", ""substituted cathinones"", ""substance abuse"", ""substance use disorder"", ""adverse effects"", ""fatalities"". The literature search was limited to years 2005-2015 and led to the identification of 71 potentially relevant articles. To date, the actual prevalence rates of their use remains difficult to estimate. Important health-related issues have emerged in relation to the somatic, psychiatric, and addictive consequences of their use. The potential chronic health effects of their prolonged use remain to date unknown (e.g., reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential). Treatment for patients with prolonged exposure to synthetic cathinones should ideally include a drug management plan coupled with psychotherapy taking place in a structured program of care.","Karila, Laurent; Billieux, Joel; Benyamina, Amine; Lançon, Christophe; Cottencin, Olivier",Brain Res.

The purpose (and perils) of Government-nonprofit partnership,"This study seeks to understand similarities and differences in why local governments and nonprofits choose to collaborate, particularly when those relationships are not governed by formal contracts or grants. Exchange, transaction, and resource dependence theories are used to understand the perceived advantages and disadvantages of collaboration as expressed by local government and nonprofit executives. Based on two large, comparable samples from Georgia, the analysis finds that the two sectors demonstrate a remarkable similarity in the benefits they seek from public-private partnerships, but with some key differences. The motivation to partner is driven by a desire to secure those resources most scarce for the respective sector: expertise and capacity for government, funding for nonprofits. Nonprofit executives generally exhibit a stronger undercurrent of negativity toward intersectoral partnership than do their public sector counterparts. This article discusses possible reasons for these similarities and differences and contributes to the scholarship linking capacity with organizational outcomes. © 2007 Association for Research on Nonprofit Organizations and Voluntary Action.","Gazley, B.; Brudney, J.L.",Nonprofit Volunt.

A systematic review of interventions to detect dementia or cognitive impairment,"BACKGROUND: Memory services have been implemented nationally to increase early dementia diagnosis, and further evaluation of their impact and other strategies to increase timely dementia diagnosis are needed. AIMS: To systematically review the literature for interventions intended to increase the detection of dementia or suspected dementia or people presenting with memory complaints. METHOD: We searched electronic databases, hand searched references and contacted authors of included papers, contacted field experts and UK charities and councils for data about their dementia awareness programmes. RESULTS: We included 13 studies, of which four were randomised controlled trials (RCT). Two RCTs found that general practitioner (GP) education increased suspected dementia cases. One RCT found up to six home visits from a specialist geriatric nurse over 30 months increased the rate of accurately diagnosed dementia. There was preliminary evidence from non-randomised studies that memory clinics increase timely diagnosis, but no evidence they increase the overall diagnosis rate. CONCLUSIONS: There is good quality evidence that GP education increases the number of suspected dementia cases but not accurate or earlier dementia diagnoses. One RCT reported that multiple visits from a trained nurse increase the diagnosis rate. There is no cost effectiveness evidence. Our findings suggest good quality RCTs are needed to test the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of interventions to increase dementia detection.","Mukadam, Naaheed; Cooper, Claudia; Kherani, Nishin; Livingston, Gill",Int.

Green when seen? No support for an effect of observability on environmental conservation in the laboratory: A registered report,"Understanding how humans navigate the tension between selfish and prosocial behaviour is central to addressing social dilemmas and several environmental issues. Many accounts predict that human prosociality would increase in the presence of observing individuals. Previous studies on this observability effect predominantly relied on artificial observability manipulations and low-cost measures of prosociality. In the present Registered Report, we used a recently validated laboratory procedure of repeated dilemmas to test whether the presence of actual observers affects costly prosocial behaviour in the domain of environmental conservation. When completing this dilemma task, participants repeatedly chose between minimizing the length of the laboratory session and minimising wasted energy from a bank of LED lights. Their choices were made either in private or in the presence of actual observers. Contrary to our expectation, we did not observe higher rates of energy-conserving behaviour when participants' choices were being observed. Manipulation and robustness checks indicate that this lack of a finding is unlikely to be owing to arbitrary methodological choices. In view of these findings, we argue that a more comprehensive analysis of situation- and behaviour-specific consequences might be necessary to predict how particular behaviours are affected by observability. © 2020 Royal Society Publishing.

Picturing Generosity: Explaining the Success of National Campaigns in the Netherlands,"In this study, we investigate the success of national campaigns for charitable causes in the Netherlands using historical data from archival sources, including newspapers, and the internet. We describe the 102 national campaigns held in the Netherlands between 1951 and 2011, focusing on uniquely Dutch contextual features such as a society organized along vertical pillars and highly formalized collaboration between international aid organizations. We then formulate and test hypotheses concerning possible explanations for the success of national campaigns as a specific type of fundraising campaign. We focus on the effect of campaigns organized for ""innocent"" victims, versus campaigns organized for victims of man-made disasters, the effect of media coverage on campaigns, campaign frequency, government contributions, and economic conditions. The results show that campaigns for victims of man-made disasters are less successful. Campaigns organized in periods of fewer competing campaigns and campaigns receiving government support are more successful. © The Author(s) 2013.","Wiepking, P.; van Leeuwen, M.H.D.",Nonprofit Volunt.

A review of personality/religiousness associations,"We review research on personality/religiousness associations, integrating earlier meta-analyses with recent large-sample online studies. We find that general religiousness shows small positive associations with broad personality factors (e.g. HEXACO Honesty-Humility, Big Five Agreeableness, Conscientiousness) and somewhat stronger positive associations with narrower personality traits involving prosocial tendencies (e.g. altruism, fairness, forgivingness). The link between religiousness and prosociality appears not to be an artifact of self-report method variance. Religious fundamentalism and spirituality show negative and positive associations, respectively, with the Openness factor of personality. Religiousness/personality associations tend to be weak in relatively non-religious countries but moderately strong in highly religious countries. The direction of causal influence between personality and religiousness is not yet clear. Religiousness shows modest negative associations with IQ and appears to be somewhat negatively related to scientific thinking. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Ashton, M.C.; Lee, K.",Curr. Opin. Psychol.,127

Gender-based pairings influence cooperative expectations and behaviours,"The study explores the expectations and cooperative behaviours of men and women in a lab-in-the-field experiment by means of citizen science practices in the public space. It specifically examines the influence of gender-based pairings on the decisions to cooperate or defect in a framed and discrete Prisoner’s Dilemma game after visual contact. Overall, we found that when gender is considered behavioural differences emerge in expectations of cooperation, cooperative behaviours, and their decision time depending on whom the partner is. Men pairs are the ones with the lowest expectations and cooperation rates. After visual contact women infer men’s behaviour with the highest accuracy. Also, women take significantly more time to defect than to cooperate, compared to men. Finally, when the interacting partners have the opposite gender they expect significantly more cooperation and they achieve the best collective outcome. Together, the findings suggest that non verbal signals may influence men and women differently, offering novel interpretations to the context-dependence of gender differences in social decision tasks. © 2020, The Author(s).","Cigarini, A.; Vicens, J.; Perelló, J.",Sci.

Funding nonprofits in a networked society: Toward a network framework of government support,"This study considers the effects of government funding to nonprofits from a network perspective. By analyzing a novel, 12-year panel dataset from the People's Republic of China, I find no evidence that government funding to a nonprofit crowds out private donations to the same organization. However, I find a substantial crosswise crowding-in effect at the ego network level: an increase of one Chinese Yuan in government funding to a nonprofit's neighbor organizations in board interlocking network can increase the private giving to the nonprofit by 0.4 Chinese Yuan. A nonprofit's network position measured by Katz centrality negatively associates with its private giving. The results suggest that, if we consider the funding system from a holistic network perspective, government should support nonprofits with confidence because of the spillover effect. Moreover, a nascent nonprofit cannot increase donor's confidence by only borrowing board members from renowned organizations. © 2020 The Author.

Tax Incentives and Charitable Contributions: The Evidence from Censored Quantile Regression,"This paper investigates the relationship between tax price and charitable contributions using the censored quantile regression (QR) technique, which can provide a complete description of the whole distribution of giving, and data from US Internal Revenue Service individual tax returns. The findings of the present study are as follows. First, the price elasticities of charitable contributions are all negative and consistently decrease in absolute value along the quantiles. Second, donors at lower giving quantiles are price elastic but donors at higher quantiles are price inelastic. Third, the income elasticities are positive and increase along the quantiles. Lastly, the effects of wealth, age, marital status, and the number of dependents vary across quantiles. All the empirical results show that the censored QR offers better explanations on the relationship between tax incentives and charitable contributions. © 2012 Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.","Lin, H.-Y.; Lo, K.-T.",Pac.

The effects of increased dose of exercise-based therapies to enhance motor recovery after stroke: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Available evidence provided some limited support for the hypothesis that a higher dose of the same type of exercise based therapy enhanced motor recovery after stroke. XCM: The review addressed a focused question, supported by clearly defined inclusion criteria. The literature search involved an appropriate range of databases with efforts to locate studies that may have been missed by the searches and potential unpublished data. However, the restriction of the review to studies in English raised the possibility of language bias. Appropriate steps were taken to minimise bias and errors at all stages of the review process.Trial quality was assessed using appropriate criteria. The results of the quality assessment were clearly presented, although only three trials were judged to be at low risk of bias. The synthesis appears to have been appropriate, although details on the methods used to assess heterogeneity and the results of the assessment of heterogeneity were not reported. However, as meta-analysis was only possible for a small number of outcomes, which were only evaluated in two or three trials and the results for each primary trial were presented, this was not likely to have influenced the results of the review. Overall, most comparisons showed no significant differences between the two doses of therapy.This was a generally well-conducted review, but interpretation of the authors’ conclusions should bear in mind that support for a higher dose was only found for a limited number of outcomes, with most comparisons showing no differences between therapy doses. XIM: Practice: The authors stated that the limited evidence restricts the provision of clear guidance on whether an increased dose of exercise-based therapy enhances recovery after stroke.Research: The authors stated that prospective robust clinical trials are needed to investigate whether time after stroke influences motor response to different doses of exercise based therapies. They also stated that there is a need to undertake dose-finding studies of specific exercise-based interventions as precursors to robust clinical trials.","Cooke, E V; Mares, K; Clark, A; Tallis, R C; Pomeroy, V M",,136
The relationship between green space and prosocial behaviour among children and adolescents: A systematic review,"The plausible role of nearby green space in influencing prosocial behaviour among children and adolescents has been studied recently. However, no review has been conducted of the evidence testing the association between green space and prosocial behaviour. This systematic review addresses this gap among children and adolescents. Within this review, we propose a conceptual framework describing potential pathways linking green space to prosocial behaviour, discuss the direction, magnitude, moderators, and mediators of the association, and develop a narrative synthesis of future study directions. Out of 63 extracted associations from 15 studies, 44 were in the positive or expected direction, of which 18 were reported to be statistically significant (p < 0.05). Overall, the current evidence shows that exposure to green space may potentially increase prosocial behaviour among children and adolescents, with some contingencies (e.g., child’s sex and ethnic background). However, the volume and quality of this evidence is not yet sufficient to draw conclusions on causality. Further, heterogeneity in the indicators of green space exposure could lead to mixed findings. In addition, none of the included studies investigated potential mediators. Nevertheless, this review provides preliminary evidence and a basis for further investigation with rigorous study methodology capable of drawing causal inferences and testing potential effect modifiers, linking pathways, and relevant green space measures. © 2020 Putra, Astell-Burt, Cliff, Vella, John and Feng.","Putra, I.G.N.E.; Astell-Burt, T.; Cliff, D.P.; Vella, S.A.; John, E.E.; Feng, X.",Front.

Self-image and moral balancing: An experimental analysis,"In our experiment, a dictator game variant, the reported outcome of a die roll determines the endowment (low/high) in a subsequent dictator game. In one treatment the experimenter is present and no cheating is possible, while in another subjects can enter the result of the roll themselves. Moral self-image is also manipulated in the experiment preceding ours. The aim of this experimental set up is to analyze dynamic aspects of moral behavior.When cheating is possible, substantially more high endowments are claimed and transfers of high-endowed dictators are bigger than when cheating is not possible (mediated by the preceding moral self-image manipulation). The preceding manipulations also have a direct effect on generosity, when subjects have to report the roll of the die truthfully. Moral balancing appears to be an important factor in individual decision making. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Ploner, M.; Regner, T.",J. Econ. Behav. Organ.,138
"Cost-effectiveness of nucleic acid test screening of volunteer blood donations for hepatitis B, hepatitis C and human immunodeficiency virus in the United States","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to examine the cost-effectiveness of adding nucleic acid testing (NAT) to serological (antibody and antigen) screening protocols for donated blood in the United States (US) with the purpose of reducing the risks of transfusion-transmission of hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The costs, health consequences and cost-effectiveness of adding either minipool or individual-donor NAT to serological screening (SS) testing were estimated using a decision-analysis model. RESULTS: With the given modelling assumptions, adding minipool NAT would avoid an estimated 37, 128 and eight cases of HBV, HCV and HIV, respectively, and save approximately 53 additional years of life and 102 additional quality adjusted life years (QALYs) compared with SS, at a net cost of $154 million. SS + minipool NAT - p24 compared with SS alone resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $1.5 million per QALY gained (range in sensitivity analysis $1.0-2.1 million per QALY gained) in this US analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The cost effectiveness of adding NAT screening is outside the typical range for most healthcare interventions, but not for established blood safety measures.","Marshall, D A; Kleinman, S H; Wong, J B; AuBuchon, J P; Grima, D T; Kulin, N A; Weinstein, M C",Vox Sang.,139
The evolution of general intelligence,"The presence of general intelligence poses a major evolutionary puzzle, which has led to increased interest in its presence in nonhuman animals. The aim of this review is to critically evaluate this question and to explore the implications for current theories about the evolution of cognition. We first review domain-general and domain-specific accounts of human cognition in order to situate attempts to identify general intelligence in nonhuman animals. Recent studies are consistent with the presence of general intelligence in mammals (rodents and primates). However, the interpretation of a psychometric g factor as general intelligence needs to be validated, in particular in primates, and we propose a range of such tests. We then evaluate the implications of general intelligence in nonhuman animals for current theories about its evolution and find support for the cultural intelligence approach, which stresses the critical importance of social inputs during the ontogenetic construction of survival-relevant skills. The presence of general intelligence in nonhumans implies that modular abilities can arise in two ways, primarily through automatic development with fixed content and secondarily through learning and automatization with more variable content. The currently best-supported model, for humans and nonhuman vertebrates alike, thus construes the mind as a mix of skills based on primary and secondary modules. The relative importance of these two components is expected to vary widely among species, and we formulate tests to quantify their strength. © 2017 Cambridge University Press.","Burkart, J.M.; Schubiger, M.N.; Van Schaik, C.P.",Behav.

Does vasopressin improve survival?,"Vasopressin does not improve survival outcomes in sudden cardiac arrest compared with epinephrine, but it is a safe alternative vasopressor. XCM: The review assessed a clear question and had clearly defined inclusion criteria. The author searched some relevant databases, but his decision to limit the review to peer-reviewed studies might have increased the possibility that some relevant studies were not included in the review, particularly as he did not report assessing publication bias. The author did not report using methods designed to reduce bias and error when selecting studies for the review or extracting the data, nor did he report a formal assessment of validity. In addition, only limited characteristics of the included studies were reported. The decision to use meta-analysis appears appropriate given the clinical homogeneity of the included studies, but the statistical methods used were poorly reported and there was no apparent assessment of statistical heterogeneity. The author's conclusion and recommendations appear appropriate given the evidence presented but, given the lack of a validity assessment and the poor reporting of review methodology, their reliability cannot be established. XIM: Practice: The author stated that the American Heart Association should add vasopressin to the asystolic and pulseless electrical activity guidelines, with a classification of Class indeterminate (no harm, possible benefit, insufficient data).Research: The author stated that further prospective studies should be conducted to assess whether vasopressin is more effective than epinephrine for asystolic cardiac arrest, and to assess it in combination with epinephrine for refractory cardiac arrest.","Pellegrino, Anthony M",Emerg.

The persuasive effects of message framing in organ donation: The mediating role of psychological reactance,"The effects of message framing on reactions to campaign messages promoting organ donation were examined in three experiments. It was predicted that gain-framed messages would produce more positive reactions toward organ and tissue donation. In Study 1, students (N=189) responded to either a gain-framed or loss-framed message about organ donation. Study 2 (N=318) and Study 3 (N=433) examined the role of psychological reactance as a mediator between framing and reactions. Results indicated an effect for framing across the three studies - specifically, students reading a gain-framed message reported more favorable reactions toward the scripted message and lower psychological reactance. Psychological reactance and perceived manipulative intent were found to mediate the relationship between framing and message reactions.","Reinhart, A.M.; Marshall, H.M.; Feeley, T.H.; Tutzauer, F.",Commun.

Systematic review: kidney transplantation compared with dialysis in clinically relevant outcomes,"The findings validated attempts to increase the number of people worldwide who benefit from kidney transplantation. XCM: Inclusion criteria for the review were broadly defined and several relevant data sources were searched. Sixty-one articles were excluded on the basis of language, which may have introduced language bias. Publication bias was not assessed and could not be ruled out. Attempts were made to reduce reviewer error and bias throughout the review process. Quality assessment indicated that the risk of bias in the included studies was variable. The studies differed in terms of patient and study characteristics, so a narrative synthesis was presented. The review had potential for a number of biases, which limits the reliability of the authors’ conclusions. The call for further research appears warranted. XIM: Practice: The authors stated that there was an urgent need to increase living and deceased kidney donation. Research: The authors stated that future studies should identify patient-level factors associated with the benefit of transplantation for outcomes other than mortality. For cardiovascular events and all-cause hospitalisation this could be achieved by patient-level meta-analysis. Other outcomes such as quality of life would need detailed prospective study. Statistical adjustment for potential confounders would be critical for the success of such initiatives and so there was a need for consensus on the best way to measure and adjust for comorbidity after wait-listing for transplantation.","Tonelli, M; Wiebe, N; Knoll, G; Bello, A; Browne, S; Jadhav, D; Klarenbach, S; Gill, J",,143
Generosity's antecedents and outcomes - A proposed relationship between Generosity and Intention in Indonesia's BPJS Kesehatan,"In one preliminary descriptive study, the authors look for the satisfaction of and intention towards BPJS Kesehatan in Indonesia, revealing that despite the high un-satisfaction rate, ninety-one per cent of members are still expressing their intention continue paying insurance premium. The most mentioned reason for continued membership is helping others. Therefore, the preliminary study concludes that there might be a role of generosity influencing intention. This study aims to develop a conceptual model linking generosity to intention. The method used for critical review is PRISMA systematic review. The result of the critical review is used as the based for concept development. More than three hundred publications published after 2007 in Science Direct were screened with key words ""generosity"" and ""charity"". Finally, thirty journals were included in this review. The finding is that the most discussed topics are terminology (3 journals), motivation (16 journals), consequences (5 journals), and attributes of generosity (5 journals). Based on the review results, two possible relationships between generosity and intention are proposed. The first is that generosity, mediated by positive emotion, will influence intention. The second is that generosity has a direct influence on intention. It concludes with the need for further study to find empirical validation of the two possible relationships between generosity and intention. This is the first study proposed to link the generosity to intention.","Dwidienawati, D; Abdinagoro, S B",Journal of Business and Retail Management Research,144
Numeracy as a precursor to pro-social behavior: The impact of numeracy and presentation format on the cognitive mechanisms underlying donation decisions,"Donation requests often convey numerical information about the people in need. In two studies we investigated the effects of numeracy and presentation format on the underlying affective and cognitive mechanisms of donation decisions. In Study 1, participants were presented with information about a victim in need, either in a frequency format or in a percentage format. In Study 2, we manipulated the identifiability and number of target victims. Our results demonstrate that donations of individuals lower in numeracy were more susceptible to changes in numeric presentation format than those higher in numeracy. Importantly, the underlying mechanisms for donations differed by numeracy. Whereas the mental image of the victim influenced donation decisions of less numerate people only, the estimated impact of a donation was positively correlated with donation amounts for both more and less numerate individuals.","Dickert, S.; Kleber, J.; Peters, E.; Slovic, P.",Judgm.

The effect of context on moral intensity of ethical issues: Revising Jones's issue-contingent model,"Jones's (1991) issue-contingent model of ethical decision making posits that six dimensions of moral intensity influence decision makers' recognition of an issue as a moral problem and subsequent behavior. He notes that ""organizational settings present special challenges to moral agents"" (1991, p. 390) and that organizational factors affect ""moral decision making and behavior at two points: establishing moral intent and engaging in moral behavior"" (1991, p. 391). This model, however, minimizes both the impact of organizational setting and organizational factors on these experiences of ethical issues. In this theory, context is modeled as affecting the moral intent and behavior of the actor rather than directly affecting the issue's moral intensity. Here we look specifically at the effect of context on the moral intensity of ethical issues through a phenomenological study. Our results indicate that in certain environments, context may be critical in affecting the moral intensity of ethical issues. Thus, researchers should consider it more fully when assessing these issues' moral intensity.","Kelley, P.C.; Elm, D.R.",J. Bus. Ethics,147
Moderated Commitment: Members’ Decisions Not to Give to Professional Associations,"Workers pay membership dues to professional associations, which mark their identification with a particular field. Professional associations invite additional voluntary contributions for new or expanded programs, but most members do not make these additional gifts. We advance and test a conceptual model of the forces that might interrupt an otherwise committed or engaged member’s decision to make such a voluntary contribution. We conclude that giving decisions can be displaced by member beliefs that their dues and fees are sufficient or that their disposable income is committed to other obligations. We also conclude that giving decisions intersect with weak association strategy, such as a failure to solicit gifts in ways that are informative or useful to prospective donors. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Hung, C.; Hager, M.A.",Public Perform.

Social loafing in the management of social dilemmas,"A social dilemma is a situation in which people are confronted with a choice between acting for the group good or for selfish gain, and outcomes are determined in part by own choice and in part by what others do. Personal outcomes are always better when one acts selfishly than for the collective and the maximum personal outcome is received when one acts selfishly and all others act for the group. However, outcomes when everyone acts for themselves are worse than when everyone acts collectively. It is thus to the benefit of everyone to forgo selfish interests in favor of collective interests. Social dilemmas are prevalent in society. Examples include clean air and management of groundwater. Considerable evidence shows that, left to their own devices, people tend to gravitate toward selfishness, and decades of research has been directed toward identifying techniques to increase collective action. Selfishness can be seen as a form of social loafing, in that the actor is letting others do the work and hoping to benefit from their efforts. In this chapter, we will analyze selfishness from a social loafing perspective and review how social loafing theory can enhance our understanding of cooperation and how to promote it. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

THEORY TESTING: COMBINING PSYCHOMETRIC META‐ANALYSIS AND STRUCTURAL EQUATIONS MODELING,"This paper presents an overview of a useful approach for theory testing in the social sciences that combines the principles of psychometric meta‐analysis and structural equations modeling. In this approach to theory testing, the estimated true score correlations between the constructs of interest are established through the application of meta‐analysis (Hunter & Schmidt, 1990), and structural equations modeling is then applied to the matrix of estimated true score correlations. The potential advantages and limitations of this approach are presented. The approach enables researchers to test complex theories involving several constructs that cannot all be measured in a single study. Decision points are identified, the options available to a researcher are enumerated, and the potential problems as well as the prospects of each are discussed. Copyright © 1995, Wiley Blackwell.

Beyond social facilitation: A review of the far-reaching effects of social attention,"Social psychology has demonstrated that people behave differently in social attention, compared to when alone. First and foremost, being in social attention affects people's performance and their interpersonal behavior by increasing arousal and reputational concerns, respectively. However, newer work demonstrates more fundamental intra-psychological effects of social attention. As mere reminders of social attention can activate reputational concerns, people's thoughts and behavior are affected by such reminders even when people's reputation is not at stake. These findings provide a deeper look at more intra-personal effects of social attention. As a result, recent research focuses on how social attention fundamentally influences people's subjective perceptions and experiences. In this review, we provide an overview of the far-reaching effects of social attention, identify relevant moderators and mediators, discuss socio-motivational and cognitive processes underlying these effects, and highlight avenues for future research. © 2017 Guilford Publications, Inc.","Steinmetz, J.; Pfattheicher, S.",Soc.

"The Implementation of INA-CBGs System Impact on Financial Performance of Public Hospital, the Indonesia Case: A Systematic Review","Indonesia started the national health insurance system on 1 January 2014. In this system, there is only one insurer institution, BPJS Kesehatan, a social security agency established by the government to provide health insurance for Indonesian people. This new national health insurance system pays all claims based on package system called Indonesia Case-Based Groups (INA-CBGs). The aim of this review is to describe the application of the INA-CBGs system and its effect on financial performance of the public hospital and helping them in identifying and anticipating problems in implementation of the INA-CBGs system. This review shows prism flowchart using Proquest and Portal Garuda with INA-CBGs, public hospital finance performance, universal health coverage, and Indonesia as the keywords. From the 15 selection research journals, we found that the implementation of the INA-CBGs system with the prospective payment system can provide a positive impact on the financial performance in public hospital, when the hospital could reduce inefficient cost of treatment. Furthermore, public hospitals achieve a surplus since they receive a donation from the government for salary expenses and investment-related expenses. Public hospital management in Indonesia should consider the competence of their accounting and financial managers so they can manage their hospitals properly. Each public hospital management must have a strategy and innovation to improve the quality of service so they can compete with other hospitals and financial performance can be improved in this JKN era.","Happy, Anastasia",KnE Life Sciences,154

Decision-making in everyday moral conflict situations: Development and validation of a new measure,"In everyday life, we are often confronted with morally conflicting social interaction situations. Therefore, the main objective of the present set of studies was the development and validation of a new measure to assess decision-making in everyday moral conflict situations. All vignettes required a decision between an altruistic versus an egoistic behavioral response alternative. In three independent surveys (N = 200), we developed a 40-items measure with preferable mean rates of altruistic decisions (Study 1), clear representation of altruistic and egoistic response classes (Study 2), unambiguousness of social closeness classifications (socially close vs. socially distant protagonists; Studies 1 and 2), and high similarity to reality ratings (Studies 1 and 2). Additionally, we developed two parallelized item sets for future use in within-subjects design studies and investigated the measurement properties of our new scale (Studies 1 and 3). Results of Rasch model analyses and classical test theory fit indices showed unidimensionality and confirmed the appropriateness of the fragmentation into two parallelized item sets. Notably, in our data, there were neither effects of social closeness nor gender on the percentage of altruistic decisions. In sum, we propose the Everyday Moral Conflict Situations (EMCS) Scale as a promising new measurement tool that may facilitate further research in different research areas due to its broad applicability. © 2019 Singer et al.

Gender differences in empathic responses to others’ economic payoffs: an event-related potentials study,"Although gender differences in empathy have been well established through measuring subjective outcomes, some studies of the neural mechanisms of pain empathy have not found gender differences. This inconsistent evidence may be caused by different research methods or different paradigms. The present study adopted a different approach from the pain empathy paradigm to examine gender differences in empathic responses to others’ economic payoffs using event-related potentials. The results showed that the N2 amplitudes in female participants were more negative than those in male participants, indicating a greater female than male susceptibility to facial expressions at the early stage of empathy. The LPP amplitudes for male participants were found to be more positive in the observation condition (involving no self-interest) than in the participation condition (involving self-interest), but there was no significant difference in the LPP amplitudes for the female participants between the two conditions. The results suggest that females’ empathic responses are more likely to be elicited automatically by the perception of others’ emotional states. In contrast, males’ empathic responses are more likely to be mediated by self-interest, which subsequently reduces their empathic responses. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Jie, J.; Luo, P.; Zhuang, M.; Fan, M.; Wang, Y.; Yang, Y.; Zheng, X.",Exp.

"Violent Video Game Effects on Aggression, Empathy, and Prosocial Behavior in Eastern and Western Countries: A Meta-Analytic Review","Meta-analytic procedures were used to test the effects of violent video games on aggressive behavior, aggressive cognition, aggressive affect, physiological arousal, empathy/desensitization, and prosocial behavior. Unique features of this meta-analytic review include (a) more restrictive methodological quality inclusion criteria than in past meta-analyses; (b) cross-cultural comparisons; (c) longitudinal studies for all outcomes except physiological arousal; (d) conservative statistical controls; (e) multiple moderator analyses; and (f) sensitivity analyses. Social-cognitive models and cultural differences between Japan and Western countries were used to generate theory-based predictions. Meta-analyses yielded significant effects for all 6 outcome variables. The pattern of results for different outcomes and research designs (experimental, cross-sectional, longitudinal) fit theoretical predictions well. The evidence strongly suggests that exposure to violent video games is a causal risk factor for increased aggressive behavior, aggressive cognition, and aggressive affect and for decreased empathy and prosocial behavior. Moderator analyses revealed significant research design effects, weak evidence of cultural differences in susceptibility and type of measurement effects, and no evidence of sex differences in susceptibility. Results of various sensitivity analyses revealed these effects to be robust, with little evidence of selection (publication) bias. © 2010 American Psychological Association.","Anderson, C.A.; Shibuya, A.; Ihori, N.; Swing, E.L.; Bushman, B.J.; Sakamoto, A.; Rothstein, H.R.; Saleem, M.",Psychol.

Development of a New Outlier Statistic for Meta-Analytic Data,"This article describes the development of a new technique for identifying outlier coefficients in meta-analytic data sets. Denoted as the sample-adjusted meta-analytic deviancy statistic or SAMD, this technique takes into account the sample size on which each study is based when determining outlier status. An empirical test of the SAMD statistic with an actual meta-analytic data set resulted in a substantial reduction in residual variabilities and a corresponding increase in the percentage of variance accounted for by statistical artifacts after removal of outlier study coefficients. Moreover, removal of these coefficients helped to clarify what was a confusing and difficult-to-explain finding in this meta-analysis. It is suggested that analysis for outliers become a routine part of meta-analysis methodology.

Spinal Decerebrate-Like Posturing After Brain Death: A Case Report and Review of the Literature,"INTRODUCTION: Criteria for establishing brain death (BD) require absence of all brainstem-mediated reflexes including motor (ie, decerebrate or decorticate) posturing. A number of spinal cord automatisms may emerge after BD, but occurrence of decerebrate-like spinal reflexes may be particularly problematic; confusion of such stereotypic extension-pronation movements with brain stem reflexes may confound or delay definitive diagnosis of BD. We present a case in which we verified the noncerebral (ie, likely spinal) origin of such decerebrate-like reflexes. METHODS: Case report and systematic review of literature. RESULTS: A 63-year-old woman presented with large pontine hemorrhage and complete loss of cerebral function, including no motor response to pain. Apnea testing confirmed death by neurologic criteria. Thirty-six hours after BD declaration, during assessment for organ donation, she began to exhibit spontaneous and stimulus-induced stereotypic extension-pronation of the upper extremities. The similarity of these movements to decerebrate posturing prompted concern for retained brain stem function, but repeat neurological examination of cranial nerves and apnea testing did not reveal any cerebral responses. Electrocerebral silence on electroencephalogram and absent perfusion on nuclear medicine brain imaging further confirmed BD. Review of PubMed yielded 5 additional case reports and 4 cohorts describing cases of decerebrate-like extension-pronation movements presenting in a delayed fashion after BD. CONCLUSION: Extension-pronation movements that mimic decerebrate posturing may be seen in a delayed fashion after BD. Verification of lack of any brain activity (by both examination and multiple ancillary tests) in this case and others prompts us to attribute these movements as spinal cord reflexes and propose they be recognized within the rubric of accepted post-BD automatisms that should not delay diagnosis or necessitate confirmatory testing.","Kumar, Abhay; Tummala, Pavan; Feen, Eliahu S; Dhar, Rajat",J.

Taxes and voluntary contributions: Evidence from state tax form check-off programs,"This paper analyzes taxpayer contributions to state check-off funds using four years of Kentucky household income tax data. An ordered probit shows that a taxpayer tends to give to more check-off funds as income increases and tax price of contribution decreases. A Heckman selection model shows that the Nature Fund and Child Fund are normal goods, with income elasticities of contribution of 0.20 and 0.14. With values of -0.58 and -0.29, the tax price elasticities of contribution are even greater. If refund amount is included, elasticities become smaller; the refund elastici! ties of contribution are 0.08 and 0.06, respectively.","Newsome, M.A.; Blomquist, G.C.; Romain, W.S.",Natl. Tax J.,163
Attitudes and the Prediction of Behavior: A Meta-Analysis of the Empirical Literature,"The relationship between attitudes and behavior has been the topic of considerable debate. This article reports a meta-analysis of 88 attitude-behavior studies that reveals that attitudes significantly and substantially predict future behavior (mean r = .38; combined p <<. 000000000001). Relatively large and significant moderating effects were found for the attitudinal variables of attitude certainty, stability, accessibility, affective-cognitive consistency, and direct experience (mean q = .39). A smaller but significant moderating effect was found for self-monitoring (mean q = .29). Methodological factors associated with high attitude-behavior correlations included self-report measures of behavior (q =. 22), the use of nonstudents as subjects (q =. 17), and corresponding levels of specificity in the attitude and behavior measures (mean q = .47). The practical magnitude of attitude-behavior correlations is considered, as are the future directions of attitude-behavior research.","Kraus, Stephen J",Pers. Soc. Psychol. Bull.,164
"Relationships Among Attitudes, Behavioral Intentions, and Behavior: A Meta-Analysis of Past Research, Part 2","In a recent meta-analysis of attitude-behavior research, the authors of this article found a strong overall attitude-behavior relationship (r = .79) when methodological artifacts are eliminated. The trend in A-B research, however, is to conceive of behavioral intentions (BI) as a mediator between attitudes (A) and behaviors (B). In this study, it is hypothesized that (a) A-BI correlation would be higher than A-B correlation, (b) BI-B correlation would be higher than A-B correlation, (c) A-BI correlation would be higher than BI-B correlation, (d) the variation in BI-B correlations would be greater than that of A-BI, and (e) attitudinal relevance would affect the magnitude of the A-BI correlation. A series of meta-analyses, integrating the findings of 92 A-BI correlations (N = 16,785) and 47 B-BI correlations (N = 10,203) that deal with 19 specified categories and a variety of miscellaneous topics was performed. The results were consistent with all five hypotheses. The theoretical and methodological implications are discussed.","Kim, Min-Sun; Hunter, John E",Communic. Res.,165
Are social value orientations expressed automatically? decision making in the dictator game,"Drawing on the social intuitionist model, the authors studied the hypothesis that social value orientations are expressed automatically in behavior. They compared spontaneous and more deliberated decisions in the dictator game and confirmed that social values determine behavior when responses are based on the automatic system. By means of both mediation and experimental analyses, the authors further demonstrate that the automatic expression of social value orientations is mediated by perceptions of interpersonal closeness. A reasoning process can subsequently override these automatic responses and disconnect decisions from perceptions of interpersonal closeness. This results in lower levels of other-regarding behavior, at least for prosocials. © 2011 by the Society for Personalityand Social Psychology, Inc.","Cornelissen, G.; Dewitte, S.; Warlop, L.",Pers.

A cross-cultural analysis of the behavior of women and men: Implications for the origins of sex differences,"This article evaluates theories of the origins of sex differences in human behavior. It reviews the cross-cultural evidence on the behavior of women and men in nonindustrial societies, especially the activities that contribute to the sex-typed division of labor and patriarchy. To explain the cross-cultural findings, the authors consider social constructionism, evolutionary psychology, and their own biosocial theory. Supporting the biosocial analysis, sex differences derive from the interaction between the physical specialization of the sexes, especially female reproductive capacity, and the economic and social structural aspects of societies. This biosocial approach treats the psychological attributes of women and men as emergent given the evolved characteristics of the sexes, their developmental experiences, and their situated activity in society.","Wood, W.; Eagly, A.H.",Psychol.

Commercialization and nonprofit donations: A meta-analytic assessment and extension,"Commercialization is a primary interest within the nonprofit sector. Previous studies have investigated the relationship between commercialization and nonprofit donations in a wide variety of contexts. This meta-analysis synthesizes the research on the relationship by using 295 effects from 25 primary studies and explains variations in effects within and across the studies by including a series of moderators in random-effects meta-regression models. The results indicate that commercialization crowds out donations. The crowding-out effect is small. Moreover, the results indicate that mission-driven commercial revenues return a more negative effect; international development and public benefit nonprofits return a more negative effect; and studies using longitudinal data demonstrate a more positive effect. This study suggests that nonprofit commercialization is more a question of how rather than whether. Devoting more scholarly attention to underlying mechanisms between commercial revenues and nonprofit donations is desirable. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC","Hung, C.",Nonprofit Manage. Leadersh.,171

The empirical case for two systems of reasoning,"Distinctions have been proposed between systems of reasoning for centuries. This article distills properties shared by many of these distinctions and characterizes the resulting systems in light of recent findings and theoretical developments. One system is associative because its computations reflect similarity structure and relations of temporal contiguity. The other is ""rule based"" because it operates on symbolic structures that have logical content and variables and because its computations have the properties that are normally assigned to rules. The systems serve complementary functions and can simultaneously generate different solutions to a reasoning problem. The rule-based system can suppress the associative system but not completely inhibit it. The article reviews evidence in favor of the distinction and its characterization. © 1996 by the American Psychological Association.","Sloman, S.A.",Psychol. Bull.,174

"Long-Term Relations Among Prosocial-Media Use, Empathy, and Prosocial Behavior","Despite recent growth of research on the effects of prosocial media, processes underlying these effects are not well understood. Two studies explored theoretically relevant mediators and moderators of the effects of prosocial media on helping. Study 1 examined associations among prosocial- and violent-media use, empathy, and helping in samples from seven countries. Prosocial-media use was positively associated with helping. This effect was mediated by empathy and was similar across cultures. Study 2 explored longitudinal relations among prosocial-video-game use, violent-video-game use, empathy, and helping in a large sample of Singaporean children and adolescents measured three times across 2 years. Path analyses showed significant longitudinal effects of prosocial- and violent-video-game use on prosocial behavior through empathy. Latent-growth-curve modeling for the 2-year period revealed that change in video-game use significantly affected change in helping, and that this relationship was mediated by change in empathy. © The Author(s) 2013.","Prot, S.; Gentile, D.A.; Anderson, C.A.; Suzuki, K.; Swing, E.; Lim, K.M.; Horiuchi, Y.; Jelic, M.; Krahé, B.; Liuqing, W.; Liau, A.K.; Khoo, A.; Petrescu, P.D.; Sakamoto, A.; Tajima, S.; Toma, R.A.; Warburton, W.; Zhang, X.; Lam, B.C.P.",Psychol.

An analysis of renewable mini-grid projects for rural electrification,"Almost 900 million people are living with no access to electricity, mostly in remote regions where extending the central grid is infeasible. These remote communities often heavily depend on expensive and polluting diesel generators that create significant financial and operational challenges. Following the recent advances and cost reductions in renewable technologies, governments, private sector, and non-profit organizations started investing in rural electrification projects through renewable mini-grids, some of which were reported to have been unsuccessful. The findings and the lessons learned from these projects remain highly compartmentalized across different studies, making it significantly challenging to derive evidence-based insights on clean rural electrification for investors and practitioners. This study aids in closing this gap by collecting project-level data on 104 renewable energy mini-grids installed across the globe. We first conduct a systematic review of these projects to derive qualitative insights on drivers of project success and the benefits to communities. Next, we empirically validate some of our qualitative findings and identify the factors contributing to mini-grid project success and cost. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Duran, A.S.; Sahinyazan, F.G.",Socio-Econ.

Subliminal influence on generosity,"We experimentally subliminally prime subjects prior to charity donation decisions by showing words that have connotations of pro-social values for a very brief time (17 ms). Our main finding is that, compared to a baseline condition, the pro-social prime increases donations by approximately 10–17 % among subjects with strong pro-social preferences (universalism values). We find a similar effect when interacting the prime with the Big 5 personality characteristic of agreeableness. We furthermore introduce a novel method for testing for priming, “subliminity”. This method reveals that some subjects are capable of recognizing prime words, and the overall results are weaker when we control for this capacity. © 2016, Economic Science Association.","Andersson, O.; Miettinen, T.; Hytönen, K.; Johannesson, M.; Stephan, U.",Exp.

The cost-effectiveness of prophylaxis with valaciclovir in the management of cytomegalovirus after renal transplantation,"Prophylaxis-based antiviral treatment and intensive monitoring followed by pre-emptive antiviral treatment are both commonly used management strategies to reduce risk of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection following renal transplantation. This study employed a decision-model approach using published efficacy data and information from a recent survey of French clinical practice to consider the relative costs and outcomes associated with CMV prevention strategies for high-risk patient groups. The cost per case of treating tissue invasive and symptomatic CMV disease was estimated at euro 15,431 and euro 10,852, respectively. In the highest infection-risk patient group (positive donor with no previous CMV history) prophylactic oral valaciclovir was shown to avoid the greatest number of CMV disease cases (35 cases per 100 transplanted patients) and reduced the overall CMV-related costs per transplanted patient by around 14% over a'wait-and-treat' baseline strategy. In contrast, intensive monitoring and preemptive treatment resulted in a much higher cost per transplanted patient. This analysis suggests that prophylactic treatment remains the most cost-effective approach to the management of CMV in renal-transplanted patients. Further comparative studies between prophylactic and pre-emptive treatment would be a valuable addition to the current evidence based on CMV prevention.","Legendre, Christophe; Beard, Stephen M; Crochard, Anne; Lebranchu, Yvon; Pouteil-Noble, Claire; Richter, Anke; Durand-Zaleski, Isabelle",Eur.

In control condition the donation solicitation was formulated directly. In all the cases, the request was manipulated by the order of the successive HTML pages of the site. Results show that the DITF procedure increase compliance to the last request.

Meta-analysis: risk for hypertension in living kidney donors,"BACKGROUND: The risk for hypertension after kidney donation remains uncertain. PURPOSE: To see whether normotensive adults who donate a kidney develop higher blood pressure and risk for hypertension compared with nondonor adults acting as control participants. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Science Citation Index were searched from 1966 until November 2005 for articles published in any language. Reference lists of pertinent articles were also reviewed. STUDY SELECTION: The authors selected studies involving 10 or more healthy normotensive adults who donated a kidney and in whom blood pressure was assessed at least 1 year later. DATA EXTRACTION: Two reviewers independently abstracted data on study and donor characteristics, blood pressure measurements, outcomes, and prognostic features. Comparison data were abstracted from donor studies with control participants. Thirty primary authors provided additional data. DATA SYNTHESIS: Forty-eight studies from 28 countries followed a total of 5145 donors. Before surgery, the average age of donors was 41 years, the average systolic blood pressure was 121 mm Hg, and the average diastolic blood pressure was 77 mm Hg for all studies. In controlled studies in which the average follow-up was at least 5 years after donation (range, 6 to 13 years), blood pressure was 5 mm Hg higher in donors than in control participants (the weighted mean for systolic blood pressure using 4 studies involving 157 donors and 128 control participants was 6 mm Hg [95% CI, 2 to 11 mm Hg], and the weighted mean for diastolic blood pressure using 5 studies involving 196 donors and 161 control participants was 4 mm Hg [CI, 1 to 7 mm Hg]). There was statistical heterogeneity among the 6 controlled studies that assessed hypertension; an increase in risk was noted in 1 study (relative risk, 1.9 [CI, 1.1 to 3.5]). LIMITATIONS: Most studies were retrospective and did not include control groups that were assembled and followed along with donors. Approximately one third of the donors had incomplete follow-up information. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of the limited studies conducted to date, kidney donors may have a 5-mm Hg increase in blood pressure within 5 to 10 years after donation over that anticipated with normal aging. Future controlled, prospective studies with long periods of follow-up will better delineate safety and identify donors at lowest risk for long-term morbidity.","Boudville, Neil; Prasad, G V Ramesh; Knoll, Greg; Muirhead, Norman; Thiessen-Philbrook, Heather; Yang, Robert C; Rosas-Arellano, M Patricia; Housawi, Abdulrahman; Garg, Amit X; Donor Nephrectomy Outcomes Research (DONOR) Network",Ann.

Prosocial and moral behavior under decision reveal in a public environment,"People may act differently in public environments due to actual reputation concerns, or due to the mere presence of others. Unlike previous studies on the influence of observability on prosocial behavior we control for the latter while manipulating the former, i.e. we control for implicit reputation concerns while manipulating explicit. We show that revealing decisions in public did not affect altruistic behavior, while it increased cooperation and made subjects less likely to make utilitarian judgments in sacrificial dilemmas (i.e., harming one to save many). Our findings are in line with theoretical models suggesting that people, at large, are averse to standing out in both positive and negative ways when it comes to altruistic giving. This “wallflower effect” does however not seem to extend to decisions on cooperation and moral judgments made in public. © 2020 The Authors","Andersson, P.A.; Erlandsson, A.; Västfjäll, D.; Tinghög, G.",J.

Factors Affecting the Effectiveness of Cause-Related Marketing: A Meta-Analysis,"In its three decades of development, many constructs of cause-related marketing have been tested from different perspectives and in varied contexts. However, there has not yet been an integrated empirical study. Reviewing 162 studies from 117 articles, we constructed a framework of meta-analysis and identified 20 constructs. Among these, 13 are antecedents that can be grouped into three components: consumer-related traits, execution-related factors, and product-related traits, while three mediators and four consequences are used to measure the effectiveness of cause-related marketing. Moreover, we examined 857 relationships among the constructs. The results showed that consumer-related traits, execution-related factors, and product-related traits all influence the effectiveness of cause-related marketing to varying degrees. Furthermore, we analyzed the effects of six moderators and found that cause-related marketing would be more effective when the brand is familiar, the product is utilitarian, the donation magnitude is large, and the cause is less familiar. However, neither cultural orientation nor cause type significantly influences the effectiveness of cause-related marketing. Finally, the interactions between these moderators and execution-related antecedents provide contributions and implications for cause-related marketing. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Fan, X.; Deng, N.; Qian, Y.; Dong, X.",J.

"Proteinuria and reduced kidney function in living kidney donors: a systematic review, meta-analysis, and meta-regression","Live kidney donation is safe. However, it associated with small increases in urinary protein, which become more pronounced over time. It is also associated with an initial decrement in GFR, but this does not become more pronounced over time beyond changes associated with normal ageing. XCM: This review addressed a clear objective with defined inclusion criteria. Several relevant sources and strategies were used in the literature search, the quality of the included studies was assessed in detail, and adequate steps were taken to minimise potential error and bias during the review process. Suitable meta-analytic techniques appear to have been used to pool the main results, and heterogeneity was assessed and (where present) investigated. Sensitivity analyses were used to investigate the effect of review methodology. Although the review was limited by the poor quality of the primary studies, the authors' conclusions appear well supported by the data. XIM: Practice: The authors stated that live kidney donation is safe but that donors should have their serum creatinine clearance and urine protein screened annually for life, until the implications of low-grade proteinuria or reduced GFR in some donors is better understood. All donors should be advised about the prevention of future renal and cardiovascular disease. Research: The authors stated that a large prospective multicentre cohort study with long-term follow-up is needed, with representative numbers of donors and appropriate controls followed for extended periods. A diverse range of participants should be included to ascertain the differential effects of donation in different groups, and definitive outcomes such as death and cardiovascular disease should be measured.","Garg, A X; Muirhead, N; Knoll, G; Yang, R C; Prasad, G V; Thiessen-Philbrook, H; Rosas-Arellano, M P; Housawi, A; Boudville, N",,189

Potential cost-effectiveness of maternal and infant antiretroviral interventions to prevent mother-to-child transmission during breast-feeding,"INTRODUCTION: One-third of maternal-to-child HIV transmission occurs during breast-feeding (BF). Several trials are currently evaluating the efficacy of postpartum antiretrovirals to reduce BF transmission. METHODS: This study used Markov modeling to define the circumstances under which the following interventions would be cost-effective: BF for 6 months with daily infant nevirapine (NVP) prophylaxis; maternal combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) during pregnancy and for 6 months of BF; and maternal combination ART only for women who meet CD4 criteria. Each was compared to: BF for 12 months; BF for 6 months; and formula feeding for 12 months. Strategies were evaluated for a hypothetical cohort of 40,000 pregnant women in sub-Saharan Africa, in the context of available voluntary counseling and testing in antenatal care. Model estimates were derived from the literature and local sources. Sensitivity analyses were performed on uncertain estimates. The perspective used was that of a government health district. RESULTS: Using base case estimates, BF for 6 months was the economically preferred strategy: it cost 806,995 dollars and generated 446,208 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Providing daily infant NVP cost an additional 93,638 dollars and generated 1183 additional QALYs, but its incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 79 dollars/QALY exceeded the standard willingness to pay (64 dollars/QALY) for most resource-poor settings. Maternal combination ART was potentially very effective but too costly for most resource-poor settings (ICER: 87 dollars/QALY). In order for daily infant NVP during BF to be preferred, it must have >/=44% relative efficacy or cost </=5.00 dollars/mo. If NVP were donated, it would only have to be minimally effective to be the economically preferred strategy. If ART cost </=34.50 dollars/mo, ART to all mothers would become the preferred strategy under our assumption of 82% efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: Providing antiretrovirals during BF represents a promising alternative, should their effectiveness, and feasibility be proven.","Maclean, Courtney C; Stringer, Jeffrey S A",J. Acquir.

The impact of CEO compensation on nonprofit donations,"In this paper we show that supporters reduce donations to nonprofits subsequent to disclosure of high executive compensation. We find evidence consistent with large, sophisticated donors actively seeking out and reacting to compensation information made available in IRS Form 990, while smaller donors react to compensation disclosures in the media. Additional analysis indicates that these results vary systematically across nonprofits, as we find a stronger negative relation in nonprofits classified as more charitable, and a weaker relation in nonprofits that provide services to their donors. In contrast neither grantors nor patrons appear to react to executive compensation disclosures.","Balsam, S.; Harris, E.E.",Account. Rev.,192

Do donors discount low-quality accounting information?,"Prior research finds that donors reward nonprofits that report larger program ratios with more donations and that program ratios frequently are subject to intentional manipulation as well as unintentional errors. We examine how donors react to low-quality ratios. We find that the average donor discounts ratios that are inflated by only the simplest and most observable of methods. We then examine the effect of financial data availability on the average donor's ability to unravel inflated ratios by using the historical shift in data availability that occurred in 1997 and 1998. We find that donors began to discount ratios only after 1998. Finally, we examine whether the discount applied to program ratios varies across donor sophistication (measured as the percentage of fund balances with restrictions) and find that sophisticated donors apply incrementally larger discounts to inflated ratios and discount ratios that are inflated by more complex methods. © 2013 American Accounting Association.","Yetman, M.H.; Yetman, R.J.",Account.

Short-term and long-term effects of violent media on aggression in children and adults,"Objectives: To test whether the results of the accumulated studies on media violence and aggressive behavior are consistent with the theories that have evolved to explain the effects. We tested for the existence of both short-term and long-term effects for aggressive behavior. We also tested the theory-driven hypothesis that short-term effects should be greater for adults and long-term effects should be greater for children. Design: Meta-analysis. Participants: Children younger than 18 years and adults. Main Exposures: Violent media, including TV, movies, video games, music, and comic books. Main Outcome Measures: Measures of aggressive behavior, aggressive thoughts, angry feelings, physiological arousal (eg, heart rate, blood pressure), and helping behavior. Results: Effect size estimates were combined using meta-analytic procedures. As expected, the short-term effects of violent media were greater for adults than for children whereas the long-term effects were greater for children than for adults. The results also showed that there were overall modest but significant effect sizes for exposure to media violence on aggressive behaviors, aggressive thoughts, angry feelings, arousal levels, and helping behavior. Conclusions: The results are consistent with the theory that short-term effects are mostly due to the priming of existing well-encoded scripts, schemas, or beliefs, which adults have had more time to encode. In contrast, long-term effects require the learning (encoding) of scripts, schemas, or beliefs. Children can encode new scripts, schemas, and beliefs via observational learning with less interference and effort than adults. ©2006 American Medical Association.

Acamprosate for alcohol dependence,"BACKGROUND: Alcohol dependence is among the main leading health risk factors in most developed and developing countries. Therapeutic success of psychosocial programs for relapse prevention is moderate, but could potentially be increased by an adjuvant treatment with the glutamate antagonist acamprosate. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effectiveness and tolerability of acamprosate in comparison to placebo and other pharmacological agents. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Group (CDAG) Specialized Register, PubMed, EMBASE and CINAHL in January 2009 and inquired manufacturers and researchers for unpublished trials. SELECTION CRITERIA: All double-blind randomised controlled trials (RCTs) which compare the effects of acamprosate with placebo or active control on drinking-related outcomes. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently extracted data. Trial quality was assessed by one author and cross-checked by a second author. Individual patient data (IPD) meta-analyses were used to verify the primary effectiveness outcomes. MAIN RESULTS: 24 RCTs with 6915 participants fulfilled the criteria of inclusion and were included in the review. Compared to placebo, acamprosate was shown to significantly reduce the risk of any drinking RR 0.86 (95% CI 0.81 to 0.91); NNT 9.09 (95% CI 6.66 to 14.28) and to significantly increase the cumulative abstinence duration MD 10.94 (95% CI 5.08 to 16.81), while secondary outcomes (gamma-glutamyltransferase, heavy drinking) did not reach statistical significance. Diarrhea was the only side effect that was more frequently reported under acamprosate than placebo RD 0.11 (95% 0.09 to 0.13); NNTB 9.09 (95% CI 7.69 to 11.11). Effects of industry-sponsored trials RR 0.88 (95% 0.80 to 0.97) did not significantly differ from those of non-profit funded trials RR 0.88 (95% CI 0.81 to 0.96). In addition, the linear regression test did not indicate a significant risk of publication bias (p = 0.861). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Acamprosate appears to be an effective and safe treatment strategy for supporting continuous abstinence after detoxification in alcohol dependent patients. Even though the sizes of treatment effects appear to be rather moderate in their magnitude, they should be valued against the background of the relapsing nature of alcoholism and the limited therapeutic options currently available for its treatment.","Rösner, Susanne; Hackl-Herrwerth, Andrea; Leucht, Stefan; Lehert, Philippe; Vecchi, Simona; Soyka, Michael",Cochrane Database Syst.

Trim and fill: A simple funnel-plot-based method of testing and adjusting for publication bias in meta-analysis,"We study recently developed nonparametric methods for estimating the number of missing studies that might exist in a meta-analysis and the effect that these studies might have had on its outcome. These are simple rank-based data augmentation techniques, which formalize the use of funnel plots. We show that they provide effective and relatively powerful tests for evaluating the existence of such publication bias. After adjusting for missing studies, we find that the point estimate of the overall effect size is approximately correct and coverage of the effect size confidence intervals is substantially improved, in many cases recovering the nominal confidence levels entirely. We illustrate the trim and fill method on existing meta-analyses of studies in clinical trials and psychometrics.","Duval, S.; Tweedie, R.",Biometrics,197
Expanding the Affective and Normative Components of the Theory of Planned Behavior: A Meta-Analysis of Anticipated Affect and Moral Norms,"Meta-analysis was used to determine the predictive validity of anticipated affect and moral norms in the theory of planned behavior (TPB; Ajzen, 1991). Medium-to-large sample-weighted average correlations were obtained. Anticipated affect and moral norms increased the variance explained in intentions by 5% and 3%, respectively, controlling for TPB variables. Intention mediated the influence of both variables on behavior. Moderator analyses showed that younger samples and behaviors with a moral dimension were associated with stronger moral-norm/intention relations, and anticipated regret was associated with a stronger anticipated-affect/intention relation. The implications of the findings for the TPB are discussed.","Rivis, Amanda; Sheeran, Paschal; Armitage, Christopher J",J. Appl. Soc. Psychol.,198
Anonymity in the dictator game revisited,"Giving in the dictator game has often been interpreted as evidence of other-regarding preferences. We suspect that giving is determined by subjects' attempts to appear fair in the eyes of recipients and the experimenter. Therefore, we investigate behavior in the dictator game by using the randomized response technique to increase anonymity. Overall, 290 subjects participated in two experiments. The results demonstrate that the randomized response technique reduces giving to negligible amounts compared to the standard double blind condition. Thus, our results suggest that individuals closely follow egoistic motives in the dictator game when anonymity is convincingly implemented. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Franzen, A.; Pointner, S.",J. Econ.

Are proselfs more deceptive and hypocritical? Social image concerns in appearing fair,"Deception varies across individuals and social contexts. The present research explored how individual difference measured by social value orientations, and situations, affect deception in moral hypocrisy. In two experiments, participants made allocations between themselves and recipients with an opportunity to deceive recipients where recipients cannot reject their allocations. Experiment 1 demonstrated that proselfs were more deceptive and hypocritical than prosocials by lying to be apparently fair, especially when deception was unrevealed. Experiment 2 showed that proselfs were more concerned about social image in deception in moral hypocrisy than prosocials were. They decreased apparent fairness when deception was revealed and evaluated by a third-party reviewer and increased it when deception was evaluated but unrevealed. These results show that prosocials and proselfs differed in pursuing deception and moral hypocrisy social goals and provide implications for decreasing deception and moral hypocrisy. © 2018 Tang, Wang, Liang, Sinnott-Armstrong, Su and Liu.","Tang, H.; Wang, S.; Liang, Z.; Sinnott-Armstrong, W.; Su, S.; Liu, C.",Front.

Barriers to research in palliative care: A systematic literature review,"AbstractIntroductionResearch in palliative care (PC) is often regarded as challenging due to the vulnerability of the population and other peculiarities. We aim to systematically identify barriers to research in PC in the literature.MethodsThe electronic databases CINAHL, MEDLINE were searched for papers published in the last 25 years. Citations and then abstracts were screened for inclusion. Original papers were included on first-level analysis. On a second level reviews, reports, and position papers were analyzed. Papers containing a direct patient report were specifically analyzed. Barriers were categorized (ethical considerations, financial and time expenses, study design and methodology, human resources and politics) and results quantified.ResultsTwenty-one original papers and 65 other papers were included. Five studies involved patients directly, five were systematic reviews, three were study experiences, and seven were surveys or workshop reports. Most papers originated from UK, USA, or Norwegian Universities. Ethics and methods were the most often mentioned categories on both levels. Accrual, attrition, and gatekeeping were frequently named barriers. Complex invasive studies or possible side effects hinder patients? participation, as patients are often willing to participate for altruistic motivations.DiscussionBarriers to PC research are ethical concerns and methodological challenges. Possible strategies to overcome methodological barriers include international collaborative efforts to include more patients and improve study designs. Ethical barriers indicate the need for patient involvement in the research development process and tailoring research specifically to the PC population.","Blum, David; Inauen, Roman; Binswanger, Jacqueline; Strasser, Florian",Prog.

Proportion dominance: The generality and variability of favoring relative savings over absolute savings,"Four studies probe Ps' sensitivity to absolute and relative savings. In three studies, Ps read scenarios forcing a tradeoff of saving more lives (230 vs. 225) vs. saving a larger proportion of a population (225 ÷ 230 = 75% vs. 230 ÷ 920 = 25%). Ps' preferences were driven by both absolute and relative savings. Maximizing relative savings, called ""proportion dominance"" (PD), at the expense of absolute savings is non-normative, and most participants concur with this argument upon reflection (Studies 2 and 3). PD is related to individual differences, such that people scored as ""rational"" thinkers exhibited less PD than people scored as ""experiential"" thinkers (Studies 1 and 3). Finally, a fourth study extends these results, finding proportion dominance in other domains using a different paradigm. These four studies demonstrate both the generality (across domains and paradigms) and the variability (inter- and intra-individual) of proportion dominance. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Using beta coefficients to impute missing correlations in meta-analysis research: Reasons for caution,"Meta-analysis has become a well-accepted method for synthesizing empirical research about a given phenomenon. Many meta-analyses focus on synthesizing correlations across primary studies, but some primary studies do not report correlations. Peterson and Brown (2005) suggested that researchers could use standardized regression weights (i.e., beta coefficients) to impute missing correlations. Indeed, their beta estimation procedures (BEPs) have been used in meta-analyses in a wide variety of fields. In this study, the authors evaluated the accuracy of BEPs in meta-analysis. We first examined how use of BEPs might affect results from a published meta-analysis. We then developed a series of Monte Carlo simulations that systematically compared the use of existing correlations (that were not missing) to data sets that incorporated BEPs (that impute missing correlations from corresponding beta coefficients). These simulations estimated ρ (mean population correlation) and SDρ (true standard deviation) across a variety of meta-analytic conditions. Results from both the existing meta-analysis and the Monte Carlo simulations revealed that BEPs were associated with potentially large biases when estimating ρ and even larger biases when estimating SDρ. Using only existing correlations often substantially outperformed use of BEPs and virtually never performed worse than BEPs. Overall, the authors urge a return to the standard practice of using only existing correlations in meta-analysis. © 2018 American Psychological Association.","Roth, P.L.; Le, H.; Oh, I.-S.; Van Iddekinge, C.H.; Bobko, P.",J.

Neurobehavioral Mechanisms Supporting Trust and Reciprocity,"Trust and reciprocity are cornerstones of human nature, both at the levels of close interpersonal relationships and economic/societal structures. Being able to both place trust in others and decide whether to reciprocate trust placed in us is rooted in implicit and explicit processes that guide expectations of others, help reduce social uncertainty, and build relationships. This review will highlight neurobehavioral mechanisms supporting trust and reciprocity, through the lens of implicit and explicit social appraisal and learning processes. Significant consideration will be given to the neural underpinnings of these implicit and explicit processes, and special focus will center on the underlying neurocomputational mechanisms facilitating the integration of implicit and explicit signals supporting trust and reciprocity. Finally, this review will conclude with a discussion of how we can leverage findings regarding the neurobehavioral mechanisms supporting trust and reciprocity to better inform our understanding of mental health disorders characterized by social dysfunction. © Copyright © 2019 Fareri.","Fareri, D.S.",Front.

Living donor liver transplantation in children,"The evidence base for LDLT is incomplete. There was limited evidence to suggest that LDLT is superior to all forms of cadaveric liver transplantation in children younger than 2 years. However, safety and efficacy in recipients older than 2 years suggest that LDLT is equivalent or worse than SLT and whole liver cadaveric transplantation. XCM: The review addressed a clear research question and the inclusion criteria were detailed for the participants, intervention, outcomes and study design. Several sources were searched for relevant published and unpublished studies, thus minimising publication bias. Details of the review process, including how the papers were selected for inclusion and how the data were extracted, were not reported; the possibility of reviewer error and bias could not, therefore, be assessed. Furthermore, the author did not appear to have assessed the quality of the included studies, so it was not possible to determine the validity of the studies on which the conclusions were based. Adequate details on each of the included studies were given and the presentation of results in a narrative was appropriate. The results were based on limited data from non-randomised controlled trials with non-comparable treatment groups, case series and registries. The author appropriately considered these limitations in the available evidence in her conclusions and recommendations. XIM: Practice: The author stated that, despite the limitations, LDLT is a life-saving procedure in some children where alternative options are not available. The programmes performing LDLT must adhere to an extremely high standard of care, which includes standard protocols for peri-operative evaluation of potential donors and post-operative follow-up of donors and recipients. In addition, psychosocial evaluation and support programmes should be considered.Research: The author did not state any implications for further research, although details of ongoing research were reported in the review.",Scott A,,208

Experimentally induced empathy has no impact on generosity in a monetarily incentivized Dictator game,"In a monetarily incentivized Dictator Game, we expected Dictators' empathy toward the Recipients to cause more pro-social allocations. Empathy was experimentally induced via a commonly used perspective taking task. Dictators (N = 474) were instructed to split an endowment of 10€ between themselves and an unknown Recipient. They could split the money 8/2 (8€ for Dictator, 2€ for Recipient) or 5/5 (5€ each). Although the empathy manipulation successfully increased Dictators' feelings of empathy toward the Recipients, Dictators' decisions on how to split the money were not affected. We had ample statistical power (above 0.99) to detect a typical social psychology effect (corresponding to r around 0.20). Other possible determinants of generosity in the Dictator Game should be investigated. © 2019 Lönnqvist and Walkowitz.","Lönnqvist, J.-E.; Walkowitz, G.",Front. Psychol.,210
Measuring delay discounting in a crowdsourced sample: An exploratory study,"Delay discounting is a measure of preferences for smaller immediate rewards over larger delayed rewards. Discounting has been assessed in many ways; these methods have variably and inconsistently involved measures of different lengths (single vs. multiple items), forced-choice methods, self-report methods, online and laboratory assessments, monetary and non-monetary compensation. The majority of these studies have been conducted in laboratory settings. However, over the past 20 years, behavioral data collection has increasingly shifted online. Usually, these experiments involve completing short tasks for small amounts of money, and are thus qualitatively different than experiments in the lab, which are typically more involved and in a strongly controlled environment. The present study aimed to determine how to best measure future discounting in a crowdsourced sample using three discounting measures (a single shot measure, the 27-item Kirby Monetary Choice Questionnaire, and a one-time Matching Task). We examined associations of these measures with theoretically related variables, and assessed influence of payment on responding. Results indicated that correlations between the discounting tasks and conceptually related measures were smaller than in prior laboratory experiments. Moreover, our results suggest providing monetary compensation may attenuate correlations between discounting measures and related variables. These findings suggest that incentivizing discounting measures changes the nature of measurement in these tasks. © 2019 Scandinavian Psychological Associations and John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Rotella, A.; Fogg, C.; Mishra, S.; Barclay, P.",Scand.

Status maximization as a source of fairness in a networked dictator game,"Human behavioural patterns exhibit selfish or competitive, as well as selfless or altruistic tendencies, both of which have demonstrable effects on human social and economic activity. In behavioural economics, such effects have traditionally been illustrated experimentally via simple games such as the dictator and the ultimatum games. Experiments with these games suggest that, beyond rational economic thinking, human decision-making processes are influenced by social preferences, such as an inclination to fairness. In this study, we suggest that the apparent gap between competitive and altruistic human tendencies can be bridged by assuming that people are primarily maximizing their status, i.e., a utility function different from simple profit maximization. To this end, we analyse a simple agent-based model, where individuals play the repeated dictator game in a social network they can modify. As model parameters, we consider the living costs and the rate at which agents forget infractions by others. We find that individual strategies used in the game vary greatly, from selfish to selfless, and that both of the above parameters determine when individuals form complex and cohesive social networks. © 2018 The authors.

Spontaneous giving and calculated greed,"Cooperation is central to human social behaviour. However, choosing to cooperate requires individuals to incur a personal cost to benefit others. Here we explore the cognitive basis of cooperative decision-making in humans using a dual-process framework. We ask whether people are predisposed towards selfishness, behaving cooperatively only through active self-control; or whether they are intuitively cooperative, with reflection and prospective reasoning favouring rational self-interest. To investigate this issue, we perform ten studies using economic games. We find that across a range of experimental designs, subjects who reach their decisions more quickly are more cooperative. Furthermore, forcing subjects to decide quickly increases contributions, whereas instructing them to reflect and forcing them to decide slowly decreases contributions. Finally, an induction that primes subjects to trust their intuitions increases contributions compared with an induction that promotes greater reflection. To explain these results, we propose that cooperation is intuitive because cooperative heuristics are developed in daily life where cooperation is typically advantageous. We then validate predictions generated by this proposed mechanism. Our results provide convergent evidence that intuition supports cooperation in social dilemmas, and that reflection can undermine these cooperative impulses. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

"Same behavior, different consequences: Reactions to men's and women's altruistic citizenship behavior","In 2 experimental studies, the authors hypothesized that the performance of altruistic citizenship behavior in a work setting would enhance the favorability of men's (but not women's) evaluations and recommendations, whereas the withholding of altruistic citizenship behavior would diminish the favorability of women's (but not men's) evaluations and recommendations. Results supported the authors' predictions. Together with the results of a 3rd study demonstrating that work-related altruism is thought to be less optional for women than for men, these results suggest that gender-stereotypic prescriptions regarding how men and women should behave result in different evaluative reactions to the same altruistic behavior, depending on the performer's sex.

Empirical results suggest that demand specification, data issues, and estimation methodology have varying degrees of influence on reported estimates of price, income, and advertising elasticities.

Mindfulness increases prosocial responses toward ostracized strangers through empathic concern,"Four studies tested the proposition that mindfulness and its training fostered prosociality toward ostracized strangers. In discovery Study 1, dispositional mindfulness predicted greater empathic concern for, and more helping behavior toward, an ostracized stranger. Using an experimental design, Study 2 revealed that very briefly instructed mindfulness, relative to active control instructions, also promoted prosocial responsiveness to an ostracized stranger. Study 3 ruled out alternative explanations for this effect of mindfulness, showing that it did not promote empathic anger or perpetrator punishment, nor that the control training reduced prosocial responsiveness toward an ostracized stranger rather than mindfulness increasing it. Study 4 further ruled out the alternative explanation of relaxation in the experimental effects of mindfulness. In all studies, empathic concern mediated the relation between mindfulness and one or both of the helping behavior outcomes. Meta-analyses of the four studies revealed stable, medium sized effects of mindfulness instruction on prosocial emotions and prosocial behavior. Together these findings inform about circumstances in which mindfulness may increase prosocial responsiveness, and deepen our understanding of the motivational bases of prosociality.

The Ultimatum Game and the brain: a meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies,"Social decision-making tasks involve psychological processes key to effective functioning in a complex, social world. The Ultimatum Game (UG) is a widely studied social decision-making task, which models responses to fairness. A number of neuroimaging studies have investigated the UG to identify neural correlates of unfairness and decisions to reject versus accept an offer. We present the first quantitative summary of neuroimaging studies in social decision-making with a meta-analysis of 11 fMRI studies of the UG, including data from 282 participants. Effect-Size Signed Differential Mapping was used to estimate effect sizes from statistical parametric maps and reported peak information before meta-analysing them. Consistent activations were seen in the anterior insula, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), supplementary motor area (SMA) and cerebellum in response to unfair offers. Robust activations in the ACC, SMA and putamen were seen when deciding to reject rather than accept UG offers. These are consistent with models of motivational conflict during the UG decision-making process, a response to norm violations, with a possible role for the reward system.","Gabay, Anthony S; Radua, Joaquim; Kempton, Matthew J; Mehta, Mitul A",Neurosci.

Eye Images Increase Charitable Donations: Evidence From an Opportunistic Field Experiment in a Supermarket,"A number of studies have shown that the presence of simple images of eyes in the environment increases prosocial behaviour in humans. However, questions remain about the robustness of the effect, its explanation and the factors promoting it. In particular, it is not yet clear whether this effect is restricted to contexts where there is a normative requirement to behave prosocially and thus where punishment is a likely consequence of failing to do so. In an 11-wk field experiment in a supermarket, we displayed either eye images or control images on charity collection buckets. There was no normative requirement to donate in this setting, and most people did not do so. However, the presence of eye images increased donations by 48% relative to control images. The effect of eye images was significantly stronger at times when the supermarket was quiet rather than busy. Results are consistent with models of the evolution of prosociality through reputation-based partner choice and have potential practical benefits for those involved in charitable fundraising. © 2012 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.","Powell, K.L.; Roberts, G.; Nettle, D.",Ethology,218

Social Context and the Dynamics of Cooperative Choice,"Recent work using decontextualized economic games suggests that cooperation is a dynamic decision-making process: Automatic responses typically support cooperation on average, while deliberation leads to increased selfishness. Here, we performed two studies examining how these temporal effects generalize to games with richer social context cues. Study 1 found that time pressure increased cooperation to a similar extent in games played with in-group members and out-group members. Study 2 found that time pressure increased cooperation to a similar extent in games described as competitions and games described as collaborations. These results show that previous positive effects of time pressure on cooperation are not unique to neutrally framed games devoid of social context and are not driven by implicit assumptions of shared group membership or cooperative norms. In doing so, our findings provide further insight into the cognitive underpinnings of cooperative decision making. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Rand, D.G.; Newman, G.E.; Wurzbacher, O.M.",J.

Dictator game giving: Altruism or artefact?,"Experimental dictator games have been used to explore unselfish behaviour. Evidence is presented here, however, that subjects' generosity can be reversed by allowing them to take a partner's money. Dictator game giving therefore does not reveal concern for consequences to others existing independently of the environment, as posited in rational choice theory. It may instead be an artefact of experimentation. Alternatively, evaluations of options depend on the composition of the choice set. Implications of these possibilities are explored for experimental methodology and charitable donations respectively. The data favour the artefact interpretation, suggesting that demand characteristics of experimental protocols merit investigation, and that economic analysis should not exclude context-specific social norms. © 2007 Economic Science Association.","Bardsley, N.",Exp.

Exploring the relationship between lay theories of gender and attitudes to abortion in the context of a national referendum on abortion policy,"The relationship between lay theories of gender and attitudes to abortion policy has received minimal empirical attention. An ongoing theoretical debate in the psychological essentialism literature queries whether biological attributions causally influence social attitudes or primarily function to justify existing attitudinal commitments. The current research used the context of a national referendum on abortion in Ireland to investigate whether endorsement of certain gender theories is contingent on their rhetorical construction as supporting particular attitudes to abortion. Two experimental studies were conducted online in the three weeks preceding the Irish abortion referendum. The studies tested whether participants would adapt their causal gender beliefs after reading that biological (Study 1; N = 348) or social (Study 2; N = 241) accounts of gender supported or conflicted with their intended vote in the referendum. Both studies showed the opposite effect: causal gender theories presented as conflicting with participants' voting intentions subsequently showed elevated support, relative to theories that purportedly aligned with participants' voting intentions. While results confirm that lay theories of gender are mutable, the direction of effects does not support the proposition that gender theories are selectively endorsed to support existing socio-political attitudes to abortion. Potential mechanisms for the results observed are discussed. © 2019 O'Connor et al.","O'connor, C.; Maher, P.; Kadianaki, I.",PLoS ONE,223

Alternative Models of Government-Nonprofit Sector Relations: Theoretical and International Perspectives,"Economic theories of the nonprofit sector suggest several different ways of understanding the relationship between government and private, not-for-profit organizations. In particular, different strands of theory support the alternative views that nonprofits (a) operate independently as supplements to government, (b) work as complements to government in a partnership relationship, or (c) are engaged in an adversarial relationship of mutual accountability with government. A historical review of the United States revealed that all three views have validity and that government-nonprofit sector relations must be understood as a multilayered phenomenon. In this article, the foregoing analysis is extended internationally. The three theoretical perspectives are applied to four countries: the United States, the United Kingdom, Israel, and Japan, in an effort to illuminate nonprofit-government relations in those countries and to assess whether the multilayered approach provides a substantially richer understanding than any one theoretical perspective. © 2000, Sage Publications.

The lure technique: Replication and refinement in a field setting,"Many techniques designed to gain compliance to a request are presented in the social psychological literature. However, the lure technique has received little attention from scientists. This technique, also called bait-and-switch, is used to infl uence people's choices and involves three stages: (1) individuals are led to make a rewarding decision to carry out a given behavior; (2) they are informed of the impossibility of carrying out this behavior; (3) a new but less rewarding decision is proposed. Only one formal study has been published on this technique, which failed to control two key methodological factors: the status of the participants and the solicitor, and the delay between the initial decision and the target request. These two factors were controlled in this study. Outside a French campus, 40 female students in the 18–22 age range were solicited by a student to participate in a pleasant experiment for which they would be remunerated. One minute after accepting, they were informed that the number of participants was reached, and they were no longer needed. The solicitor then proposed a diff erent task that was less interesting and not remunerated. Greater compliance with the fi nal request was found in the lure condition (70%) than in the control condition (35%) in which the fi nal request was addressed immediately. The results confi rm the eff ectiveness of the lure technique to increase compliance and show that its eff ectiveness is not dependent on the solicitor's status. © Psychological Reports 2015.","Marchand, M.; Joule, R.-V.; Guéguen, N.",Psychol.

META‐REGRESSION ANALYSIS: A QUANTITATIVE METHOD OF LITERATURE SURVEYS,"Abstract. Pedagogically, literature reviews are instrumental. They summarize the large literature written on a particular topic, give coherence to the complex, often disparate, views expressed about an issue, and serve as a springboard for new ideas. However, literature surveys rarely establish anything approximating unanimous consensus. Ironically, this is just as true for the empirical economic literature. To harmonize this dissonance, we offer a quantitative methodology for reviewing the empirical economic literature. Meta‐regression analysis (MRA) is the regression analysis of regression analyses. MRA tends to objectify the review process. It studies the processes that produce empirical economic results as though they were any other social scientific phenomenon.

Do images of 'watching eyes' induce behaviour that is more pro-social or more normative? A field experiment on littering,"Displaying images of eyes causes people to behave more pro-socially in a variety of contexts. However, it is unclear whether eyes work by making people universally more pro-social, or by making them more likely to conform to local norms. If the latter, images of eyes could sometimes make people less pro-social if pro-social behaviour is not the local norm. To separate these hypotheses we conducted a field experiment in which we explored whether manipulating a local descriptive norm altered the eyes effect. We recorded litter dropping decisions on a university campus in a 2 × 2 design, comparing situations with and without litter already on the ground (a manipulation of the local descriptive norm) and with and without large signs displaying images of watching eyes. We additionally recorded the number of potential human observers in the vicinity at the time of each littering decision. We observed a norm effect: the presence of litter on the ground increased littering, replicating previous findings. We also found that images of watching eyes reduced littering, although contrary to previous findings this was only when there were larger numbers of people around. With regard to our central aim, we found no evidence that litter on the ground interacted non-additively with images of eyes to induce increased littering behaviour. Our data therefore support the hypothesis that images of eyes induce more pro-social behaviour, independent of local norms. This finding has positive implications for the application of eye images in combating anti-social behaviour. © 2013 Bateson et al.","Bateson, M.; Callow, L.; Holmes, J.R.; Redmond Roche, M.L.; Nettle, D.",PLoS ONE,231

Counselling psychology for children?-The questions of training and career paths in an emerging profession,"Through my counseling psychology training and my clinical placement with the Place2Be, a charity that works inside schools to improve the emotional well-being of children, I have become very interested in the experiences and challenges that qualified counseling psychologists encounter when working with children. As a result I am researching this topic for my doctorate - an area in counseling psychology which is often overlooked in training modules and possibly, therefore, future career paths in the profession.Counseling and related interventions are aimed at improving the mental health of children, and meta-analytic reviews confirm the effectiveness of 'therapeutic intervention' over 'no intervention'. The National Institute for Clinical Excellence recommend psychological therapies, in particular individual cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or family therapy, over medication for children and adolescents suffering from depression. Counseling children is an extremely relevant topic at the moment, not least in view of the very unfavorable international comparisons of Britain's children's wellbeing in several recent reports. The intention of this doctorial research is to outline and to explore the reasons for these deficiencies in the counseling psychology literature, and to fill a gap that seems fundamental for the emerging counseling psychology profession.

Asymptotic and resampling strategies for assessing and comparing indirect effects in multiple mediator models,"Hypotheses involving mediation are common in the behavioral sciences. Mediation exists when a predictor affects a dependent variable indirectly through at least one intervening variable, or mediator. Methods to assess mediation involving multiple simultaneous mediators have received little attention in the methodological literature despite a clear need. We provide an overview of simple and multiple mediation and explore three approaches that can be used to investigate indirect processes, as well as methods for contrasting two or more mediators within a single model. We present an illustrative example, assessing and contrasting potential mediators of the relationship between the helpfulness of socialization agents and job satisfaction. We also provide SAS and SPSS macros, as well as Mplus and LISREL syntax, to facilitate the use of these methods in applications.

"A systematic review of large-scale surveys of cancer survivors conducted in North America, 2000-2011","INTRODUCTION: Many large surveys collect data on cancer survivors, but few encompass the full spectrum of domains relevant to survivorship ranging from cancer care to quality of life to late- and long-term effects of cancer and its treatment. Here, we review large data sources in North America collecting cancer survivor-reported health information, and catalogue the domains of cancer survivorship each includes. METHODS: We identified surveys of cancer survivors through a comprehensive web search of federal government agencies, non-profit organizations, and related societies that support health care research or provide health care services, as well as a systematic review of literature indexed on PubMed from 2000-2011. RESULTS: A total of 57 surveys were identified, 26 nationally representative surveys and 31 regional, state, or provincial surveys. Thirty-four surveys specifically targeted cancer survivors, and an additional two surveys had supplements or modules targeted at cancer survivors. Among the nationally representative surveys, general medical characteristics and medical conditions were the most frequently reported cancer survivorship domains, and information on cancer-related costs was least frequently reported. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: Our review demonstrates that a large and growing number of surveys across the U.S. and Canada are collecting data on cancer survivors. These surveys differ in design, geographic region, primary population of interest, cancer site, and research areas of interest. They address a wide range of survivorship issues. Future cancer survivorship research should concentrate on understudied areas in order to better understand the challenges faced by this growing population.","Lerro, Catherine C; Stein, Kevin D; Smith, Tenbroeck; Virgo, Katherine S",J.

Proportion offered in the dictator and ultimatum games decreases with amount and social distance,"Behavior in both the Dictator Game and the Ultimatum Game is of special interest because proposers often violate the predictions of normative economic theory: On average, offers in both games are higher than what would be considered income-maximizing. In the present study, the initial amount provided to the proposer and the social distance between the proposer and the respondent were both varied across a wide range, and the effects of these manipulations on offers in the Dictator Game and the Ultimatum Game were examined in a broad sample of participants recruited via MTurk. Although the amount offered was consistently higher in the Ultimatum Game, the proportion of the amount offered decreased as the size of the initial amount increased in both games. Moreover, the proportion offered also decreased as a function of the social distance between the proposer and the responder. The present results extend our knowledge of the determinants of proposers' behavior in two-person economic games and emphasize the importance of social distance and the amount of money at stake as factors that affect people's economic decisions. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Bechler, C.; Green, L.; Myerson, J.",Behav.

"Religion, parochialism and intuitive cooperation","Abstract: Religions promote cooperation, but they can also be divisive. Is religious cooperation intuitively parochial against atheists? Evidence supporting the social heuristics hypothesis (SHH) suggests that cooperation is intuitive, independent of religious group identity. We tested this prediction in a one-shot prisoner’s dilemma game, where 1,280 practising Christian believers were paired with either a coreligionist or an atheist and where time limits were used to increase reliance on either intuitive or deliberated decisions. We explored another dual-process account of cooperation, the self-control account (SCA), which suggests that visceral reactions tend to be selfish and that cooperation requires deliberation. We found evidence for religious parochialism but no support for SHH’s prediction of intuitive cooperation. Consistent with SCA but requiring confirmation in future studies, exploratory analyses showed that religious parochialism involves decision conflict and concern for strong reciprocity and that deliberation promotes cooperation independent of religious group identity.

Dhanani and Mallory A. McCord (Journal of Applied Psychology, Advance online publication. September 22, 2014. http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/a0037916). Table 3 contained formatting errors. Minus signs used to indicate negative statistical estimates within the table were inadvertently changed to m-dashes. All versions of this article have been corrected. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2014-39088-001.) The purpose of this meta-analysis was to address unanswered questions regarding the associations between personality and workplace safety by (a) clarifying the magnitude and meaning of these associations with both broad and facet-level personality traits, (b) delineating how personality is associated with workplace safety, and (c) testing the relative importance of personality in comparison to perceptions of the social context of safety (i.e., safety climate) in predicting safety-related behavior. Our results revealed that whereas agreeableness and conscientiousness were negatively associated with unsafe behaviors, extraversion and neuroticism were positively associated with them. Of these traits, agreeableness accounted for the largest proportion of explained variance in safety-related behavior and openness to experience was unrelated. At the facet level, sensation seeking, altruism, anger, and impulsiveness were all meaningfully associated with safety-related behavior, though sensation seeking was the only facet that demonstrated a stronger relationship than its parent trait (i.e., extraversion). In addition, meta-analytic path modeling supported the theoretical expectation that personality's associations with accidents are mediated by safety-related behavior. Finally, although safety climate perceptions accounted for the majority of explained variance in safety-related behavior, personality traits (i.e., agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism) still accounted for a unique and substantive proportion of the explained variance. Taken together, these results substantiate the value of considering personality traits as key correlates of workplace safety.",,J. Appl. Psychol.,244
Heal the World: A field experiment on the effects of music with prosocial lyrics on prosocial behavior,"A significant amount of existing research has dealt with the negative effects of music on people's behavior, but only a few studies have shown that music with prosocial lyrics can increase prosocial behavior. This study focuses on the positive effects of music with prosocial lyrics on people in an everyday setting. Based on the general learning model, a field experiment (N = 256, 66% female) was conducted to test whether people exposed to music with prosocial lyrics engaged in more prosocial behavior by buying more fair trade products compared to regular products than did those exposed to songs with neutral lyrics. Guests of a café were randomly assigned to either the prosocial or the neutral music condition and were monitored by two observers who were instructed to report the prosocial purchase (of fair trade coffee) and tipping behavior of the guests. The results indicated that there is a significant positive association between prosocial behavior and the prosocial lyrics of the songs played. The study shows that it is most likely that music with prosocial lyrics can influence one's prosocial purchase behavior in an everyday situation. The underlying mechanisms are still poorly researched, but these findings support the theoretical assumptions. © Society for Education, Music, and Psychology Research.","Ruth, N.",Psychol. Music,245

Compassion fade and the challenge of environmental conservation,"Compassion shown towards victims often decreases as the number of individuals in need of aid increases, identifi-ability of the victims decreases, and the proportion of victims helped shrinks. Such compassion fade may hamper individual-level and collective responses to pressing large-scale crises. To date, research on compassion fade has focused on humanitarian challenges; thus, it remains unknown whether and to what extent compassion fade emerges when victims are non-human others. Here we show that compassion fade occurs in the environmental domain, but only among non-environmentalists. These findings suggest that compassion fade may challenge our collective ability and willingness to confront the major environmental problems we face, including climate change. The observed moderation effect of environmental identity further indicates that compassion fade may present a significant psychological barrier to building broad public support for addressing these problems. Our results highlight the importance of bringing findings from the field of judgment and decision making to bear on pressing societal issues. © 2013.","Markowitz, E.M.; Slovic, P.; Västfjäll, D.; Hodges, S.D.",Judgm.

Short-term effects of prosocial video games on aggression: An event-related potential study,"Previous research has shown that exposure to violent video games increases aggression, whereas exposure to prosocial video games can reduce aggressive behavior. However, little is known about the neural correlates of these behavioral effects. This work is the first to investigate the electrophysiological features of the relationship between playing a prosocial video game and inhibition of aggressive behavior. Forty-nine subjects played either a prosocial or a neutral video game for 20 min, then participated in an event-related potential (ERP) experiment based on an oddball paradigm and designed to test electrophysiological responses to prosocial and violent words. Finally, subjects completed a competitive reaction time task (CRTT) which based on Taylor's Aggression Paradigm and contains reaction time and noise intensity chosen as a measure of aggressive behavior. The results show that the prosocial video game group (compared to the neutral video game group) displayed smaller P300 amplitudes, were more accurate in distinguishing violent words, and were less aggressive as evaluated by the CRTT of noise intensity chosen. A mediation analysis shows that the P300 amplitude evoked by violent words partially mediates the relationship between type of video game and subsequent aggressive behavior. The results support theories based on the General Learning Model. We provide converging behavioral and neural evidence that exposure to prosocial media may reduce aggression. © 2015 Liu, Teng, Lan, Zhang and Yao.","Liu, Y.; Teng, Z.; Lan, H.; Zhang, X.; Yao, D.",Front.

Does Facebook make you lonely?: A meta analysis,"This meta-analysis explores the relationship between Facebook use and loneliness. Examination of the literature containing quantitative measurements of both Facebook use and loneliness, including close variations of the definition of loneliness, produced a sample of 18 research effects (N = 8798) for review. This study asks two main questions: (1) Does using Facebook increase or decrease loneliness?; and (2) What causes what?: Does Facebook make its users lonely (or less lonely), or do lonely people (or less lonely people) use Facebook? First, researchers observed a significant overall average effect in the positive relationship between Facebook use and loneliness. Researchers also point to measurements of Facebook use as well as measurements of loneliness (and its variations) as possible moderating features or sources of variability in the relationship. Testing the relationship between Facebook use and loneliness in the context of two causal models revealed that (a) the first model outlining a path from elements of loneliness to Facebook use was not an adequate explanation of the data; whereas, (b) testing the relationship for a path in the second model from elements of Facebook use to loneliness showed results consistent with the data. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Reputation helps solve the 'tragedy of the commons',"The problem of sustaining a public resource that everybody is free to overuse-the 'tragedy of the commons'1-7-emerges in many social dilemmas, such as our inability to sustain the global climate. Public goods experiments4, which are used to study this type of problem, usually confirm that the collective benefit will not be produced. Because individuals and countries often participate in several social games simultaneously, the interaction of these games may provide a sophisticated way by which to maintain the public resource. Indirect reciprocity8, 'give and you shall receive', is built on reputation and can sustain a high level of cooperation, as shown by game theorists9-11. Here we show, through alternating rounds of public goods and indirect reciprocity games, that the need to maintain reputation for indirect reciprocity maintains contributions to the public good at an unexpectedly high level. But if rounds of indirect reciprocation are not expected, then contributions to the public good drop quickly to zero. Alternating the games leads to higher profits for all players. As reputation may be a currency that is valid in many social games, our approach could be used to test social dilemmas for their solubility.","Milinski, M.; Semmann, D.; Krambeck, H.-J.",Nature,251

In addition to a baseline treatment, in which subjects rolled a die in private and showed a high extent of dishonest behavior, we increased the degree of social control by a novel treatment in which subjects played in randomly assigned pairs of two. The presence of others proved to substantially, but only temporarily reduce dishonest behavior. Furthermore, one treatment group received feedback on unethical behavior of participants in a similar experiment. Knowing that others betrayed in the experiment facilitated social learning and led to a higher prevalence of cheating. Finally, increasing the degree of anonymity by re-running the experiment online increased the extent of norm transgressions slightly. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Inc.","Kroher, M.; Wolbring, T.",Soc.

Harmful or Helpful? A Systematic Review of How Those Bereaved Through Suicide Experience Research Participation,"BACKGROUND: Many of the bereaved through suicide are interested in participating in postvention studies. However, there is a contradiction between the positive experiences of research participation and concerns raised by ethical boards. AIMS: To review studies on the experience of research participation by those bereaved through suicide, including initial contact with the study and its short- and long-term impacts. METHOD: Systematic searches in Embase, Medline, PsycINFO, as well as Google Scholar identified 12 papers reporting on 11 studies. RESULTS: The majority (73-100%) of study participants evaluated participation positively, and would recommend it to others (90-100%), as it was related to altruism, social support, and personal growth. A minority experienced participation as negative (2-10%) or upsetting (5-22%) due to feelings of guilt or painful memories. However, having a painful experience does not preclude seeing it as helpful. LIMITATIONS: Most studies concerned face-to-face psychological autopsy studies, and only two studies included a control group. CONCLUSION: Research applying standardized measures may enhance our understanding of the factors germane to (non-)participation and to the likelihood of a positive/negative research experience. Vigilant recruitment and providing optimum care for participants are indicated. Further research may continue to improve participant safety and the research design of suicide bereavement studies.","Andriessen, Karl; Krysinska, Karolina; Draper, Brian; Dudley, Michael; Mitchell, Philip B",Crisis,253
Unpredictable and competitive cues affect prosocial behaviors and judgments,"Why natural selection would favor thoughts or behaviors that benefit others at the cost of oneself (prosociality) in humans is an intriguing question. The present studies explored two kinds of cues representing overarching environmental factors that might affect prosociality: unpredictability, which represents the variability of extrinsic threats, and competition, which represents the relevance of others' performance to one's fitness. In three experiments, we also took into account the interaction between the two environmental factors and two moderators, namely resource availability and prosocial thinking types. In each experiment, participants were exposed to cues of unpredictability and/or competition before assessment of spontaneous prosocial behaviors (Studies 1 and 2) or prosocial judgments in dual-choice dilemmas (Study 3). Results showed that unpredictable cues generally led to lower prosocial behaviors and fewer prosocial judgments (Studies 2 & 3). In contrast, competitive cues led to lower prosocial behaviors among individuals with resource disadvantages (Study 1), and when combined with unpredictable cues (Study 2). However, competition also led to higher prosocial behaviors among individuals with resource advantages (Study 1) and more prosocial judgments in response to rational, utilitarian dilemmas (Study 3). Taken together, these results indicated that human prosociality is affected by environmental factors in predictable ways. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Zhu, N.; Hawk, S.T.; Chang, L.",Pers. Individ.

Playing prosocial video games increases the accessibility of prosocial thoughts,"Past research has provided abundant evidence that playing violent video games increases aggressive tendencies. In contrast, evidence on possible positive effects of video game exposure on prosocial tendencies has been relatively sparse. The present research tested and found support for the hypothesis that exposure to prosocial video games increases the accessibility of prosocial thoughts. These results provide support to the predictive validity of the General Learning Model (Buckley Anderson, 2006) for the effects of exposure to prosocial media on social tendencies. Thus, depending on the content of the video game, playing video games can harm but may also benefit social relations. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Greitemeyer, T.; Osswald, S.",J. Soc.

Self-Concept Clarity and the Foot-in-the-Door Procedure,"Three studies examined the role self-concept clarity plays in compliance within the foot-in-the-door procedure. Undergraduate participants in Study 1 were either asked to sign a letter to the president encouraging aid for the homeless or did not receive this request. A few days later participants were contacted by phone and asked to take part in a food drive for the homeless. Participants high in self-concept clarity were more likely to agree to the larger request when they first had agreed to the small request, that is, the typical foot-in-the-door effect. However, low self-concept clarity participants were less likely to agree with the larger request after they had agreed to the small request. This pattern was replicated in Study 2 using a different set of requests and a different charitable cause. Study 3 found changes in self-rated helplessness following a foot-in-the-door manipulation that matched the pattern of compliance in the first two studies. The findings provide additional support for the self-perception interpretation of the foot-in-the-door effect and point to 1 explanation for the inconsistent results in research on sequential-request compliance procedures.","Burger, Jerry M; Guadagno, Rosanna E",Basic Appl.

WBC-containing allogeneic blood transfusion and mortality: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials,"BACKGROUND: An association between allogeneic blood transfusion (ABT) and mortality was reported by one team of investigators from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing recipients of non-WBC-reduced versus WBC-reduced RBCs in open-heart surgery. A meta-analysis was undertaken to examine whether this finding can be generalized across clinical settings and/or transfused RBC components. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: RCTs reporting on adverse immunomodulatory effects of ABT between January 1992 and August 2002 were retrieved. Fourteen studies had recorded mortality as a primary or secondary outcome and met all other criteria for meta-analysis. Summary ORs of mortality in a treatment arm receiving WBC-containing allogeneic RBCs versus a control arm receiving autologous or WBC-reduced allogeneic RBCs were calculated across studies, for groups of studies in which the hypothesis of homogeneity was not rejected. RESULTS: There was no association between ABT and mortality across 14 RCTs reporting on short-term mortality (summary OR, 1.20; 95% CI, 0.87-1.65) or across 3 RCTs reporting on long-term mortality (summary OR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.64-1.19). In subgroup analyses, RCTs using autologous blood or conducted in abdominal or vascular surgery showed no difference in mortality, but short-term mortality differed across 3 RCTs conducted in open-heart surgery (summary OR, 2.26; 95% CI, 1.31-3.90; p /= 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: An association between ABT and either short-term or long-term mortality was not detected across clinical settings and transfused RBC components, but subgroup analyses suggest that an association between WBC-containing ABT and short-term mortality may exist in open-heart surgery and in settings where WBC-reduced allogeneic RBCs filtered before storage are administered.","Vamvakas, Eleftherios C",Transfusion,258

The effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of methods of storing donated kidneys from deceased donors: a systematic review and economic model,"OBJECTIVE: To review the evidence for the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of storing kidneys from deceased donors prior to transplantation, using cold static storage solutions or pulsatile hypothermic machine perfusion. DATA SOURCES: Electronic databases were searched in January 2008 and updated in May 2008 for systematic reviews and/or meta-analyses, randomised controlled trials (RCTs), other study designs and ongoing research. Sources included: Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, ISI Web of Knowledge, DARE, NRR, ReFeR, Current Controlled Trials, and (NHS) HTA. Bibliographies of articles were searched for further relevant studies, and the Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) and European Regulatory Agency Medical Device Safety Service websites were searched. Only English language papers were sought. REVIEW METHODS: The perfusion machines identified were the LifePort Kidney Transporter (Organ Recovery Systems) and the RM3 Renal Preservation System (Waters Medical Systems). The cold storage solutions reviewed were: University of Wisconsin, ViaSpan; Marshall's hypertonic citrate, Soltran; and Genzyme, Celsior. Each intervention was compared with the others as data permitted. The population was recipients of kidneys from deceased donors. The main outcomes were measures of graft survival, patient survival, delayed graft function (DGF), primary non-function (PNF), discard rates of non-viable kidneys, health-related quality of life and cost-effectiveness. Where data permitted the results of studies were pooled using meta-analysis. A Markov (state transition) model was developed to simulate the main post-transplantation outcomes of kidney graft recipients. RESULTS: Eleven studies were included: three full journal published RCTs, two ongoing RCTs [European Machine Preservation Trial (MPT) and UK Pulsatile Perfusion in Asystolic donor Renal Transplantation (PPART) study], one cohort study, three full journal published retrospective record reviews and two retrospective record reviews published as posters or abstracts only. For LifePort versus ViaSpan, no significant differences were found for DGF, PNF, acute rejection, duration of DGF, creatinine clearance or toxicity, patient survival or graft survival at 6 months, but graft survival was better at 12 months post transplant with machine perfusion (LifePort = 98%, ViaSpan = 94%, p < 0.03). For LifePort versus RM3, all outcomes favoured RM3, although the results may be unreliable. For ViaSpan versus Soltran, there were no significant differences in graft survival for cold ischaemic times up to 36 hours. For ViaSpan versus Celsior, no significant differences were found on any outcome measure. In terms of cost-effectiveness, data from the MPT suggested that machine preservation was cheaper and generated more quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), while the PPART study data suggested that cold storage was preferable on both counts. The less reliable deterministic outputs of the cohort study suggested that LifePort would be cheaper and would generate more QALYs than Soltran. Sensitivity analyses found that changes to the differential kidney storage costs between comparators have a very low impact on overall net benefit estimates; where differences in effectiveness exist, dialysis costs are important in determining overall net benefit; DGF levels become important only when differences in graft survival are apparent between patients experiencing immediate graft function (IGF) versus DGF; relative impact of differential changes to graft survival for patients experiencing IGF as opposed to DGF depends on the relative proportion of patients experiencing each of these two outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The conclusions drawn for the comparison of machine perfusion with cold storage depend on which trial data are used in the model. Owing to the lack of good research evidence that either ViaSpan or Soltran is better than the other, the cheaper, Soltran, may be preferable. In the absence of a cost-utility analysis, the results of our meta-analysis of the RCTs comparing ViaSpan with Celsior indicate that these cold storage solutions are equivalent. Further RCTs of comparators of interest to allow for appropriate analysis of subgroups and to determine whether either of the two machines under consideration produces better outcomes may be useful. In addition, research is required to: establish the strength and reliability of the presumed causal association between DGF and graft, and patient survival; investigate the utility impacts of renal replacement therapy; determine what the additional cost, survival and QALY impacts are of decreased or increased non-viable kidneys when discarded pre transplantation; and identify a reliable measure for predicting kidney viability from machine perfusion.","Bond, M; Pitt, M; Akoh, J; Moxham, T; Hoyle, M; Anderson, R",Health Technol.

"A quarter century of management research in South Asia – I: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Maldives, Nepal, and Sri Lanka","Purpose - Research from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Maldives, Nepal, and Sri Lanka has received relatively less attention of management scholars. To date, there has been no major review of the content of management research in these rapidly growing economies. The purpose of this paper is to address this gap by reviewing management research in these six countries over a 25-year period from 1990 to 2014. Design/methodology/approach - An electronic search of 11 databases was carried out using 53 search terms pertaining to the field of management. Only articles in journals rated A*, A, or B by the Australian Business Deans Council and either Q1 or Q2 in the Scopus/Imago ratings were included in the study. The articles were then classified as belonging to one of the divisions of the Academy of Management. Results are presented in thematic clusters, highlighting the major focus of management research in these countries. Findings - A total of 211 articles were identified as a result of the search process. The highest number of articles (n = 54) were classified under the ``Public & Non-Profit.'' This was the only area common to research in all six countries as represented by the selected articles. The results are reviewed from an ecological and institutional theory perspective which suggests that the various dimensions of the local environment are reflected in the type of management research emerging from these countries. The paper concludes that these countries represent ``greenfield sites'' in terms of research opportunities for management scholars from all over the world. Originality/value - This review approach adopted in this paper is unique and represents an attempt to be as inclusive as possible without sacrificing quality. This is the first comprehensive and systematic review of management research in these six countries.","Menon, Sanjay T",S Asian Jnl of Global Bus Res,261
Decision-making about broad- and narrowcasting: a neuroscientific perspective,"What differentiates sharing with few, well-defined others (narrowcasting) from sharing with loosely defined crowds (broadcasting)? One possibility involves a trade-off where broadcasting is self-focused and self-serving, and narrowcasting is based on other-oriented, altruistic motives. We present neuroimaging data consistent with a second, parallel-processes perspective. According to this account, both narrow- and broadcasting simultaneously involve self-related and social motives since these concepts are strongly intertwined both on a psychological and neural level. We recorded brain activity within regions that are meta-analytically associated with self-related and social cognition while participants made decisions to narrow- or broadcast New York Times articles on social media. Results show increased involvement of brain regions associated with both self-related and social processing in narrow- and broadcasting, compared to a control condition. However, both processes were involved with higher intensity during narrowcasting, compared to broadcasting. These data help to disambiguate a theoretical discussion in communication science and clarify the neuropsychological mechanisms that drive sharing decisions in different contexts. Specifically, we highlight that narrow- and broadcasting afford differing intensities of two psychological processes that are crucial to persuasion and population-level content virality. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Scholz, C.; Baek, E.C.; Brook O’Donnell, M.; Falk, E.B.",Media Psychol.,262

The watching-eye effect on prosocial lying,"Evidence shows that people tend to behave prosocially when they are in the presence of images depicting eyes. There are two proximate causes of the eyes effect. One involves positive motivation to gain future reward and the other involves negative motivation to avoid violating a norm. Although several studies have suggested that positive motivation is a strong candidate, these studies were unable to distinguish between adherence to norms and prosocial behavior. We investigated the watching-eyes effect in an experimental setting to determine whether the tendency of humans to violate norms voluntarily could be understood as prosocial behavior. We compared the tendency to tell ""prosocial lies"" in the presence of a depiction of stylized eyes (eyes condition) with that involving no such depiction (control condition). Under the control condition, participants tended to tell lies that benefitted others, whereas the tendency toward prosocial lying disappeared under the eyes condition. This suggests that the desire to avoid violating norms by being honest is stronger than the desire to pursue a good reputation by demonstrating generosity when such violation might lead to serious costs. © 2015 by SAGE Publications Inc.","Oda, R.; Kato, Y.; Hiraishi, K.",Evol.

Systematic review of the diagnostic accuracy of 99mTc-HMPAO-SPECT in dementia,"Pathological verification studies (elsewhere) indicate that the application of clinical criteria may be a more sensitive method of detecting AD than brain SPECT; however, SPECT has a higher specificity. SPECT may therefore be helpful in the differential diagnosis of AD. Clinical follow-up studies are needed to establish the predictive role of SPECT with respect to disease progression and treatment response in AD. XCM: This was a generally well-conducted review that addressed a series of relevant and clearly stated research questions. The inclusion criteria were clearly stated and relevant details of individual included studies were well reported. The search strategy was reasonable, though the large number of additional studies identified from sources other than the electronic searches may indicate a poor rate of retrieval. The review process was described clearly and appropriate measures were employed to minimise error and bias in the study selection and validity assessment processes. Criteria relevant to diagnostic accuracy studies were used to assess the methodological quality of the included studies. However, the results of the quality assessment were only reported as summary scores, which limits their usefulness to the reader. The methods used to assess between-study heterogeneity and to generate pooled estimates of measures of diagnostic performance were broadly appropriate. The generation of pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity in the presence of significant, unexplained between-study heterogeneity is of questionable value. The use of standard funnel plots is not recommended as a method of assessing publication bias in systematic reviews of diagnostic accuracy studies. The authors’ conclusions, that clinical examination is more sensitive but less specific than brain SPECT, rely upon data from a post-mortem study published elsewhere and are not derived from the data presented in the review; their reliability is therefore uncertain. XIM: Practice: The authors made no specific recommendations for practice.Research: The authors stated that clinical follow-up studies are needed to validate initial clinical diagnoses and thus provide more reliable accuracy data, and to establish the predictive role of SPECT with respect to disease progression and treatment response in AD.","Dougall, N J; Bruggink, S; Ebmeier, K P",,268
Homophily in Personality Enhances Group Success Among Real-Life Friends,"Personality affects dyadic relations and teamwork, yet its role among groups of friends has been little explored. We examine for the first time whether similarity in personality enhances the effectiveness of real-life friendship groups. Using data from a longitudinal study of a European fraternity (10 male and 15 female groups), we investigate how individual Big Five personality traits were associated with group formation and whether personality homophily related to how successful the groups were over 1 year (N = 147–196). Group success was measured as group performance/identification (adoption of group markers) and as group bonding (using the inclusion-of-other-in-self scale). Results show that individuals’ similarity in neuroticism and conscientiousness predicted group formation. Furthermore, personality similarity was associated with group success, even after controlling for individual’s own personality. Especially higher group-level similarity in conscientiousness was associated with group performance, and with bonding in male groups. © Copyright © 2020 Laakasuo, Rotkirch, van Duijn, Berg, Jokela, David-Barrett, Miettinen, Pearce and Dunbar.","Laakasuo, M.; Rotkirch, A.; van Duijn, M.; Berg, V.; Jokela, M.; David-Barrett, T.; Miettinen, A.; Pearce, E.; Dunbar, R.",Front.

People making deontological judgments in the Trapdoor dilemma are perceived to be more prosocial in economic games than they actually are,"Why do people make deontological decisions, although they often lead to overall unfavorable outcomes. One account is receiving considerable attention: deontological judgments may signal commitment to prosociality and thus may increase people's chances of being selected as social partners±which carries obvious long-term benefits. Here we test this framework by experimentally exploring whether people making deontological judgments are expected to be more prosocial than those making consequentialist judgments and whether they are actually so. In line with previous studies, we identified deontological choices using the Trapdoor dilemma. Using economic games, we take two measures of general prosociality towards strangers: trustworthiness and altruism. Our results procure converging evidence for a perception gap according to which Trapdoor-deontologists are believed to be more trustworthy and more altruistic towards strangers than Trapdoor-consequentialists, but actually they are not so. These results show that deontological judgments are not universal, reliable signals of prosociality. © 2018 Capraro et al.","Capraro, V.; Sippel, J.; Zhao, B.; Hornischer, L.; Savary, M.; Terzopoulou, Z.; Faucher, P.; Griffioen, S.F.",PLoS ONE,271
The effect of other-oriented values on decision making: A test of propositions of a theory of concern for others in organizations,"Based on recent theoretical work by Simon (1990, 1993), we proposed that the value of concern for others would reflect a general process whereby individuals place less value on personal outcomes and are less disposed to engage in rational calculations involving costs and benefits. We conducted two studies to examine whether these mechanisms generalize to situations that do not involve helping others. In the first study, persons high in concern for others were less attracted to choices involving the prospect of personal gain and were less discerning about the value and risk involved in making choices than were individuals low in concern for others. The second study showed that positive affective arousal, which is likely to focus attention on personal concerns, moderated the effects observed in the first study. Results suggest that other-oriented values such as concern for others may have a substantial impact on a wide range of organizational processes beyond helping. © 1996 Academic Press.","Korsgaard, M.A.; Meglino, B.M.; Lester, S.W.",Organ.

Blood donation and the foot-in-the-door technique: A limiting case,"Three experiments with a total of 211 undergraduates tested the effectiveness of the foot-in-the-door technique for recruiting blood donors. Exp I attempted to demonstrate that an earlier failure of this technique was due to poor operationalization rather than to the magnitude of the critical request or to the invalidity of the phenomenon, but it failed to do so. Exp II, designed to more closely resemble other foot-in-the-door studies by using telephone contacts and an initial request for persons to answer questions, was conducted to examine other possible explanations for the 2 previous failures. This experiment also failed to show any foot-in-the-door effect. Exp III was a conceptual replication of Exp II, but used personal contacts. One apparent foot-in-the-door effect emerged in this case, but it was more likely due to a factor other than the experimental treatment. It is concluded that although the foot-in-the-door procedure may influence verbal compliance with requests for minimal forms of aid, it probably will not significantly affect people's willingness to comply with more substantial requests involving behaviors that are psychologically costly.

The cost-effectiveness of screening blood donors for malaria by PCR,"BACKGROUND: The cost-effectiveness of four blood donor screening strategies for malaria was estimated to determine whether transmission by transfusion can be reduced. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A decision analysis model was developed to compare 1) not screening allogeneic blood donors for malaria (Strategy 1); 2) using the standard questionnaire (Strategy 2); 3) using the standard questionnaire followed by testing blood donors with risk factors for malaria with PCR (Strategy 3); and 4) screening all blood donors using PCR (Strategy 4). The expected costs and the number of cases of malaria for each strategy were compared and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated as the cost per case of malaria averted. All costs are in Canadian dollars. RESULTS: Strategies 2 and 3 had the same effectiveness but different costs, with Strategy 3 being less costly. Compared to Strategy 1, the incremental cost effectiveness ratio was 6463 dollars per case of malaria averted for Strategy 3. Strategy 4 resulted in less transmission of malaria (0.4/million donors), but the cost compared to Strategy 3 was 3,972,624 dollars per case of malaria averted. CONCLUSION: The addition of PCR to the standard screening questionnaire is economically attractive compared to the current standard screening questionnaire.","Shehata, Nadine; Kohli, Michele; Detsky, Allan",Transfusion,278
Compassion at Work,"Compassion is an interpersonal process involving the noticing, feeling, sensemaking, and acting that alleviates the suffering of another person. This process has recently received substantial attention by organizational researchers and practitioners alike. This article reviews what researchers currently know about compassion as it unfolds in dyadic interactions in work organizations. We begin by reviewing what we know about the benefits of compassion for the person who is suffering, for the provider of compassion, and for third parties who witness or hear about compassion at work. The heart of the article focuses on what research tells us about embedding compassion in the personal, relational, and organizational contexts in which compassion takes place. We conclude by discussing implications for practice and for the future research agenda regarding this vital interpersonal process. Copyright ©2014 by Annual Reviews.

The dark side of altruistic third-party punishment,"This article experimentally studies punishment from unaffected third parties in ten different games. The authors show that third-party punishment exhibits several features that are arguably undesirable. First, third parties punish strongly a decider if she chooses a socially efficient or a Pareto efficient allocation and becomes the richest party as a result. Interestingly, this form of punishment is especially pronounced in women and more left-wing participants. Second, third parties punish strongly a decider if she chooses an equitable allocation and becomes the richest party as a result. Finally, third parties considerably punish passive parties who make no choice, especially if the latter are richer than the third party. Implications of these findings for social theory are discussed. © The Author(s) 2011.","Leibbrandt, A.; López-Pérez, R.",J. Confl. Resolut.,281
A Dual Process Theory Explanation for Door-in-the-Face Effectiveness,"Two field experiments demonstrate that additive effects of heuristic and systematic processing can explain door-in-the-face technique (DITF) compliance. In Study 1, additive effects of heuristic and systematic processing resulted in an increase in charitable donations. Study 2 replicated the additive effects mean differences observed in the first. Attitude toward a charitable issue was also more strongly correlated with donations in a strong arguments than a no arguments DITF condition, compatible with an additive effects explanation. Both studies indicate that rational processing of argument information has a significant and independent effect on donations in addition to traditional heuristic processing typically inferred in explaining DITF compliance. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Howard, D.J.",Basic Appl.

Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy: evaluating current evidence and informing future research,"Evidence suggested that for patients with three or more previous depressive episodes, mindfulness-based cognitive therapy had an additive benefit to usual care. However, because of the nature of the control groups, the findings could not be attributed to mindfulness-based cognitive therapy-specific effects. Further research was necessary to clarify whether mindfulness-based cognitive therapy produced any specific effects. XCM: The review addressed a clear question and was supported by appropriate inclusion criteria. A number of electronic databases were searched for relevant studies. No language restrictions were applied. Validity was assessed using appropriate criteria and results of the validity assessment were presented. The included studies were of high quality, however, the conclusions were based on the two better quality randomised controlled trials. Two reviewers independently performed study selection, data extraction and validity assessment, reducing the potential for reviewer bias and error. Owing to the small number of included studies and the differences between studies, a narrative synthesis was appropriate. Adequate details of the included studies were presented. This was a well-conducted systematic review and the authors' conclusions are likely to be reliable. XIM: Practice: The authors did not state any implications for practice.Research: The authors stated that further research into mindfulness-based cognitive therapy was warranted. The limitations of the current evidence should be used to shape the direction of future research: longer follow-up periods were needed, data from a variety of outcomes would be useful and improved reporting of trials would allow researchers and clinicians to effectively evaluate future trials. The authors stated that there was a need for randomised controlled trials to compare mindfulness-based cognitive therapy with other non-pharmacological approaches, mere attention and group contact. They also stated that future trials should plan control conditions around the investigation of the potential mechanisms underlying the mindfulness-based cognitive therapy program and examine possible moderators of the effects of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy. the aim would be to help understand why or for whom mindfulness-based cognitive therapy may be useful and enable further development and modification of the program.","Coelho, H F; Canter, P H; Ernst, E",,286
SEQUENTIAL‐REQUEST PERSUASIVE STRATEGIES: Meta‐Analysis of Foot‐in‐the‐Door and Door‐in‐the‐Face,"Meta‐analysis of the foot‐in‐the‐door (FITD) and door‐in‐the‐face (DITF) literatures showed both effects to be small (r = .17, .15 respectively), even under optimal conditions. Both require aprosocial topic in order to work. The amount of time between the first and second requests plays a different role in the operation of each of the two strategies. DITF was effective only when the delay between requests was brief. Effectiveness of FITD was unrelated to delay, but did depend on whether or not an incentive was provided with the first request. The positive relationship between effort and FITD predicted by self‐perception theory was not found. Self‐perception theory and reciprocal concessions theory, the theoretical perspectives usually applied to FITD and DITF respectively are examined in light of the findings and it is concluded that both are flawed seriously.

We carried out a study of laboratory experiment using computer-based Mouselab method to determine the mechanism. We found that different colors altered the altruistic behaviors of people. Specifically, blue enhanced altruism, whereas red discouraged altruism. We used a process-tracing technique to monitor the selection of an adaptive strategy and demonstrate that different colors can simulate changes in information acquisition and then lead to the corresponding behaviors. The results suggested that the decision heuristic plays a mediating role in the link between colors and individual altruistic behaviors. © Copyright © 2020 Nie, Lin, Tu, Fan and Wu.","Nie, X.; Lin, H.; Tu, J.; Fan, J.; Wu, P.",Front.

Brain imaging evidence for why we are numbed by numbers,"We as humans do not value lives consistently. While we are willing to act for one victim, we often become numb as the number of victims increases. The empathic ability to adopt others’ perspectives is essential for motivating help. However, the perspective-taking ability in our brains seems limited. Using functional MRI, we demonstrated that the core empathy network including the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) was more engaged for events happening to a single person than those happening to many people, no matter whether the events were emotionally neutral or negative. In particular, the perspective-taking-related mPFC showed greater and more extended activations for events about one person than those about many people. The mPFC may be the neural marker of why we feel indifferent to the suffering of large numbers of people in humanitarian disasters. © 2020, The Author(s).","Ye, Z.; Heldmann, M.; Slovic, P.; Münte, T.F.",Sci.

Investigating the Relationship Between Self-Perceived Moral Superiority and Moral Behavior Using Economic Games,"Most people report that they are superior to the average person on various moral traits. The psychological causes and social consequences of this phenomenon have received considerable empirical attention. The behavioral correlates of self-perceived moral superiority (SPMS), however, remain unknown. We present the results of two preregistered studies (Study 1, N = 827; Study 2, N = 825), in which we indirectly assessed participants’ SPMS and used two incentivized economic games to measure their engagement in moral behavior. Across studies, SPMS was unrelated to trust in others and to trustworthiness, as measured by the trust game, and unrelated to fairness, as measured by the dictator game. This pattern of findings was robust to a range of analyses, and, in both studies, Bayesian analyses indicated moderate support for the null over the alternative hypotheses. We interpret and discuss these findings and highlight interesting avenues for future research on this topic. © The Author(s) 2018.","Tappin, B.M.; McKay, R.T.",Soc. Psychol. Pers. Sci,296

Real and hypothetical monetary rewards modulate risk taking in the brain,"Both real and hypothetical monetary rewards are widely used as reinforcers in risk taking and decision making studies. However, whether real and hypothetical monetary rewards modulate risk taking and decision making in the same manner remains controversial. In this study, we used event-related potentials (ERP) with a balloon analogue risk task (BART) paradigm to examine the effects of real and hypothetical monetary rewards on risk taking in the brain. Behavioral data showed reduced risk taking after negative feedback (money loss) during the BART with real rewards compared to those with hypothetical rewards, suggesting increased loss aversion with real monetary rewards. The ERP data demonstrated a larger feedback-related negativity (FRN) in response to money loss during risk taking with real rewards compared to those with hypothetical rewards, which may reflect greater prediction error or regret emotion after real monetary losses. These findings demonstrate differential effects of real versus hypothetical monetary rewards on risk taking behavior and brain activity, suggesting a caution when drawing conclusions about real choices from hypothetical studies of intended behavior, especially when large rewards are used. The results have implications for future utility of real and hypothetical monetary rewards in studies of risk taking and decision making.","Xu, S.; Pan, Y.; Wang, Y.; Spaeth, A.M.; Qu, Z.; Rao, H.",Sci.

Pneumatic dilation versus intrasphincteric botulinum toxin injection in the treatment of achalasia cardia in India: an economic analysis,"BACKGROUND: Pneumatic dilation (PD) is an established therapeutic option for achalasia cardia. Recently, intrasphincteric botulinum toxin (BT) has been used to treat achalasia cardia in view of its simplicity and safety. However, it is likely to be a costly treatment as repeated injections are often needed due to its short-lasting effect. No economic analysis of PD and BT strategies has been done in India. METHODS: A decision tree was constructed using decision analysis software (DATA 4.0; TreeAge Software, Williamstown, MA, USA). Probability estimates for BT injection and PD (and, in case of failure, surgery) were obtained from published literature, preferably from India. Direct ""out-of-pocket"" costs (in Indian rupees; currently US$ 1 = 49 rupees approximately) for baseline analysis were obtained from our hospital and from some private hospitals. Sensitivity analysis was done using a wide range of probability and cost estimates. RESULTS: Intrasphincteric BT injection strategy was more costly at 18,520 rupees per patient than PD strategy (4,568 rupees), yielding an incremental cost of 13,952 rupees per patient successfully treated. Sensitivity analysis supported the conclusions of the baseline analysis. CONCLUSION: Primary intrasphincteric BT injection strategy was costlier than primary PD strategy in the treatment of achalasia cardia in India, and therefore cannot be justified despite its efficacy, relative ease of administration and safety.","Ghoshal, U C; Aggarwal, R; Kumar, S; Naik, S R",Indian J.

"The prosocial effects of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA): Controlled studies in humans and laboratory animals","Users of ±3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; 'ecstasy') report prosocial effects such as sociability and empathy. Supporting these apparently unique social effects, data from controlled laboratory studies indicate that MDMA alters social feelings, information processing, and behavior in humans, and social behavior in rodents. Here, we review this growing body of evidence. In rodents, MDMA increases passive prosocial behavior (adjacent lying) and social reward while decreasing aggression, effects that may involve serotonin 1A receptor mediated oxytocin release interacting with vasopressin receptor 1A. In humans, MDMA increases plasma oxytocin and produces feelings of social affiliation. It decreases identification of negative facial expressions (cognitive empathy) and blunts responses to social rejection, while enhancing responses to others' positive emotions (emotional empathy) and increasing social approach. Thus, consistent with drug folklore, laboratory administration of MDMA robustly alters social processing in humans and increases social approach in humans and animals. Effects are consistent with increased sociability, with mixed evidence about enhanced empathy. These neurobiologically-complex prosocial effects likely motivate recreational ecstasy use. © 2015.","Kamilar-Britt, Philip; Bedi, Gillinder",Neurosci. Biobehav. Rev.,303
The relative roles of kinship and reciprocity in explaining primate altruism,"Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the evolution of altruistic behaviours. Their relative roles in explaining actual cases of animal altruism are, however, unclear. In particular, while kin selection is widely believed to have a pervasive influence on animal behaviour, reciprocity is generally thought to be rare. Despite this general agreement, there has been no direct test comparing the relative roles of kinship and reciprocity in explaining animal altruism. In this paper, we report on the results of such a test based on a meta-analysis of allogrooming in primates, grooming being probably the most common altruistic behaviour among mammals. In direct contrast to the prevailing view, reciprocity played a much larger role than kinship in explaining primate allogrooming. These results point to a more significant role of reciprocity in the evolution of animal altruism than is generally acknowledged.","Schino, Gabriele; Aureli, Filippo",Ecol. Lett.,304
Cooperation through image scoring in humans,"The 'tragedy of the commons,' that is, the selfish exploitation of resources in the public domain, is a reason for many of our everyday social conflicts. However, humans are often more helpful to others than evolutionary theory would predict, unless indirect reciprocity takes place and is based on image scoring (which reflects the way an individual is viewed by a group), as recently shown by game theorists. We tested this idea under conditions that control for confounding factors. Donations were more frequent to receivers who had been generous to others in earlier interactions. This shows that image scoring promotes cooperative behavior in situations where direct reciprocity is unlikely.","Wedekind, C.; Milinski, M.",Science,305
Habits of virtue: Creating norms of cooperation and defection in the laboratory,"What explains variability in norms of cooperation across organizations and cultures? One answer comes from the tendency of individuals to internalize typically successful behaviors as norms. Different institutional structures can cause different behavioral norms to be internalized. These norms are then carried over into atypical situations beyond the reach of the institution. Here, we experimentally demonstrate such spillovers. First, we immerse subjects in environments that do or do not support cooperation using repeated prisoner's dilemmas. Afterwards, we measure their intrinsic prosociality in one-shot games. Subjects from environments that support cooperation are more prosocial, more likely to punish selfishness, and more trusting in general. Furthermore, these effects are most pronounced among subjects who use heuristics, suggesting that intuitive processes play a key role in the spillovers we observe. Our findings help to explain variation in one-shot anonymous cooperation, linking this intrinsically motivated prosociality to the externally imposed institutional rules experienced in other settings. © 2016 INFORMS.","Peysakhovich, A.; Rand, D.G.",Manage Sci,306

The social psychophysics of cooperation: Nonverbal communication in a public goods game,"An experiment was conducted to test the hypothesis that cooperation in a social dilemma context could be facilitated by inducing participants to emit ""social psychophysical"" cues, information in the perceptual array that affords meaningful and consequential social inferences. In particular, participants were asked to engage in mutual eye gaze, to touch one another gently, to communicate in a virtual chat room, or to tap out rhythms in synchrony. All but the last of these manipulations increased contributions to a public good in all-male but not all-female groups. These results suggest the inference systems that are engaged when individuals make decisions about whether or not to cooperate in a group context are responsive to relatively low level nonverbal behavioral cues.","Kurzban, R.",J.

The Impact of Public Assistance Use on Charitable Giving: Evidence from the USA and China,"Public policy can directly or indirectly affect private philanthropy. Although previous studies have investigated the role of tax incentives and government grants to nonprofits, scholars do not pay much attention to how public welfare receipt affects philanthropic behavior. This study fills the gap by examining the impact of public assistance use on individual charitable giving using data from the USA and China. We employ propensity score matching to reduce the issue of selection bias and adopt logistic regression and the Tobit model to answer our research question. Our analysis demonstrates the different impacts of public assistance use on charitable giving in the two countries. In the USA, public assistance income is negatively associated with secular giving, and prior public assistance use is negatively related to religious and total giving. However, in China, there is no statistically significant relationship between public assistance use and charitable giving. © 2021, International Society for Third-Sector Research.","Yang, Y.; Zhang, J.; Liu, P.",Voluntas,310

In the salient Islamic treatment, anonymity of donations significantly increased donation incidence from 59% to 77% percent as well as average donations for religious subjects from 8.90 to 13.00.

The use of motivational interviewing in eating disorders: a systematic review,"The studies included in this review indicate the potential for using motivational interviewing in the field of eating disorders, particularly for ‘readiness for change’. XCM: The review addressed a broad question on the effectiveness of motivational interviewing techniques for the treatment of eating disorders. Some inclusion criteria were defined; the review included both studies of patients and their carers. A range of literature sources were searched, but the restriction to English language articles may have resulted in the omission of relevant studies. The authors did not report any measures to reduce error and bias in the review process. No assessment of the methodological quality of the included studies was reported, so it was not possible to assess the potential affects upon the reported finding of methodological weaknesses, either in the review or the included primary studies. As a result, it is difficult to know whether possible error and/or bias (in the review process or in the studies themselves) might have influenced the results of the review. The use of a narrative synthesis was appropriate, given the heterogeneous nature of the included studies.The authors' cautious conclusions broadly reflect the results reported, but should be interpreted cautiously due to the possibility of missed studies and the lack of information on the review process and methodological quality of the included studies. XIM: Practice: The authors did not specify any recommendations for clinical practice.Research: The authors stated that defining the common effective elements between therapies that produce change may be more helpful than comparing different therapies where it may be difficult to ensure that the component ingredients have been successfully delivered. They further suggested that treatment studies should include some markers of treatment fidelity and include information on how adherence to, or receipt of, the intervention was assured.","Macdonald, P; Hibbs, R; Corfield, F; Treasure, J",,313
Eye contact reduces lying,"The perception of watching eyes has been found to reduce dishonest behavior. This effect, however, has only been shown in situations where it can be explained by increased adherence to rules and norms, and thus a watching-eyes effect on dishonesty per se has not been demonstrated. Moreover, the effect has been investigated only with images of watching eyes, not in an interactive situation with a live person, which may arguably have different effects on behavior. In the present study, the effect of watching eyes on dishonesty was investigated with an interactive computer game of lying. Participants played the game against a confederate, whom they believed to be another participant. On each trial, they were briefly presented with a view of the confederate, after which they chose whether to lie in the game. The confederate alternated between the use of direct and downward gaze. The results showed that another individual's direct gaze reduced lying in the game. The findings have implications for both everyday and professional situations, such as clinical conversations and police interrogations. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Hietanen, J.O.; Syrjämäki, A.H.; Zilliacus, P.K.; Hietanen, J.K.",Conscious.

Someone to blame: When identifying a victim decreases helping,"People's willingness to contribute (WTC) more resources to save the lives of identified victims than to save anonymous or statistical victims is known as the identifiable victim effect. Previous research suggested that the emotional arousal (empathy and distress) toward a single identified victim is a major source of the effect. However, identification of a single target may also strengthen negative perceptions (like blame) in situations where the target is perceived as responsible for his/her plight. In five studies (collecting real contributions and hypothetical WTC) we show that identifying a person in need may increase or decrease helping depending on the perceived responsibility of the victim for his/her own plight. Our results suggest that in cases when it is possible to blame the victim, identification of a single target enhances negative perceptions of the victim and decreases helping, especially when the perceiver holds strong beliefs in a just world for others. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.","Kogut, T.",J.

Response Rates in Survey Research: A Meta-Analysis of the Effects of Monetary Gratuities,"A meta-analysis was used to compare the response rate to mailed surveys with (E) and without (C) a monetary gratuity. The average response rate increased 19% when a gratuity was enclosed. When a gratuity was promised (contingent on the return of a questionnaire), the average increase was 7%. Larger gratuities had a greater effect than lesser amounts-an enclosed $1 gratuity increased the response rate by 20%. This pattern was consistent regardless of the salience of the topic or the nature of the population (general vs. professional) surveyed. The impact of the gratuity remained substantial even when the survey design included two mailings-the use of follow-ups did not wash out the effect of the gratuity. The impact of the gratuity appeared to be attenuated by poor survey design and instrumentation, such as a cover letter that failed to present the incentive as a gratuity (rather than compensation). The findings indicate that the external validity of mail surveys can be substantially increased by the use of monetary gratuities.","Hopkins, Kenneth D; Gullickson, Arlen R",J. Exp. Educ.,316
Portuguese public collections and the economic cycle: A seminal study,"Purpose - What are the motivations behind the Portuguese contributions to a public campaign promoted by the National League Against the Cancer?

Findings - It was concluded that Portuguese contributions are significantly related to the local economic cycle. Thus, Portuguese give more if the local economy grows. However, it was verified that an increasing of the number of old people does promote less expressive donated values, which may be understood as deep implications of the decisions taken during a life-cycle pattern (give during the work, save later).

Impact of short-term reconstructive surgical missions: a systematic review,"Introduction: Short-term missions providing patients in low-income countries with reconstructive surgery are often criticised because evidence of their value is lacking. This study aims to assess the effectiveness of short-term reconstructive surgical missions in low-income and middle-income countries. Methods: A systematic review was conducted according to PRISMA guidelines. We searched five medical databases from inception up to 2 July 2018. Original studies of short-term reconstructive surgical missions were included, which reported data on patient safety measurements, health gains of individual patients and sustainability. Data were combined to generate overall outcomes, including overall complication rates. Results: Of 1662 identified studies, 41 met full inclusion criteria, which included 48 546 patients. The overall study quality according to Oxford CEBM and GRADE was low. Ten studies reported a minimum of 6 months' follow-up, showing a follow-up rate of 56.0% and a complication rate of 22.3%. Twelve studies that did not report on duration or follow-up rate reported a complication rate of 1.2%. Fifteen out of 20 studies (75%) that reported on follow-up also reported on sustainable characteristics. Conclusions: Evidence on the patient outcomes of reconstructive surgical missions is scarce and of limited quality. Higher complication rates were reported in studies which explicitly mentioned the duration and rate of follow-up. Studies with a low follow-up quality might be under-reporting complication rates and overestimating the positive impact of missions. This review indicates that missions should develop towards sustainable partnerships. These partnerships should provide quality aftercare, perform outcome research and build the surgical capacity of local healthcare systems.

When death is compelling door-in-the-face compliance under mortality salience,"Research on terror management theory has found evidence that people under mortality salience strive to live up to activated social norms and values. Recently, research has shown that mortality salience also increases adherence to the norm of reciprocity. Based on this, in the current paper we investigated the idea that mortality salience influences persuasion strategies that are based on the norm of reciprocity. We therefore assume that mortality salience should enhance compliance for a request when using the door-in-the-face technique - a persuasion strategy grounded in the norm of reciprocity. In a hypothetical scenario (Study 1), and in a field experiment (Study 2), applying the door-in-the-face technique enhanced compliance in the mortality salience condition compared to a control group. © 2015 Hogrefe Publishing.","Schindler, S.; Reinhard, M.-A.",Soc.

Motivating user-generated content with performance feedback: Evidence from randomized field experiments,"We design a series of online performance feedback interventions that aim to motivate the production of user-generated content (UGC). Drawing on social value orientation (SVO) theory, we develop a novel set of alternative feedback message framings, aligned with cooperation (e.g., your content benefited others), individualism (e.g., your content was of high quality), and competition (e.g., your content was better than others). We hypothesize howgender (a proxy for SVO) moderates response to each framing, andwe report on two randomized experiments, one in partnership with a mobile-app-based recipe crowdsourcing platform, and a follow-up experiment on Amazon Mechanical Turk involving an ideation task.We find evidence that cooperatively framed feedback is most effective for motivating female subjects, whereas competitively framed feedback is most effective at motivating male subjects. Ourwork contributes to the literatures on performance feedback and UGC production by introducing cooperative performance feedback as a theoretically motivated, novel intervention that speaks directly to users' altruistic intent in a variety of task settings. Our work also contributes to the message-framing literature in considering competition as a novel addition to the altruism-egoism dichotomy oft explored in public good settings. © 2018 INFORMS.","Huang, N.; Burtch, G.; Gu, B.; Hong, Y.; Liang, C.; Wang, K.; Fu, D.; Yang, B.",Manage Sci,323
The impact of price promotions on checkout donations,"Purpose: This paper aims to present a model linking price promotions to checkout donations. It is argued that price promotions evoke two perceptions/emotions, namely, feelings of gratitude and perceived sacrifice of purchase, which consequently, influence the likelihood to donate. Feelings of gratitude dominate when the discount is high, while feelings of sacrifice dominate when the discount is low. Compared to no-discount situations, high discounts enhance consumers’ intention to donate while low discounts reduce this intention. Design/methodology/approach: A total of four studies using shopping scenarios are conducted. Study 1 examines the main effect and the mediating factors. Study 2 replicates the findings in different product categories and at different unit-price levels. Studies 3 and 4 test the moderating effects of customer effort and discount framing. Findings: Findings of the four studies provide support for the proposed model. Compared to no-discount situations, high discounts enhance consumers’ intention to donate, while low discounts reduce this intention. The effects are mediated by feelings of gratitude and sacrifice and moderated by effort obtaining the discount and format of the discount. Research limitations/implications: Theoretically, this research advances the understanding of consumers’ interpretations of price promotions. All studies are conducted in an online context. Practical implications: This research informs retailers and charity institutions on the best timing for soliciting checkout donations and indicates specific tactics to enhance consumers’ donations. Originality/value: This is the first study linking price discounts to the growing phenomenon of checkout donations. The research is different from cause marketing where the donation is included in the price of a specific product. The work also differs from studies examining the spillover effect where additional purchases benefit the consumers instead of a cause. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Xia, L.; Bechwati, N.N.",J.

Beta-blockers reduce mortality in patients undergoing high-risk non-cardiac surgery,"Perioperative use of β-blockers in non-cardiac surgery remains controversial, but the evidence suggests that β-blockers significantly reduce risk of mortality in patients undergoing high-risk non-cardiac surgery compared with patients in the lower risk categories. Dose titration of β-blockers targeted on heart rate may contribute to explaining the beneficial effect of these drugs. XCM: The review question and supporting inclusion criteria were clearly defined. Several electronic databases were searched to identify relevant articles. It was unclear whether language restrictions were applied and as no apparent attempts were made to locate unpublished data, potentially relevant data may have been missed. There was no evidence of publication bias. Study quality was assessed using previously published criteria; just under half of the studies were assessed as being at high risk of bias. The authors reported that data extraction was undertaken in duplicate; it was unclear whether this was true for study selection and quality assessment and so reviewer error and bias could not be ruled out. Few patient and study details were reported, which made it difficult to assess whether pooling of the trials was appropriate. There was some evidence of statistical heterogeneity and attempts were made to investigate this. Only a small proportion of trials were classed as undergoing high risk surgery and it was not clear how many patients were included in these trials. Significant subgroup findings were based on comparisons with the least weighting. Uncertainties about the available evidence and the potential for bias in the review process mean that the authors' conclusions should be interpreted with caution. XIM: Practice: The authors stated that the usefulness of β-blockers remained unproved in patients undergoing either intermediate-risk or low-risk procedures. Routine administration was not recomended.Research: The authors stated that further clinical trials were needed to identify the most appropriate timing of starting treatment with β-blockers before surgery and the duration of treatment after surgery. Further research was needed to consider the synergistic effect of concomitant therapies (antiplatelet agents and statins).","Angeli, F; Verdecchia, P; Karthikeyan, G; Mazzotta, G; Gentile, G; Reboldi, G",,328
Erythropoietin to minimize perioperative blood transfusion: a systematic review of randomized trials,"Erythropoietin, when given alone or to augment autologous donation, decreased exposure to perioperative autologous transfusion in orthopaedic and cardiac surgery. Further studies are required to definitively establish the safety of erythropoietin alone, to determine the optimal dose of perioperative erythropoietin, and to compare its efficacy and cost-effectiveness with other methods of minimising perioperative transfusion. XCM: The aims and inclusion criteria were stated. No language restrictions were applied to included studies. Methods used to extract data and assess validity were described. Heterogeneity was assessed statistically and the influence of various factors on the results was evaluated. The discussion included consideration of the following: lack of knowledge of the lowest effective dosing regime for erythropoietin; lack of screening in trials for thrombotic complications; risks of allogeneic blood; other factors that may have influenced results such as skill and commitment of the operative team to reducing blood loss; and unanswered question such as the most efficacious method of using erythropoietin and indications for its use. Some information on the frequency of adverse reactions was reported.No details were given of the methods used to estimate the pooled odds ratio or test heterogeneity.The authors conclusions were supported by the evidence presented. XIM: Practice: The authors consider that it would be prudent to study erythropoietin in more peri-operative patients before using it widely in clinical practice.Research: The authors consider that large randomised trials, preferable in a variety of settings, are needed to compare the effectiveness, safety, and cost-effectiveness of the various methods of minimising exposure to allogeneic blood transfusion.","Laupacis A, Fergusson D",,329
Reciprocal concessions procedure for inducing compliance: The door-in-the-face technique,"Conducted 3 experiments to test the effectiveness of a rejection-then-moderation procedure for inducing compliance with a request for a favor. Ss were a total of 202 passersby on a university campus. All 3 experiments included a condition in which a requester first asked for an extreme favor (which was refused to him) and then for a smaller favor. In each instance, this procedure produced more compliance with the smaller favor than a procedure in which the requester asked solely for the smaller favor. Additional control conditions in each experiment support the hypothesis that the effect is mediated by a rule for reciprocation of concessions. Several advantages to the use of the rejection-then-moderation procedure for producing compliance are discussed.

"The effects of the even-a-few-minutes-would-help strategy, perspective taking, and empathic concern on the successful recruiting of volunteers on campus","This paper assessed the effectiveness of the application of the even-a-penny-helps strategy to recruiting volunteers by changing the wording to “even a few minutes would help.” The moderating, mediating, and direct impact of perspective taking and empathic concern were also investigated. Across conditions, the data (n = 55) were consistent with a model in which perspective taking leads to empathic concern, which in turn, leads to increased volunteering. Whereas more people volunteered (23%) in the even-a-few-minutes group than a direct request control group (14%), the difference was not statistically significant. The effectiveness of the even-a-few-minutes strategy, however, was moderated by perspective taking. The even-a-few-minutes strategy (50%) was substantially more effective than a direct request (5%) for individuals high in perspective taking but counterproductive (6% compliance vs. 33% in the control group) when used on people scoring low on perspective taking. © 2007, Eastern Communication Association.","Takada, J.; Levine, T.R.",Commun.

Afterlife incentives in charitable giving,"There is an expanding literature that examines the influence of religion on economic behaviour. Researchers typically do not distinguish among religions, masking important variation across doctrines. Our article adopts a typology of religions based on the construct of salvific merit. Major religious doctrines are ordered based on their linkage between charitable behaviour in this life and condition in the afterlife. Using the Center on Philanthropy Panel Study (COPPS), we exploit variation in household marginal tax rates (a subsidy to charitable giving) to test the influence of major religious doctrines on charitable giving. We find that charitable giving by adherents to high-salvific-merit religions are less sensitive to changes in charitable subsidies. Adherents to low-salvific-merit religions behave more like nonreligious households. Our results suggest that religious households optimize according to specific doctrines rather than a broad notion of religion. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Thornton, J.P.; Helms, S.",Appl.

Meta-regression analysis in economics and business,"The purpose of this book is to introduce novice researchers to the tools of meta-analysis and meta-regression analysis and to summarize the state of the art for existing practitioners. Meta-regression analysis addresses the rising ""Tower of Babel"" that current economics and business research has become. Meta-analysis is the statistical analysis of previously published, or reported, research findings on a given hypothesis, empirical effect, phenomenon, or policy intervention. It is a systematic review of all the relevant scientific knowledge on a specific subject and is an essential part of the evidence-based practice movement in medicine, education and the social sciences. However, research in economics and business is often fundamentally different from what is found in the sciences and thereby requires different methods for its synthesis-meta-regression analysis. This book develops, summarizes, and applies these meta-analytic methods. © T.D. Stanley and Hristos Doucouliagos 2012.

Fecal microbiota transplantation for Clostridium difficile infection: systematic review and meta-analysis,"Faecal microbiota transplantation had considerable promise as a therapy for recurrent C. difficile infection. XCM: The research question was clear and inclusion criteria were potentially reproducible. Appropriate databases were searched, and attempts were made to minimise language bias. There was no apparent search for unpublished studies and no assessment of publication bias, which meant that relevant studies might have been overlooked. The review process was conducted with sufficient rigour to minimise error and bias. Appropriate quality assessment criteria were applied to the included studies. The clinical variability of study characteristics did not appear to have impacted on the main finding in terms of statistical heterogeneity, and the chosen method of synthesis seemed appropriate. The authors' cautious conclusion reflects the evidence presented and is likely to be reliable. XIM: Practice: The authors stated that the efficacy and safety profile of faecal microbiota transplantation needed to be confirmed in the appropriate population before the approach could be widely advocated. Where this treatment was administered, patients should be counselled on the known and unknown risks.Research: The authors stated that well-designed randomised controlled trials with long-term follow-up registries were needed, along with cost-effectiveness evaluations on faecal microbiota transplantation. Future research should include C. difficile strain typing. It should also seek to establish the definition of recurrent C. difficile infection and develop methods to distinguish this from post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome.","Kassam, Z; Lee, C H; Yuan, Y; Hunt, R H",,336
How do men and women help? Validation of a multidimensional measure of prosocial behavior,"The current study sought to address gender differences in prosocial behavior by creating and validating a multidimensional measure of prosocial behavior that more fully captures the ways that men help others. The new measure is directed toward family, friend, and strangers, and has five factors: defending, emotional support, inclusion, physical helping, and sharing. In Study 1, CFA analyses performed on a sample of 463 emerging adults online (mean age 23.42) revealed good model fit and divergent validity for each of the five factors. Study 2 replicated the analyses on a sample of 453 urban adolescents in the Northwest (mean age 18.37). Results established that all factors had good model fit, construct validity, and convergent validity. The discussion focuses on implications of this measure for future prosocial research including an increased diversity in how people (particularly men) help others and developmental differences toward different targets of prosocial behavior. © 2017 The Foundation for Professionals in Services for Adolescents","Nielson, M.G.; Padilla-Walker, L.; Holmes, E.K.",J.

"Altruistic punishment is connected to trait anger, not trait altruism, if compensation is available","Altruistic punishment and altruistic compensation are important concepts that are used to investigate altruism. However, altruistic punishment has been found to be correlated with anger. We were interested whether altruistic punishment and altruistic compensation are both driven by trait altruism and trait anger or whether the influence of those two traits is more specific to one of the behavioral options. We found that if the participants were able to apply altruistic compensation and altruistic punishment together in one paradigm, trait anger only predicts altruistic punishment and trait altruism only predicts altruistic compensation. Interestingly, these relations are disguised in classical altruistic punishment and altruistic compensation paradigms where participants can either only punish or compensate. Hence altruistic punishment and altruistic compensation paradigms should be merged together if one is interested in trait altruism without the confounding influence of trait anger. © 2018 The Authors","Rodrigues, J.; Nagowski, N.; Mussel, P.; Hewig, J.",Heliyon,338

We also investigate whether incentive compatible choices are consistent with results obtained by hypothetical surveys and whether results remain robust when higher stakes are considered. Our results show when stakes are low, a similar proportion of individuals (about 40%) choose the option that maximizes self-interest and social good and the option that promotes equality. Our findings suggest that hypothetical surveys may lead individuals to overestimate positional concerns and to be insensitive to stakes.

The effect of contest participation and contest outcome on subsequent prosocial behavior,"Following previous research on various aspects of contests, we aim to explore how taking part in a contest affects subsequent behavior. We focus on whether the experience of having just competed in a contest, beyond its outcome, would have an impact on other-regarding decisions towards an individual who was not part of the preliminary contest. In addition, in light of inconclusive results in the existing literature regarding the effect of contest outcome on subsequent prosociality, we reexamine this effect. In line with our hypothesis, participation in a contest was found to reduce prosociality. Additionally, we found that winning a contest reduced prosociality only when decisions were framed as “giving” decisions and not as “dividing” decisions. This finding suggests that the effect of contest outcome may depend on specific elements of the presented situations. © 2020 Moyal, Ritov.

Sixty working mothers, a prime target of guilt appeals, participated in the study. Results indicated that moderate guilt appeals elicited more felt guilt in the working mothers than did low or high guilt appeals. Furthermore, emotional responses, particularly anger, mediated the relationship between level of guilt appeal and consumers' attitudes and corporate attributions, and an inverse relationship occurred between level of guilt appeal and attitudes and attributions. Purchase intention was affected by the level of the guilt appeal and by anger.","Coulter, R.H.; Pinto, M.B.",J. Appl. Psychol.,344

Religion and morality,"The relationship between religion and morality has long been hotly debated. Does religion make us more moral? Is it necessary for morality? Do moral inclinations emerge independently of religious intuitions? These debates, which nowadays rumble on in scientific journals as well as in public life, have frequently been marred by a series of conceptual confusions and limitations. Many scientific investigations have failed to decompose ""religion"" and ""morality"" into theoretically grounded elements; have adopted parochial conceptions of key concepts-in particular, sanitized conceptions of ""prosocial"" behavior; and have neglected to consider the complex interplay between cognition and culture. We argue that to make progress, the categories ""religion"" and ""morality"" must be fractionated into a set of biologically and psychologically cogent traits, revealing the cognitive foundations that shape and constrain relevant cultural variants. We adopt this fractionating strategy, setting out an encompassing evolutionary framework within which to situate and evaluate relevant evidence. Our goals are twofold: to produce a detailed picture of the current state of the field, and to provide a road map for future research on the relationship between religion and morality. © 2014 The Author(s).","McKay, R.; Whitehouse, H.",Psychol.

Estimates are derived from globally comprehensive, internallyconsistent studies using GCM based scenarios. An underestimate of theuncertainty is given. New impact studies can be included following themeta-analytical methods described here.

Confidence intervals of regionally aggregated impacts, however,include both positive and negative impacts for all regions. Global estimatesdepend on the aggregation rule. Using a simple sum, world impact of a1 °C warming would be a positive 2% of GDP, with a standarddeviation of 1%.

How to Detect Altruists: Experiments Using a Zero-Acquaintance Video Presentation Paradigm,"In this study, we investigated the cognitive processes and nonverbal cues used to detect altruism in three experiments based on a zero-acquaintance video presentation paradigm. Cognitive mechanisms of altruism detection are thought to have evolved in humans to prevent subtle cheating. Several studies have demonstrated that people can correctly estimate levels of altruism in others. In this study, we asked participants to distinguish altruists from non-altruists in video clips using the Faith game. Participants decided whether they could trust allocation of money to the targets who were videotaped while talking to the experimenter. In our first experiment, we asked the participants to play the Faith game under cognitive load. The accuracy of altruism detection was not reduced when participants simultaneously performed a cognitive task, suggesting that altruist detection is rapid and effortless. In the second experiment, we investigated the effects of affective status on the accuracy of altruism detection. Compared with participants in a positive mood, those in a negative mood were more hesitant to trust videotaped targets. However, the accuracy with which altruism levels were detected did not change when we manipulated participants’ moods. In the third experiment, we investigated the facial cues by which participants detected altruists. Participants could not detect altruists when the upper half of the target’s face was hidden, suggesting that judgment cues exist around the eyes. We also conducted a meta-analysis on the effect size in each experimental condition to verify the robustness of altruism detection ability. © 2021, The Author(s).","Oda, R.; Tainaka, T.; Morishima, K.; Kanematsu, N.; Yamagata-Nakashima, N.; Hiraishi, K.",J.

Impact of Source Strength on Two Compliance Techniques,"According to social impact theory (Latané, 1981), increasing the strength characteristics of a source of influence should result in increased influence on the target. Using two compliance paradigms, we suggest that this social impact prediction may hold true only when the underlying motive for compliance is due to some form of external impression management (as is hypothesized for the door-in-the-face technique). In this case, the strength of the source should, as Latané predicted, intensify the effect. If, however, compliance is due to an internal motive, such as self-perception (as is hypothesized for the foot-in-the-door effect), we predict the source's strength characteristics will have little or no effect on compliance, even though the resulting compliance is due to the source's request. The results of a door- to-door zoo donation study lent support to both hypothesies. Implications for social impact theory and domain seeking are discussed. © 1989, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

The price of warm glow,"This paper presents a model and experimental evidence to explain the ""volunteering puzzle"" where agents prefer volunteering time to donating money when monetary donations are, ceteris paribus, more efficient for providing resources to charity. In the model agents receive heterogeneous utility from pure and impure altruism (Andreoni, 1989) that permits warm glow to vary between monetary donations and volunteering, thus allowing preferences for impure altruism to rationalize inefficient allocation decisions. We define a measure of the price of impure altruism as the additional proportion of income contributed by a donor to give in the dimension that maximizes her utility, holding the overall charitable contribution constant. To test the predictions of the model we ran an experiment in which we varied within-subjects the costs and benefits of monetary and volunteer donations. We also varied between-subjects the emphasis on either the donation value to the charity (pure altruism) or the contribution of the donor (impure warm-glow altruism). Consistent with the model's predictions, the experiment shows that framing the donation decision from a pure perspective increases the efficiency of donation choices, the substitutability of donations between money and time, and crowding out. Nonetheless, while greater impurity results in a more inefficient allocation of resources, empirically we find that it increases overall charitable donations. We discuss the implications of our experimental results for both theory and policy. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Lilley, A.; Slonim, R.",J. Public Econ.,350
The effect of an image of watchful eyes on the evaluation of the appearance of food,"It is known that an eye-like image promotes generosity. It is also known that the evaluation of the visual deliciousness of food is improved in the presence of an emotionally positive stimulus. The purpose of the present study was to examine whether the presence of open eyes (OPEN) causes generous behavior altering the evaluation of the visual deliciousness of food, and how the images of open and closed eyes (CLOSED) affect human emotions. Seventeen women participated in the present study. A picture of food was presented on a computer screen, and the participants predicted and evaluated its visual deliciousness. An image of OPEN or that of CLOSED was presented simultaneously with a picture of food. There was a significant difference between the OPEN and CLOSED conditions, as demonstrated by the scores on a nine-point Likert scale for visual deliciousness; the ratings in the OPEN condition were significantly higher than those in the CLOSED condition (p = 0.004). There was no significant difference in the image of watchful eyes for the perceived relaxation state; the ratings in the OPEN condition were not significantly higher than those in the CLOSED condition (p = 0.716). The results of the present study revealed that the evaluation of the visual deliciousness of food based on its appearance was likely due to the presence of an image of open watchful eyes, increasing the perceived visual deliciousness of the food without any changes in the participants' emotions. © 2020 Shibuya et al.

Media use and ADHD-related behaviors in children and adolescents: A meta-analysis,"There are several theoretical reasons to believe that media use might be related to attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or ADHD-related behaviors (i.e., attention problems, hyperactivity, and impulsivity). Although studies into the media-ADHD relationship have accumulated, they have yielded inconsistent results. Therefore, we still do not know whether children's media use and ADHD-related behaviors are related and, if so, under which conditions. To fill this gap in the literature, we first identified 6 different hypotheses that may explain why media use in general and viewing fast-paced or violent media content might be related to 1 or more ADHD-related behaviors. Subsequently, we conducted a meta-analysis of 45 empirical studies investigating the relationship between media use and ADHD-related behaviors in children and adolescents. Our results indicated a small significant relationship between media use and ADHD-related behaviors (r+ = .12). Finally, we identified several specific gaps in the existing literature and presented 5 crucial directions for future research.","Nikkelen, S.W.; Valkenburg, P.M.; Huizinga, M.; Bushman, B.J.",Dev Psychol,355
Political identity moderates the effect of watchful eyes on voter mobilization: A reply to Matland and Murray (2019),"Matland and Murray (2019) reanalyze three of their previous field experiments and fail to reproduce the finding reported in Panagopoulos and van der Linden (2016) that political identity moderates the watchful eye effect on voter mobilization in elections. We highlight several concerns with their empirical approach, including lack of power and between-study differences, that lead us to conclude that the authors offer little evidence against partisan heterogeneity. By contrast, closer inspection and additional analyses of the data reported in Panagopoulos and van der Linden (2016) only reinforce our original conclusion that partisanship moderates voter responsiveness to watchful eyes. Specifically, Republicans appear to be more susceptible to watchful eyes compared to Democrats in the context of voting in elections. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Panagopoulos, C.; van der Linden, S.",Soc.

A meta-analysis of the effects of texting on driving,"Text messaging while driving is considered dangerous and known to produce injuries and fatalities. However, the effects of text messaging on driving performance have not been synthesized or summarily estimated. All available experimental studies that measured the effects of text messaging on driving were identified through database searches using variants of ""driving"" and ""texting"" without restriction on year of publication through March 2014. Of the 1476 abstracts reviewed, 82 met general inclusion criteria. Of these, 28 studies were found to sufficiently compare reading or typing text messages while driving with a control or baseline condition. Independent variables (text-messaging tasks) were coded as typing, reading, or a combination of both. Dependent variables included eye movements, stimulus detection, reaction time, collisions, lane positioning, speed and headway. Statistics were extracted from studies to compute effect sizes (rc). A total sample of 977 participants from 28 experimental studies yielded 234 effect size estimates of the relationships among independent and dependent variables. Typing and reading text messages while driving adversely affected eye movements, stimulus detection, reaction time, collisions, lane positioning, speed and headway. Typing text messages alone produced similar decrements as typing and reading, whereas reading alone had smaller decrements over fewer dependent variables. Typing and reading text messages affects drivers' capability to adequately direct attention to the roadway, respond to important traffic events, control a vehicle within a lane and maintain speed and headway. This meta-analysis provides convergent evidence that texting compromises the safety of the driver, passengers and other road users. Combined efforts, including legislation, enforcement, blocking technologies, parent modeling, social media, social norms and education, will be required to prevent continued deaths and injuries from texting and driving. © 2014 The Authors.","Caird, J.K.; Johnston, K.A.; Willness, C.R.; Asbridge, M.; Steel, P.",Accid.

"Effects of Prosocial, Neutral, and Violent Video Games on College Students' Affect","Recent research reveals that playing prosocial video games increases prosocial cognitions and helpful behaviors [Gentile el al., 2009; Greitemeyer and Osswald, 2009; 2010; 2011]. These results are consistent with social-cognitive models of social behavior [e.g., the ""General Learning Model,"" Buckley and Anderson, 2006]. The social-cognitive learning models suggest that in addition to influencing cognitions, media content may also influence affect. However, past studies on prosocial video games have failed to find a significant effect on affective measures [Greitemeyer and Osswald, 2010]. The present research examined the effects of prosocial, neutral, and violent video games on state hostility and positive affect. Also examined were moderating effects of trait aggressiveness, trait altruistic helping, and trait egoistic helping. Prosocial games reduced state hostility and increased positive state affect. Violent video games had the opposite effects. These effects were moderated by trait physical aggression. Altruistic participants reported relatively more positive affect and less state hostility. Egoistic participants reported relatively more aggravated and mean feelings. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Saleem, M.; Anderson, C.A.; Gentile, D.A.",Aggress. Behav.,359
The social psychology of aggression: 3rd edition,"Thoroughly revised and updated, this third edition offers a comprehensive and up-to-date overview of the social psychology of aggression, covering all the relevant major theories, individual differences, situational factors, and applied contexts. Understanding the causes, forms, and consequences of aggression and violence is critical for dealing with these harmful forms of social behavior. Addressing a range of sub-topics, the first part deals with the definition and measurement of aggression, presents major theories, examines the development of aggression and discusses individual and gender differences in aggressive behaviour. It covers the role of situational factors in eliciting aggression and the impact of exposure to violence in the media. The second part examines specific forms and manifestations of aggression, including chapters on aggression in everyday contexts and in the family, sexual aggression, intergroup aggression, and terrorism. The new edition also includes additional coverage of gender differences, gun violence, and terrorism, to reflect the latest research developments in the field. Also discussing strategies for reducing and preventing aggression, this book is essential reading for students and researchers in psychology and related disciplines, as well as practitioners and policy makers. © 2021 Barbara Krahé.","Krahé, B.",The Social Psychology of Aggression: 3rd Edition,360
The acute effects of whole blood donation on cardiorespiratory and haematological factors in exercise: A systematic review,"BACKGROUND: This systematic review aimed to collect the relevant historical and current literature to produce an informed analysis of the acute effects on cardiorespiratory and haematological factors following whole blood donation (~ 470 ml) during exercise. Testing the hypothesises that blood donation produces either no changes (Null) or produces significant changes (alternate) in haematology, [Formula: see text], heart rate, exercising power and time. METHODS: Four databases of medical and science orientations were searched with terms sensitive to connections regarding exercise, blood donation (400-500 ml)/haematology, [Formula: see text], heart rate, exercising power and time. The study retrieval process utilised the PRISMA approach and selection was via an adapted scoring method according to the Consensus based Standards for the selection of health Measurements Instruments (COSMIN). Systematic review focused on 24-48 hrs post donation. Details of the PRSIMA checklist can be found in the accompanying online document. RESULTS: Following scrutiny of 48 research papers by two independent assessors 8 experimental studies were included. Four studies showed a mean reduction for difference in [Formula: see text] (- 2.4 ± 1.4 ml∙kg-1∙min-1) and a medium effect size (-0.26). No statistical significance was present at the mean meta-analysis level, also the case for heart rate, time to exhaustion and power. A mean reduction was seen in haemoglobin (- 1.05 g.dL-1), haematocrit (- 3.71%) and red blood cells (- 0.44 Mio μL-1), very large effect size was observed (Cohen's d, -0.75, -1.16 and -4.23 respectively) and statistical significance (95% CI, -2.04, -0.54; -4.59, 2.28 and -4.37, -4.10 respectively). CONCLUSION: Although individual studies show that [Formula: see text] Is reduced from blood donation pooled results show that [Formula: see text] is indeed not significantly reduced from blood donation 24-48 hrs post donation. Additionally sub-maximally there isn't enough data to produce substantial comparatives. Furthermore, this systematic review demonstrates that there are not enough high-quality studies regarding cardiorespiratory outcomes following blood donation.","Johnson, Diane Maria; Roberts, Justin; Gordon, Dan",PLoS One,361
Sociality mental modes modulate the processing of advice-giving: An event-related potentials study,"People have different motivations to get along with others in different sociality mental modes (i.e., communal mode and market mode), which might affect social decision-making. The present study examined how these two types of sociality mental modes affect the processing of advice-giving using the event-related potentials (ERPs). After primed with the communal mode and market mode, participants were instructed to decide whether or not give an advice (profitable or damnous) to a stranger without any feedback. The behavioral results showed that participants preferred to give the profitable advice to the stranger more slowly compared with the damnous advice, but this difference was only observed in the market mode condition. The ERP results indicated that participants demonstrated more negative N1 amplitude for the damnous advice compared with the profitable advice, and larger P300 was elicited in the market mode relative to both the communal mode and the control group. More importantly, participants in the market mode demonstrated larger P300 for the profitable advice than the damnous advice, whereas this difference was not observed at the communal mode and the control group. These findings are consistent with the dual-process system during decision-making and suggest that market mode may lead to deliberate calculation for costs and benefits when giving the profitable advice to others. © 2018 Li, Zhan, Fan, Liu, Li, Sun and Zhong.","Li, J.; Zhan, Y.; Fan, W.; Liu, L.; Li, M.; Sun, Y.; Zhong, Y.",Front.

Government Support and Charitable Donations: A Meta-Analysis of the Crowding-out Hypothesis,"With the growing body of literature on governance styles in which nonprofit organizations are involved in creating and implementing public services, there is a need for robust evidence on the effects of public funding on nonprofit revenues. This paper systematically reviews previous studies on the crowding-out hypothesis, which holds that private charitable donations are lower in situations of higher government support and vice versa. We find that about two-thirds of previous estimates fnd a negative correlation (crowding-out), while one-third of the estimates find a positive correlation (crowding-in). The results are strongly shaped by the research methods that are used. In experiments, a $1 increase in government support is associated with an average $0.64 decrease in private donations, while nonexperimental data analyses find an average increase of $0.06. Random-effects regression models show that, contrary to arguments that are prevalent in the literature, studies that take subsidies to organizations as a measure of government support are less likely to estimate crowding-out than studies that use a measure of direct government expenditures. Central government support is associated with higher charitable donations, while measures that include multiple levels of government tend to find negative correlations. The results challenge the consistency of prior research findings and demonstrate the contextual dependence of the validity of the crowding-out hypothesis. © The Author 2016.","de Wit, Arjen; Bekkers, René",Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory,364

The door-in-the-face technique after eating: A field experiment on the self-regulatory function of affect as a resource,"A field experiment was conducted to examine the effects of food and the ""door-in-the-face technique"" on compliance with a request that one participate in a psychological experiment. It was predicted that positive affect was induced in participants who did eat, while those who did not eat were deemed to have neutral affect. Participants then received a rejection-then- moderation procedure (i.e., the door-in-the-face technique) or not, in that half of the participants were induced to refuse a large initial request and then asked a small request, while the other half were asked only a small request. Participants who experienced either a positive event (eating) or a negative event (normative pressure for reciprocation of concession) were more likely to agree to participate in an experiment than did neutral affect controls, likely because of mood maintenance or mood repair. However, people who were subjected to both events helped no more than did controls. This latter result suggests that positive affect may function as a resource that provides a psychological buffer against negative affect. Participants who complied in the no-food/no-technique and food/technique conditions rationalized their own behavior (i.e., engaged in dissonance reduction). The theoretical implications of our findings are discussed, with respect to the manipulation and measurement of affect.","Yagi, Y.; Hirabayashi, Y.",Shinrigaku Kenkyu,366

A Review and Meta-Analysis of the Nomological Network of Trainee Reactions,"A review and meta-analysis of studies assessing trainee reactions are presented. Results suggest reactions primarily capture characteristics of the training course, but trainee characteristics (e.g., anxiety and pretraining motivation) and organizational support also have a moderate effect on reactions. Instructional style (ρ = .66) followed by human interaction (ρ = .56) were the best predictors of reactions. Reactions predicted pre-to-post changes in motivation (β = .51) and self-efficacy (β = .24) and were more sensitive than affective and cognitive learning outcomes to trainees' perceptions of characteristics of the training course. Moderator analyses revealed reactions-outcomes correlations tended to be stronger in courses that utilized a high level rather than a low level of technology, and affective and utility reactions did not differ in their relationships with learning outcomes. The current study clarifies the nomological network of reactions and specifies outcomes that are theoretically related to reactions. © 2008 American Psychological Association.","Sitzmann, T.; Brown, K.G.; Casper, W.J.; Ely, K.; Zimmerman, R.D.",J.

"Social eavesdropping: Can you hear the emotionality in a ""hello"" that is not meant for you?","The study examined third-party listeners' ability to detect the Hellos spoken to prevalidated happy, neutral, and sad facial expressions. The average detection accuracies from the happy and sad (HS), happy and neutral (HN), and sad and neutral (SN) listening tests followed the average vocal pitch differences between the two sets of Hellos in each of the tests; HS and HN detection accuracies were above chance reflecting the significant pitch differences between the respective Hellos. The SN detection accuracy was at chance reflecting the lack of pitch difference between sad and neutral Hellos. As expected, the SN detection accuracy positively correlated with theory of mind; participating in these tests has been likened to the act of eavesdropping, which has been discussed from an evolutionary perspective. An unexpected negative correlation between the HS detection accuracy and the empathy quotient has been discussed with respect to autism research on empathy and pitch discrimination. © The Author(s) 2017.","Karthikeyan, S.; Ramachandra, V.",i-Perception,369
Personal assistance for older adults (65+) without dementia,"BACKGROUND: There is a high prevalence of impairments among people 65+, and the elderly population is increasing in the West. Many countries offer personal assistance, individualised support for people living in the community by a paid assistant other than a healthcare professional for at least 20 hours per week. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of personal assistance for older adults with impairments, and the impacts of personal assistance on others, compared to other interventions. SEARCH STRATEGY: Electronic databases including CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, ERIC, Dissertation Abstracts International and a variety of specialist Swedish databases were searched from 1980 to June 2005; reference lists were checked; 345 experts, organisations, government bodies and charities were contacted in an attempt to locate relevant research. SELECTION CRITERIA: This review included older adults (65+) living in the community who require assistance to perform tasks of daily living (e.g., bathing and eating) and participate in normal activities due to permanent impairments. Controlled studies of personal assistance in which participants were prospectively assigned to study groups and in which control group outcomes were measured concurrently with intervention group outcomes were included. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Titles and abstracts were examined by two reviewers. Outcomes data were extracted. Because they made different comparisons, studies were not combined for meta-analyses. Studies were assessed for the possibility of bias. Results and potential sources of bias are presented for included studies. MAIN RESULTS: Four studies involving 1642 participants made three eligible comparisons: (i) personal assistance versus usual care, (ii) personal assistance versus nursing homes, and (iii) personal assistance versus 'cluster care'. One was an RCT, three were non-randomised. Personal assistance was generally preferred over other services; however, some people prefer other models of care. This review indicates that personal assistance probably has some benefits for some recipients and caregivers. Paid assistance probably substitutes for informal care and may cost government more than alternatives; however, the total costs to recipients and society are currently unknown. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Research in this field is limited. Personal assistance is expensive and difficult to organise, especially in places that do not already have services in place. When implementing new programmes, recipients could be randomly assigned to different forms of assistance. While advocates may support personal assistance for myriad reasons, this review demonstrates that further studies are required to determine which models of personal assistance are most effective and efficient.","Montgomery, P; Mayo-Wilson, E; Dennis, J",Cochrane Database Syst.

A systematic review of presumed consent systems for deceased organ donation,"OBJECTIVES: To examine the impact of presumed consent legislation on organ donation and to review data on attitudes to presumed consent among the public, professionals and any other stakeholders. DATA SOURCES: Eight electronic databases (MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, HMIC, PAIS International and OpenSIGLE) were searched from inception to January 2008. Supplementary internet searches were also performed. REVIEW METHODS: A systematic review of studies comparing donation rates in a single country before and after the introduction of a presumed consent law or in countries with and without presumed consent systems. The methodological quality of these studies was assessed and a narrative synthesis of results undertaken. Surveys of attitudes towards presumed consent legislation were also included. RESULTS: Over 2000 potentially relevant citations were identified, of which 13 studies met the inclusion criteria for the primary objective and 13 for the secondary objective. For the primary objective, eight studies were between-country comparisons and five were before-and-after studies. Four of the between-country comparisons were of sufficient methodological quality to provide reliable results. In all four studies presumed consent law or practice was associated with increased rates of organ donation, ranging from an increase of 2.7 donors per million population (pmp) in one study to 6.14 donors per million in another, and an increase of between 20% and 30% in two other studies. Factors other than presumed consent that had an impact on organ donation rates were mortality from road traffic accidents and cerebrovascular accident, the transplant capacity of a country, gross domestic product per capita and health expenditure per capita, religion, education, public access to information and a common law legal system. The five before-and-after studies represented three countries, all of which reported an increase in donation rates following the introduction of a presumed consent system (Austria, from 4.6 to 27.2 donors pmp over a 5-year period; Belgium, increase in kidney donation from 10.9 to 41.3 pmp during a 3-year period; Singapore, increase in kidney procurement from 4.7 to 31.3 per year in the 3 years after the change in legislation). There was very limited investigation of any other changes taking place concurrently with the changes in legislation across this set of studies. Of the 13 studies addressing the secondary objective, eight were surveys of the UK public, four were from other countries and one was an international survey of health professionals. There was variation among the UK surveys in the level of support for presumed consent, with surveys conducted before 2000 reporting the lowest levels of support (28-57%). The most recent survey by YouGov in 2007 reported that 64% of respondents supported a change to presumed consent. CONCLUSIONS: Presumed consent alone is unlikely to explain the variation in organ donation rates between different countries. A combination of legislation, availability of donors, transplantation system organisation and infrastructure, wealth and investment in health care, as well as underlying public attitudes to and awareness of organ donation and transplantation, may all play a role, although the relative importance of each is not clear. Further reviews could investigate the factors likely to modify donor rates, such as procedures for family involvement. The way in which families of any potential donor are approached is likely to be an important factor and a review of qualitative research examining the experience of relatives in this context would be useful.","Rithalia, A; McDaid, C; Suekarran, S; Norman, G; Myers, L; Sowden, A",Health Technol.

Study 1 revealed that the more individuals' habitual self-regulatory orientation is dominated by a vigilant prevention focus, the more likely they are to act cooperatively (i.e. to donate money to natural conservation organizations) when a subtle cue of being watched renders reputational concerns salient. In contrast, when no such cue is provided individuals' habitual vigilant self-regulatory orientation is negatively related to cooperative behaviour.

"Do sex and violence sell? A meta-analytic review of the effects of sexual and violent media and ad content on memory, attitudes, and buying intentions","It is commonly assumed that sex and violence sell. However, we predicted that sex and violence would have the opposite effect. We based our predictions on the evolution and emotional arousal theoretical framework, which states that people are evolutionarily predisposed to attend to emotionally arousing cues such as sex and violence. Thus, sexual and violent cues demand more cognitive resources than nonsexual and nonviolent cues. Using this framework, we meta-analyzed the effects of sexual media, violent media, sexual ads, and violent ads on the advertising outcomes of brand memory, brand attitudes, and buying intentions. The meta-analysis included 53 experiments involving 8,489 participants. Analyses found that brands advertised in violent media content were remembered less often, evaluated less favorably, and less likely to be purchased than brands advertised in nonviolent, nonsexual media. Brands advertised using sexual ads were evaluated less favorably than brands advertised using nonviolent, nonsexual ads. There were no significant effects of sexual media on memory or buying intentions. There were no significant effects of sexual or violent ads on memory or buying intentions. As intensity of sexual ad content increased, memory, attitudes, and buying intentions decreased. When media content and ad content were congruent (e.g., violent ad in a violent program), memory improved and buying intentions increased. Violence and sex never helped and often hurt ad effectiveness. These results support the evolution and emotional arousal framework. Thus, advertisers should consider the effects of media content, ad content, content intensity, and congruity to design and place more effective ads. © 2015 American Psychological Association.","Lull, R.B.; Bushman, B.J.",Psychol.

Systematic review of attitudes toward donation after cardiac death among healthcare providers and the general public,"OBJECTIVE: Organ donation after cardiac death (DCD) is one promising possibility of combating the organ shortage, but it raises ethical issues that differ from those raised in donation after brain death (DBD). Also, DCD may be perceived differently than DBD by medical staff and the public. The aim of this article is to systematically review empirical studies on attitudes of medical personnel and the public toward DCD and to discuss the findings from an ethical perspective. Our study was conducted in accordance with a seven-step approach for systematic reviews of empirical studies in bioethics. DATA SOURCES: The authors chose PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, PSYCINFO, and PSYNDEX, thus attempting to cover biomedical, sociological and ethical articles on the subject. STUDY SELECTION: A search algorithm using controlled vocabulary of the respective databases (where applicable) was created, and criteria for the relevance assessment of the articles were established. Article quality was assessed using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme tool. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: The authors took an integrative approach to the data, combining it for further analysis. Qualitative data were synthesized by means of thematic analysis, and a spectrum of relevant themes was identified. Then the authors extracted the quantitative data that corresponded with the identified themes. Quantitative data on common subjects were juxtaposed and presented later. CONCLUSIONS: Identified themes were the levels of support for DBD vs. DCD, attitudes toward postmortem measures without previous consent, lack of knowledge about DCD, concerns about the Dead Donor Rule, the potential for conflict of interest, making donation happen, and the call for standardized DCD protocols. All of these issues are of ethical relevance and merit further discussion. We conclude that deep-rooted concerns about DCD exist among medical personnel and the general public. These need to be taken seriously in order to maintain or foster trust in the transplantation system.","Bastami, Sohaila; Matthes, Oliver; Krones, Tanja; Biller-Andorno, Nikola",Crit. Care Med.,376
Watching Eyes effects: When others meet the self,"The perception of direct gaze—that is, of another individual's gaze directed at the observer—is known to influence a wide range of cognitive processes and behaviors. We present a new theoretical proposal to provide a unified account of these effects. We argue that direct gaze first captures the beholder's attention and then triggers self-referential processing, i.e., a heightened processing of stimuli in relation with the self. Self-referential processing modulates incoming information processing and leads to the Watching Eyes effects, which we classify into four main categories: the enhancement of self-awareness, memory effects, the activation of pro-social behavior, and positive appraisals of others. We advance that the belief to be the object of another's attention is embedded in direct gaze perception and gives direct gaze its self-referential power. Finally, we stress that the Watching Eyes effects reflect a positive impact on human cognition; therefore, they may have a therapeutic potential, which future research should delineate. © 2016 The Authors","Conty, L.; George, N.; Hietanen, J.K.",Conscious.

However, it is possible that the seemingly positive link between age and preferences stems from confounds in experimental procedure. In a dictator game study we find that elderly participants do indeed transfer higher shares of their endowments to their peers than a standard sample of student participants. This result holds good even in treatments accounting for wealth differences and experimenter demand effects. However, we observe no difference in behavior when we compare elderly participants and students who have not previously participated in economic experiments. Accordingly, it is possible that the seemingly stronger social preferences of the elderly are due to confounds associated with lack of experience with economic experiments. In addition, when comparing incentivized and hypothetical transfer decisions, we observe a hypothetical bias in treatments with a ""take"" framing, but not in treatments with the standard ""give"" framing. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Kettner, S.E.; Waichman, I.",J.

Personal assistance for adults (19-64) with both physical and intellectual impairments,"BACKGROUND: There is a high incidence of impairments among working age adults, and their prevalence is increasing in the West. Many countries offer personal assistance in the form of individualised support for people living in the community by a paid assistant other than a healthcare professional for at least 20 hours per week. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of personal assistance for adults with physical and intellectual impairments, and the impacts of personal assistance on others, compared to other interventions. SEARCH STRATEGY: Electronic databases including CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, ERIC, Dissertation Abstracts International and a variety of specialist Swedish databases were searched from 1980 to June 2005; reference lists were checked; 345 experts, organisations, government bodies and charities were contacted in an attempt to locate relevant research. SELECTION CRITERIA: Adults (19-64) with permanent physical and intellectual impairments living in the community who require assistance to perform tasks of daily living (e.g., bathing and eating) and participate in normal activities. Controlled studies of personal assistance in which participants were prospectively assigned to study groups and in which control group outcomes were measured concurrently with intervention group outcomes were included. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Titles and abstracts were examined by two reviewers. Outcome data were extracted. Because no two studies made the same comparison, studies were not combined for meta-analyses. Studies were assessed for bias. Results and potential sources of bias are presented for included studies. MAIN RESULTS: Two studies involving 1002 participants compared personal assistance versus usual care. Whilst personal assistance was generally preferred over other services, some people prefer other services. Personal assistance may have some benefits for some recipients and may benefit caregivers. Paid assistance probably substitutes for informal care and may cost government more than alternatives; however, some evidence suggests it may reduce costs. The total costs to recipients and society are unknown. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Research in this field is limited. Personal assistance is expensive and difficult to organise, especially in places that do not already have services in place, but its total cost relative to other services is unknown. When implementing new programmes, recipients could be randomly assigned to different forms of assistance (e.g. organised by individual users versus organised through a cooperative). While advocates may support personal assistance for myriad reasons, this review demonstrates that further studies are required to determine which models of assistance are most effective and efficient for particular people.","Mayo-Wilson, E; Montgomery, P; Dennis, J",Cochrane Database Syst.

Does the truth come naturally? Time pressure increases honesty in one-shot deception games,"Many situations require people to act quickly and are characterized by asymmetric information. Since asymmetric information makes people tempted to misreport their private information for their own benefit, it is of primary importance to understand whether time pressure affects honest behavior. A theory of social heuristics (the Social Heuristics Hypothesis, SHH), predicts that, in case of one-shot interactions, such an effect exists and it is positive. The SHH proposes that when people have no time to evaluate all available alternatives, they tend to rely on heuristics, choices that are optimal in everyday, repeated interactions and that have been internalized over time; and then, after deliberation, people shift their behavior towards the one that is optimal in the given interaction. Thus, the SHH predicts that time pressure increases honesty in one-shot interactions (because honesty may be optimal in repeated interactions, while dishonesty is always optimal in the short run). However, to the best of our knowledge, no experimental studies have tested this prediction. Here, I report a large (N=1013) study aimed at filling this gap. In this study, participants were given a private information and were asked to report it within 5 s vs after 30 s. The interaction was one-shot, and payoffs were such that subjects had an incentive to lie. As predicted by the SHH, I find that time pressure increases honest behavior. In doing so, these results provide new insights on the role of time pressure on honesty, and provide one more piece of evidence in support of the Social Heuristics Hypothesis. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Capraro, V.",Econ.

Mechanism in behavioural economics,"Behavioural economics promises to bring economics closer to being evidence based. However, its ability to do this may depend on a methodological issue: whether the findings of behavioural economics are used to modify or extend standard theory, or to contribute towards replacing it where required–respectively the incremental and selective replacement strategies. I focus on the incremental approach, in terms of its implied causal mechanism. Two stages are involved, corresponding to the prediction of standard theory and to a separate component that aligns it with actual observations. In behavioural economics, one possible interpretation of the language of ‘biases’ is such a two-stage approach. More explicitly, Rabin advocates it in the form of PEEMs (Portable Extensions of Existing Models). A more direct, one-stage approach may have some advantages, at least for some research topics. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Joffe, M.",J. Econ.

Somebody may scold you! A dictator experiment,"In this contribution, we investigate the effects of observation-only and observation with feedback from a third-party in a one-shot dictator game (DG). In addition to a baseline condition (DG), a third-party anonymous subject was introduced who either silently observed or observed and got to give feedback by choosing one of seven messages consisting of varying degree of (dis)satisfaction. We found that observation coupled with feedback increased significantly dictators' propositions, while no significant effect is found for observation-only. We conclude that regard by others matters only if it linked to social factors such as communication. This complements the literature arguing that altruistic behavior is instrumental in serving other selfish (or non-purely altruistic) ends such as self-reputation or social approval. This experiment also contributes to the growing literature that aims at decreasing the artificiality of dictator game designs by increasing their practicability and external validity. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Festré, A.; Garrouste, P.",J.

Temporal Construal,"Construal level theory proposes that temporal distance changes people's responses to future events by changing the way people mentally represent those events. The greater the temporal distance, the more likely are events to be represented in terms of a few abstract features that convey the perceived essence of the events (high-level construals) rather than in terms of more concrete and incidental details of the events (low-level construals). The informational and evaluative implications of high-level construals, compared with those of low-level construals, should therefore have more impact on responses to distant-future events than near-future events. This article explores the implications of construal level theory for temporal changes in evaluation, prediction, and choice. The authors suggest that construal level underlies a broad range of evaluative and behavioral consequences of psychological distance from events.","Trope, Y.; Liberman, N.",Psychol. Rev.,391
On the interpretation of giving in dictator games,"The dictator game represents a workhorse within experimental economics, frequently used to test theory and to provide insights into the prevalence of social preferences. This study explores more closely the dictator game and the literature's preferred interpretation of its meaning by collecting data from nearly 200 dictators across treatments that varied the action set and the origin of endowment. The action set variation includes choices in which the dictator can ""take"" money from the other player. Empirical results question the received interpretation of dictator game giving: many fewer agents are willing to transfer money when the action set includes taking. Yet, a result that holds regardless of action set composition is that agents do not ubiquitously choose the most selfish outcome. The results have implications for theoretical models of social preferences, highlight that ""institutions"" matter a great deal, and point to useful avenues for future research using simple dictator games and relevant manipulations. © 2007 by The University of Chicago.

Tax prices and charitable giving: Projected changes in donations under the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act,"We estimate the tax price elasticity of charitable giving using newly available data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics spanning 2001–17. We find that households that always itemize are less sensitive to changes in the tax treatment of donations than households that switch itemizing status. We apply these results to the provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, taking into account the marginal propensity to donate from the increase in disposable income expected for most households, and we predict significant reductions in charitable giving. © 2020 by the National Bureau of Economic Research.

"Same numbers, different meanings: How numeracy influences the importance of numbers for pro-social behavior","Numerical information often serves as a basis for evaluations, decisions and behavior. In requests for charitable giving, three numerical cues in the donation description are of particular importance: the number of potential recipients of a donation, the total number of people in need, and their proportion. In three studies, we examined the effects of numeracy on the weight given to these numerical cues in donations. Study 1 contrasted the importance of a higher absolute number (of potential recipients and the number of people in need) vs. a higher proportion of recipients. In Study 2, we investigated the effects of the total number of people in need and Study 3 was designed to focus on the impact of the absolute number of potential recipients. Our results revealed a consistent pattern demonstrating that highly numerate individuals were willing to donate more for projects that offered assistance to the greatest proportion of recipients. Conversely, less numerate individuals were insensitive to this proportion; they tended to donate more with increases in both the number of recipients and the total number of people in need. The meaning of numbers in donation decisions and the resulting motivation to help depends on numeric skill. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","Kleber, J.; Dickert, S.; Peters, E.; Florack, A.",J. Exp. Soc.

Determinants of donations in private nonprofit markets,"We estimate the responsiveness of donations to a number of economic variables, including price, advertising, and the availability of revenue from such other sources as government grants and program service sales. Utilizing a set of IRS data on individual nonprofit organizations in each of seven industries - including hospitals and higher education - for the years 1982-1994, we find distinct overall patterns as well as notable variation across industries. A nonprofit organization's fundraising expenditures are estimated to exert two countervailing effects on donations - the direct, advertising and information, effect augments donations, while the indirect effect, on the 'price' of donating, has a negative effect. We do not find evidence that fundraising is carried to the profit-maximizing levels. In some industries fundraising is substantially short of that level, while in other industries it is excessive, implying that the marginal return to fundraising is exceeded by the cost. Focusing on whether revenue from other sources affects donations to a nonprofit organization, we find evidence that revenue from either government grants or from the organization's own program sales activity generally does not crowd-out private donations. To the contrary, in most industries there are significant positive effects. © Elsevier Science S.A.","Okten, C.; Weisbrod, B.A.",J. Public Econ.,396

A meta-analysis of the factors affecting eWOM providing behaviour,"Purpose: Numerous studies have examined factors influencing electronic word of mouth (eWOM) providing behaviour. The volume of extant research and inconsistency in some of the findings makes it useful to develop an all-encompassing model synthesising results. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to synthesise findings from existing studies on eWOM by using meta-analysis, which will help to reconcile conflicting findings of factors affecting consumers’ intention to engage in eWOM communications. Design/methodology/approach: The findings from 51 studies were used for meta-analysis, which was undertaken using comprehensive meta-analysis software. Findings: Factors affecting eWOM providing behaviour were divided into four groups: personal conditions, social conditions, perceptual conditions and consumption-based conditions. The results of the meta-analysis showed that out of 20 identified relationships, 16 were found to be significant (opinion seeking, information usefulness, trust in web eWOM services, economic incentive, customer satisfaction, loyalty, brand attitude, altruism, affective commitment, normative commitment, opinion leadership, self-enhancement, information influence, tie strength, homophily and community identity). Research limitations/implications: One of the limitations of this study is that the studies for this research were collected the only form from Web of Science, Scopus and Business Source such as databases, which result in a limited number of studies available for weight and meta-analysis. A wider range of databases should be used by future research. Also, this study only considered quantitative studies and excluded qualitative studies. Thus, future studies could include both types of studies in the meta-analysis. Practical implications: By focussing on the best predictors of intention to provide eWOM communications (e.g. self-enhancement and trust in web eWOM services) managers can improve reader engagement and information assimilation. Knowing motivations to engage in eWOM helps platform operators design their service in a more customer-oriented way. By better understanding motivations to engage in eWOM communications marketers and researchers can influence individuals’ online information assimilation which can affect consumer purchase decisions, customer loyalty and consumer commitment to the community. Originality/value: Applying meta-analysis helped the reconciliation of conflicting findings, enabled investigation of the strengths of the relationships between motivations and eWOM providing behaviour and offered a consolidated view. The results of this study facilitate the advancement of current knowledge of information dissemination on the internet, which can influence consumer purchase intention and loyalty. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Ismagilova, E.; Rana, N.P.; Slade, E.L.; Dwivedi, Y.K.",Eur.

Liking but Devaluing Animals: Emotional and Deliberative Paths to Speciesism,"We explore whether priming emotion versus deliberation affects speciesism—the tendency to prioritize certain individuals over others on the basis of their species membership (three main and two supplementary studies, four preregistered; N = 3,288). We find that the tendency to prioritize humans over animals (anthropocentric speciesism) decreases when participants were asked to think emotionally compared to deliberatively. In contrast, the tendency to prioritize dogs over other animals (pet speciesism) increases when participants were asked to think emotionally compared to deliberatively. We hypothesize that, emotionally, people like animals in general and dogs in particular; however, deliberatively, people attribute higher moral status to humans than animals and roughly equal status to dogs, chimpanzees, elephants, and pigs. In support of this explanation, participants tended to discriminate between animals based on likability when thinking emotionally and based on moral status when thinking deliberatively. These findings shed light on the psychological underpinnings of speciesism. © The Author(s) 2020.","Caviola, L.; Capraro, V.",Soc. Psychol. Pers. Sci,404
Effects of Government Support of Nonprofit Institutions on Aggregate Private Philanthropy: Evidence from 40 Countries,"This paper examines the effects of aggregate government payments to nonprofit organizations on aggregate private philanthropy. Four behavioral models of private philanthropic giving are proposed to formulate four hypotheses about those effects: no net effect (null hypothesis), crowding in (positive effect), crowding out (negative effect), and ""philanthropic flight"" or displacement (negative effect across different subsectors). These hypotheses were tested against the evidence from 40 countries collected as a part of a larger research project aimed to document the scale and finances of the nonprofit sector. The data show that, on the balance, government payments to nonprofit institutions (NPIs) have a positive effect on aggregate philanthropic donations to nonprofits, as stipulated by the crowding in hypothesis, but a field level analysis revealed evidence of ""philanthropic flight"" or displacement from ""service"" to ""expressive"" activities by government payments to ""service"" NPIs. Due to the limitations of the data, these results indicate empirical plausibility of the hypothesized effects rather than their incidence. The findings demonstrate the complexity of the relationship between government funding and philanthropic donations to nonprofits, which depends on the goals of the actors (donors and recipients) and institutional settings mediating the transaction costs of difference sources of nonprofit support. © 2012 International Society for Third-Sector Research and The John's Hopkins University.","Sokolowski, S.W.",Voluntas,405

The psychological evaluation of Samaritan kidney donors: a systematic review,"BACKGROUND: Living kidney donation to a loved one has become common practice. Another type of living donation that is becoming more acceptable to the transplant community is 'Samaritan donation'. Samaritan kidney donors are willing to donate to patients they do not know. Until recently there has been great reluctance to accept the offers of Samaritan donors because it was feared that these donors might be mentally unstable. METHOD: The purpose of this article is to review the literature about the psychological evaluation of potential Samaritan kidney donors for donor suitability. We have performed a systematic literature search in Pubmed, ISI Web of Science and PsycINFO. We compare and discuss how each study approaches the question about Samaritan donor selection. In addition, we have also screened the studies for reports of rejections of Samaritan donors on psychological grounds. RESULTS: We have found five articles that at least in some detail describe the evaluation of potential Samaritan donors. For all five articles found, a consultation with either a psychiatrist or a psychologist formed a standard part of the donor evaluation procedure. This evaluation consisted of an interview, and in most instances, additional psychometric testing. According to the articles found, the two major criteria for donor rejection were psychopathology/psychological instability and motivational issues. Three studies reported on the rejection of potential donors on psychological grounds. CONCLUSIONS: The evaluation of Samaritan kidney donors is a developing field in clinical medicine. Given the relatively low incidence of these types of donations, we recommend the exchange of experience between centres that run a Samaritan donor programme, in order to improve donor evaluation criteria.","Kranenburg, L; Zuidema, W; Erdman, R; Weimar, W; Passchier, J; Busschbach, J",Psychol.

Grooming and agonistic support: A meta-analysis of primate reciprocal altruism,"Grooming and agonistic support are 2 common primate behaviors that have been hypothesized to constitute examples of reciprocal altruism. In particular, because primates often direct their grooming up the dominance hierarchy, it has been suggested that they may exchange grooming for agonistic support. Empirical tests of this hypothesis have resulted in highly inconsistent findings. I synthesized the published literature on the relation between grooming and agonistic support in primates using modern meta-analytical techniques. A meta-analysis of 36 studies carried out on 14 different species showed that a significant positive relation exists between grooming and agonistic support (weighted average r = 0.154, corrected for publication bias). These findings suggest that grooming and agonistic support may have evolved as part of a system of low-cost reciprocal altruism. They also highlight the potential of meta-analysis in tackling the study of behavioral phenomena characterized by low overall frequency and small effect sizes. © The Author 2006.

Time Pressure and In-group Favoritism in a Minimal Group Paradigm,"Based on the group heuristic model and the model of intuitive cooperation, we hypothesized that in-group favoritism would be conspicuously shown through an intuitive process. To test this hypothesis, we utilized a minimal group paradigm, which is traditionally used in social psychological studies, and manipulated decision time in a one-shot prisoner’s dilemma game to compare the cooperative contribution level toward in-group and out-group members under three conditions: intuitive, empathic deliberation, and rational deliberation. Our findings confirmed that in-group favoritism was clearly shown in the intuitive condition only, suggesting that the intuitive cooperation model may only be valid in the context of social exchange with in-group members. Additional analysis also showed that in-group favoritism disappeared for participants who had been forced into empathic or rational deliberation for decision making. The theoretical implications of the findings are discussed. © Copyright © 2020 Maeda and Hashimoto.","Maeda, K.; Hashimoto, H.",Front. Psychol.,414

"The watching eyes effect in the Dictator Game: it's not how much you give, it's being seen to give something","In a classic study, Haley and Fessler showed that displaying subtle eye-like stimuli caused participants to behave more generously in the Dictator Game. Since their paper was published, there have been both successful replications and null results reported in the literature. However, it is important to clarify that two logically separable effects were found in their original experiment: watching eyes made the mean donation higher, and also increased the probability of donating something rather than nothing. Here, we report a replication study with 118 participants, in which we found that watching eyes significantly increased the probability of donating something, but did not increase the mean donation. Results did not depend on the sex of the participants or the sex of the eyes. We also present a meta-analysis of the seven studies of watching eye effects in the Dictator Game published to date. Combined, these studies total 887 participants, and show that although watching eyes do not reliably increase mean donations, they do reliably increase the probability of donating something rather than nothing (combined odds ratio 1.39). We conclude that the watching eyes effect in the Dictator Game is robust, but its interpretation may require refinement. Rather than making people directionally more generous, it may be that watching eyes reduce variation in social behavior.

Obligations and cooperative behaviour in public good games,"Laws express rules of conduct ('obligations') enforced by the means of penalties and rewards ('incentives'). The role of incentives in shaping individual behaviour has been largely analysed in the traditional economic literature. On the contrary, very little is known about the specific role of obligations. In this paper we test whether or not obligations have any independent effect on cooperation in a public good game. The results show that, for given marginal incentives, different levels of minimum contribution required by obligation determine significantly different levels of average contributions. Moreover, obligations per se cannot sustain cooperation over time, even if they affect the rate of decline of average contributions. Finally, unexpected changes in the minimum contribution have asymmetric dynamic effects on the levels of cooperation: a reduction does not alter the descending trend of cooperation, whereas an increase induces a temporary re-start in average contributions. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Enhancement in dopamine reduces generous behaviour in women,"Generosity is a human behavior common in social contexts. However, humans are not equally generous to everyone alike. Instead, generosity decreases as a function of social distance, an effect called social discounting. Studies show that such social discounting effect depends on diverse factors including personality traits, cultures, stress or hormonal levels. Recently, the importance of the neurotransmitter dopamine in regulating social interactions has been highlighted. However, it remains unclear how exactly dopamine agonist administration modulates generous behavior as a function of social discounting. Here, we investigate the causal effect of dopamine agonist administration on social discounting in a pharmacological intervention study. We employ a randomized, double-blind, within-subject design to investigate the impact of the D2/D3 receptor agonist pramipexole on social discounting by keeping gender constant. We apply hyperbolic social discount model to the data and provide evidence that women under pramipexole become less generous in general, especially towards close others. Our results highlight the crucial role of dopamine in social decision making. © 2019 Oroz Artigas et al.

Parent Empowerment in Pediatric Healthcare Settings: A Systematic Review of Observational Studies,"BACKGROUND: Parent empowerment is often an expressed goal in clinical pediatrics and in pediatric research, but the antecedents and consequences of parent empowerment are not well established. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this systematic review was to synthesize potential antecedents and consequences of parent empowerment in healthcare settings. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: The inclusion criteria were (1) studies with results about parent empowerment in the context of children's healthcare or healthcare providers; and (2) qualitative studies, observational studies, and systematic reviews of such studies. INFORMATION SOURCES: We searched the databases of PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar (2006-2017) and reference lists. INCLUDED STUDIES: Forty-four articles met the inclusion criteria. SYNTHESIS OF RESULTS: We identified six themes within consequences of empowerment: increased parent involvement in daily care, improved symptom management, enhanced informational needs and tools, increased involvement in care decisions, increased advocacy for child, and engagement in empowering others. Six themes summarizing antecedents of empowerment also emerged: parent-provider relationships, processes of care, experiences with medical care, experiences with community services, receiving informational/emotional support, and building personal capacity and narrative. We synthesized these findings into a conceptual model to guide future intervention development and evaluation. STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF EVIDENCE: Non-English articles were excluded. INTERPRETATION: Parent empowerment may enhance parent involvement in daily care and care decisions, improve child symptoms, enhance informational needs and skills, and increase advocacy and altruistic behaviors. Parent empowerment may be promoted by the parent-provider relationship and care processes, finding the right fit of medical and community services, and attention to the cognitive and emotional needs of parents.

Not published is not perished: Addressing publication bias in meta-analytic studies in communication,"Publication bias has been recognized as a threat to the validity of meta-analytic findings and scientific knowledge in general. Given the recent rise in meta-analytic research in communication, how well publication bias concerns are addressed by communication meta-analysts merits attention. In this essay, after a brief overview of publication bias and some major methods of assessment, we provide a systematic review of meta-analyses published in six major communication journals between 2005 and 2018. The review focuses on two aspects of addressing publication bias in meta-analyses: (a) reducing the potential impact of bias via an inclusive literature search; and (b) empirically assessing the extent and impact of bias in meta-analytic findings. Our review shows that the current practices in communication meta-analyses are inadequate in both aspects. We offer recommendations on ways of improving practices in meta-analyses, as well as in research and publication processes, to better safeguard knowledge claims. © The Author(s) 2020.

Early reputation management: Three-year-old children are more generous following exposure to eyes,"To enhance their reputations, adults and even 5-year-old children behave more prosocially when being observed by others. However, it remains unknown whether children younger than five also manage their reputations. One established paradigm for assessing reputation management is the 'watching eyes paradigm,' in which adults have been found to be more prosocial in the presence of eyes versus control images. However, the robustness of this effect in adults has recently been called into question, and it has never been demonstrated in children. In Study 1, we used a method similar to that used in prior work: 3-and 5-year-old children took part in a prosocial task while in the presence of an image of eyes or flowers but without explicit mention or reference to the image. With this method, children did not show the watching eyes effect. In Study 2, 3-year-old children were tested with a modified watching eyes paradigm, wherein they first explicitly interacted either with images of eyes or with cloth flowers, and they then engaged in a prosocial task. With this modified watching eyes paradigm, 3-year-olds showed the predicted effect: They were more prosocial following exposure to eyes than flowers. These results offer potential insight into the mixed findings across the adult literature, such that the manner of exposure, and specifically how explicit the exposure is, may influence the watching eyes effect. Finally, no study to date has examined whether cues of human presence other than the eyes also influence prosociality. We found that children in the Mouth condition were prosocial at an intermediate level between the Eyes and Flowers conditions.

Advancing towards contemporary practice: a systematic review of organisational performance measures for non-acute health charities,"BACKGROUND: Organisational performance measurement is a recognised business management tool and essential for survival and success. There is a paucity of methodological studies of organisational performance measurement relating to non-acute healthcare charities and this study is the first to suggest a set of evidence-informed organisational performance measures for the sector. METHODS: This study was designed using a two-staged approach. A systematic review of peer-reviewed journal literature between 2003 and 2016 was conducted according to the twenty-seven (27) point checklist of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) complemented by a thematic analysis of eligible data using a cutting and sorting technique to generate a set of common measures of organisational performance for non-acute health charities. RESULTS: Not one study was found relating to organisational performance of non-acute healthcare charities however four records met eligibility criteria relating to non-acute or primary healthcare services with charitable fundraising capability. Three were case studies of specific organisations that related their approach to organisational performance measurement, while the fourth compared a case study organisation to a public service. Three different organisational performance frameworks and 20 organisational performance measures were used across the four studies. CONCLUSIONS: The study concluded that (1) demonstration of organisational performance is relevant to non-acute health charities; (2) organisational performance measurement is feasible in this sector; (3) an evidence-based organisational performance measurement framework for the sector has not yet been developed nor has an existing organisational performance measurement framework been adapted for the sector, although the Balanced Scorecard is likely to be an effective option and (4) five leading measures - Quality of Service; Finance; Stakeholders (Customers and Clients); People and Culture; and Governance and Business Management; could be used to determine organisational performance in these sectors. Finally, 'Mission and Purpose' could be explored as a potential measure. Further research to understand why there is such limited published organisational performance evidence for the sector could be useful. Case studies of organisational measurement strategies of successful non-acute healthcare charities and research into important factors for organisational performance implementation in the sector may contribute to greater uptake and knowledge dissemination.","Colbran, Richard; Ramsden, Robyn; Stagnitti, Karen; Toumbourou, John W",BMC Health Serv.

Pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions for cough in adults with respiratory and non-respiratory diseases: a systematic review of the literature,"The authors stated that the evidence was limited. Many trials had conflicting results and were hindered by variable quality scores and small sample sizes. XCM: The review was broad in scope with regard to the interventions of interest, but the inclusion criteria were more focused in terms of study design, participants and outcomes. Most outcomes were reported to be unvalidated measures, which conflicted with the inclusion criteria. The search strategy was extensive and included several relevant electronic databases. Attempts were made to minimise publication bias. Language bias was a possibility. The chosen quality assessment tool was appropriate for the included study designs. More than half of the trials indicated a reasonable quality standard, but presentation of composite scores limits further interpretation. Some attempts were made to minimise error and bias in the review process. Sufficient study details were available to enable judgement about wide clinical variation, and thus the appropriateness of the chosen method of synthesis. Despite the conflict with inclusion criteria, the authors' conclusion is likely to be reliable. XIM: Practice: The authors did not state any implications for practice.Research: The authors stated that future research was needed into cough management, with cough measured as the primary outcome using validated subjective and objective methods. Clinical heterogeneity should be minimised. Further evaluation of speech therapy as an adjunct to pharmacological treatments was warranted.","Molassiotis, A; Bryan, G; Caress, A; Bailey, C; Smith, J",,427
Do charitable donors know enough - And care enough - About government subsidies to affect private giving to nonprofit organizations?,"A large body of research has examined the effect of government subsidies to nonprofit organizations on philanthropy, with the preponderance of evidence suggesting that government funding partially displaces or ""crowds out"" private giving. Such studies assume that charitable donors are aware of the amount of government funding received by their beneficiary charitable organizations and that they act on this information when determining how much money to donate. This study assesses the validity of these heretofore untested assumptions. After comparing the ""best guesses"" of survey respondents (N = 675) to the actual amount of government funding received by the charitable organizations to which they have donated money, the assumption of donors' knowledge about government funding is found to be met only very weakly, furthermore, few respondents anticipate changing giving behavior due to government subsidies. These findings suggest the need to explore explanations of crowding out beyond those assumed under current theory.","Horne, C.S.; Johnson, J.L.; Van Slyke, D.M.",Nonprofit Volunt. Sect. Q.,428

Human cooperation,"Why should you help a competitor? Why should you contribute to the public good if free riders reap the benefits of your generosity? Cooperation in a competitive world is a conundrum. Natural selection opposes the evolution of cooperation unless specific mechanisms are at work. Five such mechanisms have been proposed: direct reciprocity, indirect reciprocity, spatial selection, multilevel selection, and kin selection. Here we discuss empirical evidence from laboratory experiments and field studies of human interactions for each mechanism. We also consider cooperation in one-shot, anonymous interactions for which no mechanisms are apparent. We argue that this behavior reflects the overgeneralization of cooperative strategies learned in the context of direct and indirect reciprocity: we show that automatic, intuitive responses favor cooperative strategies that reciprocate. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Rand, D.G.; Nowak, M.A.",Trends Cogn.

Attitudes to deceased organ donation and registration as a donor among minority ethnic groups in North America and the U.K.: a synthesis of quantitative and qualitative research,"OBJECTIVES: A systematic review and synthesis of quantitative and qualitative research were undertaken to examine attitudes to deceased donation and registration as an organ donor among ethnic minorities in the U.K. and North America. DESIGN: A systematic search and assessments of relevance and quality were conducted. Parallel syntheses were then undertaken of 14 quantitative and 12 qualitative papers followed by their integration. The synthesis was organised around five barriers that emerged as key issues: (1) knowledge regarding deceased donation and registration as a donor; (2) discussion of donation/registration with family members; (3) faith and cultural beliefs; (4) bodily concerns including disfigurement and intactness; and (5) trust in doctors and the health care system. RESULTS: In all countries, knowledge of organ donation and registration remained low despite public campaigns, with African-Americans and Black African and Black Caribbean populations in the U.K. often regarding organ donation as a 'white' issue. Each of the four attitudinal barriers was also more prevalent among ethnic minorities compared with the majority population. However, the significance of trust and uncertainties regarding religion/faith differed between groups, reflecting salient aspects of ethnic identity and experiences. Differences were also identified within ethnic groups associated with age and generation, although respect for the views of elders often influenced younger peoples' willingness to donate. CONCLUSION: There is a need for a more nuanced understanding of ethnicity and of variations in attitudes associated with country of origin, age/generation, socio-economic status and area of residence, to inform public campaigns and promote sensitive discussions with bereaved ethnic minority families. The traditional focus on knowledge and attitudes also requires to be complemented by a greater emphasis on organisational and service-related barriers and changes required to enhance ethnic minorities' access to registration as a donor and consent to deceased donation.","Morgan, Myfanwy; Kenten, Charlotte; Deedat, Sarah; Donate Programme Team",Ethn.

A Methodological Review of the Assessment of Humanism in Medical Students,"BACKGROUND: Humanism is a complex construct that defies simplistic measurement. How educators measure humanism shapes understanding and implications for learners. This systematic review sought to address the following questions: How do medical educators assess humanism in medical students, and how does the measurement impact the understanding of humanism in undergraduate medical education (UME)? METHOD: Using the IECARES (integrity, excellence, compassion, altruism, respect, empathy, and service) Gold Foundation framework, a search of English literature databases from 2000 to 2013 on assessment of humanism in medical students revealed more than 900 articles, of which 155 met criteria for analysis. Using descriptive statistics, articles and assessments were analyzed for construct measured, study design, assessment method, instrument type, perspective/source of assessment, student level, validity evidence, and national context. RESULTS: Of 202 assessments reported in 155 articles, 162 (80%) used surveys; 164 (81%) used student self-reports. One hundred nine articles (70%) included only one humanism construct. Empathy was the most prevalent construct present in 96 (62%); 49 (51%) of those used a single instrument. One hundred fifteen (74%) used exclusively quantitative data; only 48 (31%) used a longitudinal design. Construct underrepresentation was identified as a threat to validity in half of the assessments. Articles included 34 countries; 87 (56%) were from North America. CONCLUSIONS: Assessment of humanism in UME incorporates a limited scope of a complex construct, often relying on single quantitative measures from self-reported survey instruments. This highlights the need for multiple methods, perspectives, and longitudinal designs to strengthen the validity of humanism assessments.","Buck, Era; Holden, Mark; Szauter, Karen",Acad. Med.,432

We discuss the individual value perception and explain why we decided to test a non-monetary reward against the standard low stake monetary reward. We demonstrate that the value systems based on two different, inconvertible currencies lead to different decision rates in the same population. We provide the details of our single blind randomized protocol and discuss other protocol modifications designed to demonstrate the variability of the offer and/or response rates in the Ultimatum games. We provide our concept of rational, non-rational and irrational components contributing to the decision making process in different accord depending on the individual perception of the reward value and confront our experimental findings with the key assumptions provided by other authors.","Fiala, J.; Starý, O.; Fialová, M.; Holasová, A.; Mejzlíková, T.; Bemš, J.",Ekon.

Do high stakes and competition undermine fair behaviour? Evidence from Russia,"This paper reports the results of a series of competitive labour market experiments in which subjects have the possibility to reciprocate favours. In the high stake condition subjects earned between two and three times their monthly income during the experiment. In the normal stake condition the stake level was reduced by a factor of ten. We observe that both in the high and the normal stake condition fairness concerns are strong enough to outweigh competitive forces and give rise to non-competitive wages. There is also no evidence that effort behaviour becomes generally more selfish at higher stake levels. Therefore, our results suggest that fairness concerns may play an important role even at relatively high stake levels. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Fehr, E.; Tougareva, E.; Fischbacher, U.",J. Econ. Behav.

"Sharing is daring: An experiment on consent, chilling effects and a salient privacy nudge","Privacy law rests on the assumption that government surveillance may increase the general level of conformity and thus generate a chilling effect. In a study that combines elements of a lab and a field experiment, we show that salient and incentivized consent options are sufficient to trigger this behavioral effect. Salient ex ante consent options may lure people into giving up their privacy and increase their compliance with social norms – even when the only immediate risk of sharing information is mere publicity on a Google website. A right to be forgotten (right to deletion), however, seems to reduce neither privacy valuations nor chilling effects. In spite of low deletion costs people tend to stick with a retention default. The study suggests that consent architectures may play out on social conformity rather than on consent choices and privacy valuations. Salient notice and consent options may not merely empower users to make an informed consent decision. Instead, they can trigger the very effects that privacy law intends to curb. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Hermstrüwer, Y.; Dickert, S.",Int. Rev. Law. Econ.,440
"A systematic review of social, economic and diplomatic aspects of short-term medical missions","BACKGROUND: Short-term medical missions (STMMs) represent a grass-roots form of aid, transferring medical services rather than funds or equipment. The objective of this paper is to review empirical studies on social, economic and diplomatic aspects of STMMs. METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted by searching PubMed and EBSCOhost for articles published from 1947-2014 about medical missions to lower and middle income countries (LMICs). Publications focused on military, disaster and dental service trips were excluded. A data extraction process was used to identify publications relevant to our objective stated above. RESULTS: PubMed and EBSCOhost searches provided 4138 and 3262 articles respectively for review. Most articles that provide useful information have appeared in the current millennium and are found in focused surgical journals. Little attention is paid to aspects of volunteerism, altruism and philanthropy related to STMM activity in the literature reviewed (1 article). Evidence of professionalization remains scarce, although elements including guidelines and tactical instructions have been emerging (27 articles). Information on costs (10 articles) and commentary on the relevance of market forces (1 article) are limited. Analyses of spill-over effects, i.e., changing attitudes of physicians or their communities towards aid, and characterizations of STMMs as meaningful foreign aid or strategic diplomacy are few (4 articles). CONCLUSIONS: The literature on key social, economic and diplomatic aspects of STMMs and their consequences is sparse. Guidelines, tactical instructions and attempts at outcome measures are emerging that may better professionalize the otherwise unregulated activity. A broader discussion of these key aspects may lead to improved accountability and intercultural professionalism to accompany medical professionalism in STMM activity.","Caldron, Paul H; Impens, Ann; Pavlova, Milena; Groot, Wim",BMC Health Serv.

A virtue ethics critique of ethical dimensions of behavioral economics: Comments from a behavioral economist,"In “A Virtue Ethics Critique of Ethical Dimensions of Behavioral Economics,” Professor Daryl Koehn criticizes the field of behavioral economics. She argues that behavioral economists ignore many important factors that affect how people make decisions, that their results are derived from experiments where subjects make choices in overly restrictive, artificial, and thin contexts that do not capture the richness of reality, and that the approach brings up psychological motivations that affect behavior in a piecemeal, ad hoc way that does not capture the overall tapestry of the factors that influence the choices that we make. In this comment, I offer responses to many of these criticisms, and note where I think we have common ground. © 2020 W.

Comparing meta-analytic moderator estimation techniques under realistic conditions.,"One of the most problematic issues in contemporary meta-analysis is the estimation and interpretation of moderating effects. Monte Carlo analyses are developed in this article that compare bivariate correlations, ordinary least squares and weighted least squares (WLS) multiple regression, and hierarchical subgroup (HS) analysis for assessing the influence of continuous moderators under conditions of multicollinearity and skewed distribution of study sample sizes (heteroscedasticity). The results show that only WLS is largely unaffected by multicollinearity and heteroscedasticity, whereas the other techniques are substantially weakened. Of note, HS, one of the most popular methods, typically provides the most inaccurate results, whereas WLS, one of the least popular methods, typically provides the most accurate results.","Steel, P.D.; Kammeyer-Mueller, J.D.",J Appl Psychol,443
Religious attitudes and prosocial behavior: a systematic review of published research,"One of the most profound questions in the scientific study of religion is whether or not religion evolved because of its ability to stimulate cooperation, in the sense of in-group mutual help. Historical evidence bearing on this fundamental question is scarce and inconclusive. Relevant empirical and experimental studies have often shown an association between religious variables and the promotion of collaborative attitudes, and sometimes a causal link from religion to cooperation. This study evaluates the quality of the evidence gathered to date. After reviewing previously published theoretical, empirical non-experimental, experimental, experimental-priming, meta-analytic, and hybrid studies, I identify difficulties with current research methodologies, including the lack of standard procedures. I conclude by drawing such conclusions as the existing literature permits regarding the link between religion and prosociality, arguing that religion needs to be understood not as needing to produce prosociality to appear, survive, and develop; but as emerging, surviving, and developing in a complex partnership with moral attitudes and behaviors. © 2015 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Oviedo, Lluis",Religion Brain Behav.,444
The norm-dependent effect of watching eyes on donation,"Although many previous studies have shown that eye-like images promote generosity, the mechanism of this “watching eyes effect” remains unclear. One possible cause is the concern for a good reputation as a generous person, while the other is the concerns for a bad reputation as a norm violator. To elucidate which of these two concerns is the main influencer, the present study conducted a laboratory experiment that investigated whether the watching eyes effect changed depending on social norms. If the concern for a good reputation leads to the effect, prosocial behavior would be more likely in the presence of watching eyes, regardless of the social norms involved. However, if the concern for avoiding a bad reputation as a norm violator leads to the effect, watching eyes promote prosocial behavior only in the existence of prosocial norms. In the original study, participants were asked to make a charitable donation under conditions in which eye-like images either were or were not present. In addition to the eye-like images, we manipulated prosocial norms by informing each participant of either high or low mean donation amounts given by previous participants. We found that watching eyes promoted donations only when a prosocial norm existed. This supports the idea that the watching eyes effect is caused by a concern for avoiding a bad reputation from violating norms. However, in a replication study, we were unable to replicate the original results; watching eyes did not promote generosity regardless of the norm. Taken together, we discussed the moderation effect of norms and the possibility of other moderators. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Kawamura, Y.; Kusumi, T.",Evol. Hum. Behav.,445
Rendered invisible? The absent presence of egg providers in U.K. debates on the acceptability of research and therapy for mitochondrial disease,"Techniques for resolving some types of inherited mitochondrial diseases have recently been the subject of scientific research, ethical scrutiny, media coverage and regulatory initiatives in the UK. Building on research using eggs from a variety of providers, scientists hope to eradicate maternally transmitted mutations in mitochondrial DNA by transferring the nuclear DNA of a fertilised egg, created by an intending mother at risk of transmitting mitochondrial disease, and her male partner, into an enucleated egg provided by another woman. In this article we examine how egg providers for mitochondrial research and therapy have been represented in stakeholder debates. A systematic review of key documents and parliamentary debates shows that the balance of consideration tilts heavily towards therapeutic egg providers; research egg providers have been ignored and rendered invisible. However, mapping the various designations of therapeutic egg providers shows that their role is so heavily camouflaged that they have only an absent presence in discussions. We explore this puzzling ambivalence towards egg providers whose contributions are necessary to the success of current mitochondrial research and proposed therapies. We suggest that labels that diminish the contributions of egg providers serve certain governance objectives in managing possible future claims about, and by, therapeutic egg providers. We demonstrate that the social positioning of research egg providers is entangled within that of therapeutic egg providers which means that the former can also never receive their due recognition. This article contributes to the wider literature on the governance of new technological interventions.","Haimes, Erica; Taylor, Ken",Monash Bioeth. Rev.,446
Total disc replacement surgery for symptomatic degenerative lumbar disc disease: a systematic review of the literature,"The evidence, specifically for long-term effectiveness and/or safety, was insufficient to justify widespread use of total disc replacement over fusion for single-level degenerative disc. XCM: The review addressed a clear research question and was supported by adequate inclusion criteria. There was an attempt to reduce language bias by including studies in German and Dutch in addition to English. No attempts were made to locate unpublished material, which meant that relevant studies may have been missed. An appropriate tool was used for evaluating RCT quality. Details of primary studies were provided. It was appropriate that a narrative synthesis was used given the limited number of studies and heterogeneity in the interventions and comparators. The review process was carried out with sufficient attempts to minimise reviewer error and bias. The authors' conclusions reflect the limited evidence presented and are likely to be reliable. XIM: Practice: The authors stated that it was recommended that disc replacement surgery at this time was performed only within prospective scientific studies until further documentation of its efficiency was provided. Research: The authors stated that high-quality RCTs with relevant control groups, long-term follow-up and full economic evaluation and assessment of the longevity of the prostheses were needed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of total disc replacement.","van den Eerenbeemt, K D; Ostelo, R W; van Royen, B J; Peul, W C; van Tulder, M W",,447
Assessing the validity of the Self versus other interest implicit association test,"There is great variability in the ways that humans treat one another, ranging from extreme compassion (e.g., philanthropy, organ donation) to self-interested cruelty (e.g., theft, murder). What underlies and explains this variability? Past research has primarily examined human prosociality using explicit self-report scales, which are susceptible to self-presentation biases. However, these concerns can be alleviated with the use of implicit attitude tests that assess automatic associations. Here, we introduce and assess the validity of a new test of implicit prosociality–the Self versus Other Interest Implicit Association Test (SOI-IAT)–administered to two samples in pre-registered studies: regular blood donors (Study 1; N = 153) and a nationally representative sample of Americans (Study 2; N = 467). To assess validity, we investigated whether SOI-IAT scores were correlated with explicit measures of prosociality within each sample and compared SOI-IAT scores of the control sample (representative sample of Americans) with the prosocial sample (blood donors). While SOI-IAT scores were higher in the prosocial blood donor sample, SOI-IAT scores were generally uncorrelated with explicit measures and actual prosocial behaviour. Thus, the SOI-IAT may be able to detect group differences in everyday prosociality, but future testing is needed for a more robust validation of the SOI-IAT. These unexpected findings underscore the importance of sharing null and mixed results to fill gaps in the scientific record and highlight the challenges of conducting research on implicit processes. © 2020 Thornton, Aknin.

Matching grants and charitable giving: Why people sometimes provide a helping hand to fund environmental goods,"Matching grants are a prevalent mechanism for funding environmental, conservation, and natural resource projects. However, economists have largely been silent regarding the potential benefits of these mechanisms at increasing voluntary contributions. To examine the behavioral responses to different match levels, this research uses controlled laboratory experiments with generically framed instructions and introduces a general-form matching-grant mechanism, referred to as the proportional contribution mechanism (PCM). Results show that contributions are positively correlated with both the match and the induced value of the public good even when a dominant strategy is free-riding. An implication of this partial demand revelation result is that manifestations of this type of ""helping hand"" social preference should be counted in benefit-cost analysis.

Source of funding and results of studies of health effects of mobile phone use: systematic review of experimental studies,"OBJECTIVES: There is concern regarding the possible health effects of cellular telephone use. We examined whether the source of funding of studies of the effects of low-level radiofrequency radiation is associated with the results of studies. We conducted a systematic review of studies of controlled exposure to radiofrequency radiation with health-related outcomes (electroencephalogram, cognitive or cardiovascular function, hormone levels, symptoms, and subjective well-being). DATA SOURCES: We searched EMBASE, Medline, and a specialist database in February 2005 and scrutinized reference lists from relevant publications. DATA EXTRACTION: Data on the source of funding, study design, methodologic quality, and other study characteristics were extracted. The primary outcome was the reporting of at least one statistically significant association between the exposure and a health-related outcome. Data were analyzed using logistic regression models. DATA SYNTHESIS: Of 59 studies, 12 (20%) were funded exclusively by the telecommunications industry, 11 (19%) were funded by public agencies or charities, 14 (24%) had mixed funding (including industry), and in 22 (37%) the source of funding was not reported. Studies funded exclusively by industry reported the largest number of outcomes, but were least likely to report a statistically significant result: The odds ratio was 0.11 (95% confidence interval, 0.02-0.78), compared with studies funded by public agencies or charities. This finding was not materially altered in analyses adjusted for the number of outcomes reported, study quality, and other factors. CONCLUSIONS: The interpretation of results from studies of health effects of radiofrequency radiation should take sponsorship into account.","Huss, Anke; Egger, Mathias; Hug, Kerstin; Huwiler-Müntener, Karin; Röösli, Martin",Cien.

Directed giving: Evidence from an inter-household transfer experiment,"We investigate the determinants of giving in a lab-in-the-field experiment with large stakes. Study participants in urban Mozambique play dictator games where their counterpart is the closest person to them outside their household. When given the option, dictators do a large fraction of giving in kind (in the form of goods) rather than cash. In addition, they share more in total when they have the option of giving in kind, compared to giving that can only be in cash. Qualitative post-experiment responses suggest that this effect is driven by a desire to control how recipients use gifted resources. Standard economic determinants such as the rate of return to giving and the size of the endowment also affect giving, but the effects of even large changes in these determinants are significantly smaller than the effect of the in-kind option. Our results support theories of giving where the utility of givers depends on the composition (not just the level) of gift-recipient expenditures, and givers thus seek control over transferred resources. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Batista, C.; Silverman, D.; Yang, D.",J.

On the private provision of public goods,"We consider a general model of the non-cooperative provision of a public good. Under very weak assumptions there will always exist a unique Nash equilibrium in our model. A small redistribution of wealth among the contributing consumers will not change the equilibrium amount of the public good. However, larger redistributions of wealth will change the set of contributors and thereby change the equilibrium provision of the public good. We are able to characterize the properties and the comparative statics of the equilibrium in a quite complete way and to analyze the extent to which government provision of a public good 'crowds out' private contributions. © 1986.","Bergstrom, T.; Blume, L.; Varian, H.",J.

One-shot reciprocity under error management is unbiased and fragile,"The error management model of altruism in one-shot interactions provides an influential explanation for one of the most controversial behaviors in evolutionary social science. The model posits that one-shot altruism arises from a domain-specific cognitive bias that avoids the error of mistaking a long-term relationship for a one-shot interaction. One-shot altruism is thus, in an intriguingly paradoxical way, a form of reciprocity. We examine the logic behind this idea in detail. In its most general form the error management model is exceedingly flexible, and restrictions about the psychology of agents are necessary for selection to be well-defined. Once these restrictions are in place, selection is well defined, but it leads to behavior that is perfectly consistent with an unbiased rational benchmark. Thus, the evolution of one-shot reciprocity does not require an evoked cognitive bias based on repeated interactions and reputation. Moreover, in spite of its flexibility in terms of psychology, the error management model assumes that behavior is exceedingly rigid when individuals face a new interaction partner. Reciprocity can only take the form of tit-for-tat, and individuals cannot adjust their behavior in response to new information about the duration of a relationship. Zefferman (2014) showed that one-shot reciprocity does not reliably evolve if one relaxes the first restriction, and we show that the behavior does not reliably evolve if one relaxes the second restriction. Altogether, these theoretical results on one-shot reciprocity do not square well with experiments showing increased altruism in the presence of payoff-irrelevant stimuli that suggest others are watching. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Zimmermann, J.; Efferson, C.",Evol.

The tax treatment of charitable contributions in a personal income tax: Lessons from theory and the Canadian experience,"Introduction A hundred years after tax concessions for charitable contributions were introduced as part of the personal income taxes that many countries enacted during the First World War, these countries continue to debate the appropriate level and structure of tax concessions for charitable gifts. In Australia, where the Income Tax Assessment Act 1915 (Cth) included a deduction for donations to ‘public charitable institutions’, recent reviews have considered replacing the deduction with tax rebates (or credits) or matching grants. In the United States, which introduced a charitable deduction in the War Revenue Act of 1917, recent proposals include limiting the maximum marginal rate at which charitable contributions may be deducted, replacing the deduction with a credit, or converting the credit into a matching grant programme. And in Canada, where a deduction for specific categories of charitable contributions was included in the income tax introduced in 1917, the deduction was converted into a non-refundable credit in 1988, while more recent reforms have encouraged gifts of capital assets by exempting certain gifts of property from tax on capital gains and increasing income-related ceilings on the amount that individual taxpayers may claim in respect of charitable gifts.This chapter considers the tax treatment of charitable contributions in a personal income tax. The next section reviews and evaluates alternative rationales for tax recognition of charitable gifts and the implications of these rationales for the form that tax recognition should take. The section entitled ‘The Canadian experience’ examines recent experience in Canada, evaluating recent legislative reforms in light of the rationales discussed in the preceding section. © Cambridge University Press 2014.","Duff, D.G.",Not-for-Profit Law: Theoretical and Comparative Perspectives,462
Eye tracker as an implied social presence: Awareness of being eye-tracked induces social-norm-based looking behaviour,"Human behaviour is not only influenced by the physical presence of others, but also implied social presence. This study examines the impact of awareness of being eye-tracked on eye movement behaviour in a laboratory setting. During a classic yes/no face recognition task, participants were made to believe that their eye movements were recorded (or not recorded) by eye trackers. Their looking patterns with and without the awareness of being eye-tracked were compared while perceiving social (faces, faces-and-bodies) and non-social (inanimate objects) video stimuli. Area-of-interest (AOI) analysis revealed that misinformed participants (who were not aware that their eye movements were being recorded) looked more at the body (chest and waist) compared to informed participants (who believed they were being eye-tracked), whereas informed participants fixated longer on the mouth and shorter on the eyes of female models than misinformed participants did. These findings highlight the potential impact of an awareness of being eye tracked on one's eye movement pattern when perceiving a social stimulus. We conclude that even within laboratory settings an eye tracker may function as an implied social presence that leads individuals to modify their eye movement behaviour according to socially-derived inhibitory norms. © 2019 International Group for Eye Movement Research.","Wong, H.K.; Stephen, I.D.",J.

Raising the stakes in the ultimatum game: Experimental evidence from Indonesia,"The ultimatum game has generated considerable interest because experimental evidence strongly rejects the standard game-theoretic predictions. A limitation to this general result is the possibility that experimental results are an artifact of small stakes. Implementing the ultimatum game in Indonesia makes it possible to raise the stakes to three times the monthly expenditure of the average participant. Even with these sizable incentives, results do not uniformly approach the sub-game perfect, selfish outcomes. More specifically, responders become more willing to accept a given percentage offer at higher stakes, but proposer behavior is largely invariant to stake changes.

The evolution of religion and morality: a synthesis of ethnographic and experimental evidence from eight societies,"Understanding the expansion of human sociality and cooperation beyond kith and kin remains an important evolutionary puzzle. There is likely a complex web of processes including institutions, norms, and practices that contributes to this phenomenon. Considerable evidence suggests that one such process involves certain components of religious systems that may have fostered the expansion of human cooperation in a variety of ways, including both certain forms of rituals and commitment to particular types of gods. Using an experimental economic game, our team specifically tested whether or not individually held mental models of moralistic, punishing, and knowledgeable gods curb biases in favor of the self and the local community, and increase impartiality toward geographically distant anonymous co-religionists. Our sample includes 591 participants from eight diverse societies–iTaukei (indigenous) Fijians who practice both Christianity and ancestor worship, the animist Hadza of Tanzania, Hindu Indo-Fijians, Hindu Mauritians, shamanist-Buddhist Tyvans of southern Siberia, traditional Inland and Christian Coastal Vanuatuans from Tanna, and Christian Brazilians from Pesqueiro.

Legitimizing Paltry Contributions: Testing Indirect Effects,"This study was conducted to determine the mechanisms through which legitimizing paltry contributions (LPC) indirectly influences individuals’ likelihood of donating to charitable organizations. Three potential mediators were considered. After being solicited online, 1,035 participants reacted to one of four hypothetical scenarios distributed at random. Results indicated that LPC requests indirectly influenced individuals’ self-reported likelihood of donating largely through general affective evaluations of the request, their likelihood of experiencing self-conscious moral emotions, and to a lesser extent, the perceived need of the requestor. © 2017 Eastern Communication Association.","Bolkan, S.",Commun.

Responsibility: The tie that binds,"People share significantly more money with others in common lab paradigms like the dictator game than they do in real life. What accounts for this difference? Paradigms like the dictator game link each recipient to a single dictator with the implication that each recipient can receive funds from only one person. We argue that this ""burden"" of responsibility to a single recipient helps to explain high levels of laboratory sharing. In two experiments-a modified dictator game experiment and a charitable giving experiment-participants donated significantly more to others when they were solely responsible for a recipient's outcome than when the responsibility for a recipient was potentially shared. Taken together with past findings from social psychology and experimental economics, the results show how unambiguous responsibility for a single recipient increases generosity. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.","Cryder, C.E.; Loewenstein, G.",J.

"Free will, science and causes of behavior","Some scientists and philosophers, based on scientific discoveries and empirical evidence, argue that free will does not exist. Some authors defend the opposite opinion. The universality of their reasoning unites opponents. They seek to correlate scientific knowledge with the entire sum of human actions and, consequently justify the existence of freedom of will or its absence. In the paper, I propose to narrow the focus of the issue to the study of the degree of freedom of individual actions or certain classes of actions. For this, I introduce the epistemic criterion, according to it, recognition of the action as not free requires knowledge of the causes of the action for which the agent is not responsible. I analyse two groups of cases: those where scientific knowledge reveals hidden causes of behavior and those where the causes remain unknown. Actions from the second group still constitute an essential part of our behavior. The amount of knowledge about the causes of actions will increase over time, but this knowledge will never be comprehensive. © 2018 RAS Institute of Philosophy.

"The quantity and quality of complementary and alternative medicine clinical practice guidelines on herbal medicines, acupuncture and spinal manipulation: systematic review and assessment using AGREE II","BACKGROUND: Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use is often not disclosed by patients, and can be unfamiliar to health care professionals. This may lead to underuse of beneficial CAM therapies, and overuse of other CAM therapies with little proven benefit or known contraindications. No prior research has thoroughly evaluated the credibility of knowledge-based resources. The purpose of this research was to assess the quantity and quality of CAM guidelines. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted to identify CAM guidelines. MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL were searched in January 2016 from 2003 to 2015. The National Guideline Clearinghouse, National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health web site, and two CAM journals were also searched. Eligible guidelines published in English language by non-profit agencies on herbal medicine, acupuncture, or spinal manipulation for adults with any condition were assessed with the Appraisal of Guidelines, Research and Evaluation II (AGREE II) instrument. RESULTS: From 3,126 unique search results, 17 guidelines (two herbal medicine, three acupuncture, four spinal manipulation, eight mixed CAM therapies) published in 2003 or later and relevant to several clinical conditions were eligible. Scaled domain percentages from highest to lowest were clarity of presentation (85.3 %), scope and purpose (83.3 %), rigour of development (61.2 %), editorial independence (60.1 %), stakeholder involvement (52.0 %) and applicability (20.7 %). Quality varied within and across guidelines. None of the 17 guidelines were recommended by both appraisers; 14 were recommended as Yes or Yes with modifications. CONCLUSIONS: Guidelines that scored well could be used by patients and health care professionals as the basis for discussion about the use of these CAM therapies. In future updates, guidelines that achieved variable or lower scores could be improved according to specifications in the AGREE II instrument, and with insight from a large number of resources that are available to support guideline development and implementation. Future research should identify CAM therapies other than those reviewed here for which guidelines are available. Research is also needed on the safety and effectiveness of CAM therapies.","Ng, Jeremy Y; Liang, Laurel; Gagliardi, Anna R",BMC Complement. Altern. Med.,472
Economic status and acknowledgement of earned entitlement,"We present a series of experiments that investigates whether tendencies to acknowledge entitlement owing to effort and productivity are associated with within-society economic status. Each participant played a four-person dictator game under one of two treatments, under one initial endowments were earned, under the other they were randomly assigned. The experiments were conducted in the United Kingdom, and South Africa. In both locations we found that relatively well-off individuals make allocations to others that reflect those others' initial endowments more when those endowments were earned rather than random; among relatively poor individuals this was not the case. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Barr, A.; Burns, J.; Miller, L.; Shaw, I.",J.

Measuring exposure to health messages in community-based intervention studies: a systematic review of current practices,"Accurately measuring exposure is critical to all intervention studies. The present review examines the extent to which best practices in exposure assessment are adhered to in community-based prevention and education studies. A systematic literature review was conducted examining community-based studies testing communication interventions, published in 2003-2007. Of 663 studies identified, 54 met all inclusion criteria and were reviewed for type of exposure assessment conducted (if any), use of exposure data in study analyses, and discussion of biases related to exposure assessment. Although a majority of studies (n = 38; 70%) assessed exposure, most of these used only a simple dichotomous measure (n = 31; 82%), less than half used exposure data to adjust intervention effects (n = 16; 42%), and only six (16%) addressed selective exposure as a possible source of bias. There is substantial room for improvement in measurement and analysis of exposure to communication in community-based disease prevention studies.","Morris, Daniel S; Rooney, Megan P; Wray, Ricardo J; Kreuter, Matthew W",Health Educ.

Theory of mind and prosocial behavior in childhood: A meta-analytic review,"It has been argued that children who possess an advanced theory of mind (ToM) are more likely to act prosocially, yet the empirical findings are mixed. To address this issue definitively, a meta-analytic integration of all prior literature that met appropriate inclusion criteria was conducted. In total, 76 studies including 6,432 children between 2 and 12 years of age contributed to these analyses. Collapsed across all studies, a significant association emerged (r = .19), indicating that children with higher ToM scores also received higher scores on concurrent measures of prosocial behavior. The magnitude of this effect was similar across ToM assessments requiring identification of others' cognitions versus emotions, and it existed irrespective of whether the ToM measure imposed demands on false belief reasoning or not. The association with ToM was also evident for different subtypes of prosocial behavior (helping, cooperating, comforting). ToM had a similar effect for boys and girls, but was slightly stronger in children aged 6 years or older, relative to their younger peers. Taken together, these findings provide the strongest evidence to date that being able to explicitly consider what other people are thinking and feeling is related to children's tendencies to act prosocially, although the magnitude of the association is relatively weak.

Non-pharmacological strategies for blood conservation in cardiac surgery,"PURPOSE: Of all surgical specialties, cardiac operations are most often associated with coagulopathy, blood loss, and the need for transfusions. This not only represents a major burden on blood procurement and banking organizations at all levels, but also constitutes a risk for each patient receiving allogeneic blood products. This paper reviews current non-pharmacological strategies aimed at decreasing blood use in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. SOURCE: The literature pertaining to each blood conservation strategy was searched, reviewed, and appraised. Meta- analyses were also consulted and their results complemented with subsequent reports when available. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Preoperative autologous donation programs are effective in decreasing allogeneic transfusions, but are costly and applicable to elective patients only. Off-pump revascularization strategies also appear to decrease transfusion requirements in suitable patients. The effectiveness of acute normovolemic hemodilution, retrograde autologous priming, small volume cardiopulmonary bypass circuits, platelet-rich plasmapheresis, alternative heparin strategies, and postoperative cell salvage are more difficult to appraise as a high proportion of available studies suffer from lack of transfusion guidelines or the absence of blinding. Biological glues, surgical adhesives, and postoperative increases in positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) have no demonstrated efficacy. CONCLUSION: The applicability or effectiveness of many of these modalities remains controversial and more studies are needed before they may be employed routinely in cardiac surgical patients. The judicious use of rational transfusion guidelines may still be the simplest and most cost-effective means of blood conservation today.","Ruel, M A; Rubens, F D",Can. J. Anaesth.,476

Humans best judge how much to cooperate when facing hard problems in large groups,"We report the results of a game-theoretic experiment with human players who solve problems of increasing complexity by cooperating in groups of increasing size. Our experimental environment is set up to make it complicated for players to use rational calculation for making the cooperative decisions. This environment is directly translated into a computer simulation, from which we extract the collaboration strategy that leads to the maximal attainable score. Based on this, we measure the error that players make when estimating the benefits of collaboration, and find that humans massively underestimate these benefits when facing easy problems or working alone or in small groups. In contrast, when confronting hard problems or collaborating in large groups, humans accurately judge the best level of collaboration and easily achieve the maximal score. Our findings are independent on groups’ composition and players’ personal traits. We interpret them as varying degrees of usefulness of social heuristics, which seems to depend on the size of the involved group and the complexity of the situation. © 2019, The Author(s).","Guazzini, A.; Stefanelli, F.; Imbimbo, E.; Vilone, D.; Bagnoli, F.; Levnajić, Z.",Sci.

Fixed- and Random-Effects Models in Meta-Analysis,There are 2 families of statistical procedures in meta-analysis: fixed- and random-effects procedures. They were developed for somewhat different inference goals: making inferences about the effect parameters in the studies that have been observed versus making inferences about the distribution of effect parameters in a population of studies from a random sample of studies. The authors evaluate the performance of confidence intervals and hypothesis tests when each type of statistical procedure is used for each type of inference and confirm that each procedure is best for making the kind of inference for which it was designed. Conditionally random-effects procedures (a hybrid type) are shown to have properties in between those of fixed- and random-effects procedures.,"Hedges, L.V.; Vevea, J.L.",Psychol. Methods,479
Anticipated guilt for not helping and anticipated warm glow for helping are differently impacted by personal responsibility to help,"One important motivation for people behaving prosocially is that they want to avoid negative and obtain positive emotions. In the prosocial behavior literature however, the motivations to avoid negative emotions (e.g., guilt) and to approach positive emotions (e.g., warm glow) are rarely separated, and sometimes even aggregated into a single mood-management construct. The aim of this study was to investigate whether anticipated guilt if not helping and anticipated warm glow if helping are influenced similarly or differently when varying situational factors related to personal responsibility to help. Helping scenarios were created and pilot tests established that each helping scenario could be formulated both in a high-responsibility version and in a low-responsibility version. In Study 1 participants read high-responsibility and low-responsibility helping scenarios, and rated either their anticipated guilt if not helping or their anticipated warm glow if helping (i.e., separate evaluation). Study 2 was similar but here participants rated both their anticipated guilt if not helping and their anticipated warm glow if helping (i.e., joint evaluation). Anticipated guilt was clearly higher in the high-responsibility versions, but anticipated warm glow was unaffected (in Studies 1a and 1b), or even higher in the low-responsibility versions (Study 2). In Studies 3 (where anticipated guilt and warm glow were evaluated separately) and 4 (where they were evaluated jointly), personal responsibility to help was manipulated within-subjects. Anticipated guilt was again constantly higher in the high-responsibility versions but for many types of responsibility-manipulations, anticipated warm glow was higher in the low-responsibility versions. The results suggest that we anticipate guilt if not fulfilling our responsibility but that we anticipate warm glow primarily when doing over and beyond our responsibility. We argue that future studies investigating motivations for helping should measure both anticipated negative consequences for oneself if not helping, and anticipated positive consequences for oneself if helping. © 2016 Erlandsson, Jungstrand and Västfjäll.","Erlandsson, A.; Jungstrand, A.; Västfjäll, D.",Front.

The viability of transplanting organs from donors who underwent cardiopulmonary resuscitation: A systematic review,"AIMS: To identify reports of patients who underwent cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) prior to solid organ donation and compare recipient and organ function outcomes to those that did not undergo CPR. Donation after restoration of circulation then progressing to death and those donating with on-going CPR who would have otherwise have termination of efforts were both included. METHODS: Systematic review. Clinical studies comparing the outcome of patients and organs retrieved from donors who underwent CPR with those that did not require CPR. Full-text articles were searched on EmBASE, MEDLINE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials. RESULTS: Twenty-two observational studies were included. There were 12,206 adult and 2552 paediatric organ transplantation identified. Comparing donation after restoration of circulation there was no difference in immediate, one year, and five-year graft function. Donation with on-going CPR was associated with reduced immediate graft function for both renal and hepatic transplantation, however long term function was not different. CONCLUSIONS: CPR does not appear to adversely affect graft function. Patients who have restored circulation after resuscitation and subsequently progress to death should be evaluated for organ donation. Those with on-going CPR should be considered for hepatic and renal transplantation but there may be worse initial graft function.","West, Stephen; Soar, Jasmeet; Callaway, Clifton W",Resuscitation,481

On the influence of emotion on decision making: The case of charitable giving,"This chapter summarizes and discusses methodologies and findings of recent research focused on the influence of emotion on decision-making in general and charitable giving in particular. Exploring how appraisal theory findings carry over to the decision of charitable giving, we experimentally examine the influence of incidental sadness and anger on charitable donations to an identified or a statistical victim. First, subjects viewed a previously validated film clip and provided a written response to how they would feel in the situation in the clip. Subjects then viewed a charity letter and had the opportunity to make a donation. Overall, participants in both the sad and angry conditions donated more than participants in the control condition. Sad individuals donated more money to a statistical victim relative to individuals in a neutral condition. This finding is consistent with appraisal-tendency theories. Angry individuals, however, did not donate significantly more to either an identified or statistical victim relative to individuals in a neutral condition. Self-reported emotions reveal discrete levels of sadness elicited in the sad condition, but elevated levels of additional negative emotions in the anger conditions. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Kandrack, R.; Lundberg, G.",Stud.

To mitigate or not to mitigate: The price elasticity of pro-environmental behavior,"This paper investigates the relationship between the price of pro-environmental behavior (PEB) and individuals’ voluntary choice to engage in PEB. Its approach combines two literatures: An experimental one that varies the price of consequential contribution decisions indirectly, and the stated preferences literature that elicits responses from subjects to direct, but hypothetical price variations. We apply this approach to the price elasticity of participating in climate change mitigation. In an online field experiment, we observe the decision of a representative sample of 2,440 subjects whether to reduce the emissions of CO2 into the atmosphere by one metric ton or receive a monetary reward between €2 and €100. In contrast to previous findings from indirect price variation, but in line with stated preference approaches, voluntary PEB is found to have non-zero elasticity of probability (about −0.3 across the treatment range). The inelastic response of the probability of PEB to direct price variation is robust with respect to a range of controls and with respect to the potential problem of field price censoring. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Diederich, J.; Goeschl, T.",J.

Do Government Expenditures Shift Private Philanthropic Donations to Particular Fields of Welfare? Evidence from Cross-country Data,"Do government expenditures shift private philanthropic donations to particular fields of welfare? We examine this association in the first cross-country study to correlate government expenditures with the level of individual private donations to different fields of welfare using the Individual International Philanthropy Database (IIPD, 2016; N country = 19; N individual = 126,923). The results of the descriptive and multilevel analyses support the idea of crosswise crowding-in; in countries where government expenditures in health and social protection are higher, more donors give to support the environment, international aid, and the arts. The level of giving to different sectors, however, is not associated with government expenditures. The results reject the crowding-out hypothesis and provide a nuanced picture of the relationship between government funding and philanthropic giving across different fields of social welfare. © The Author(s) 2018.

Personality and Prosocial Behavior: A Multilevel Meta-Analysis,"We investigate the effect of personality on prosocial behavior in a Bayesian multilevel meta-analysis (MLMA) of 15 published, interdisciplinary experimental studies. With data from the 15 studies constituting nearly 2500 individual observations, we find that the Big Five traits of Agreeableness and Openness are significantly and positively associated with prosocial behavior, while none of the other three traits are. These results are robust to a number of different model specifications and operationalizations of prosociality, and they greatly clarify the contradictory findings in the literature on the relationship between personality and prosocial behavior. Though previous research has indicated that incentivized experiments result in reduced prosocial behavior, we find no evidence that monetary incentivization of participants affects prosocial tendencies. By leveraging individual observations from multiple studies and explicitly modeling the multilevel structure of the data, MLMA permits the simultaneous estimation of study- and individual-level effects. The Bayesian approach allows us to estimate study-level effects in an unbiased and efficient manner, even with a relatively small number of studies. We conclude by discussing the limitations of our study and the advantages and disadvantages of the MLMA method.","Kline, Reuben; Bankert, Alexa; Levitan, Lindsey; Kraft, Patrick",Political Science Research and Methods,488
Reputation is valuable within and outside one's own social group,"To find conditions under which humans cooperate within groups of unrelated individuals has been of major interest in the behavioral sciences. The experimental paradigm for studying potential cooperation in social dilemmas is the public goods game. Here humans regularly fail to sustain a public resource cooperatively. However, the need to maintain good reputation for other social interactions, such as indirect reciprocity, has been identified as an effective mechanism to sustain cooperation in public goods situations. As a side effect of building a good reputation through cooperative actions, an individual provides direct benefits to members of his/her own social group. These benefits could be an incentive to reward a good reputation of group members. Here we show experimentally that building a good reputation through cooperative behavior in a public goods situation is rewarded in future social interactions, not only within one's own social group but also, at a similar level, in other social groups: humans regard cooperative behavior of others as an honest signal irrespective of past direct personal benefits. Reputation gained within as well as outside one's own social group can be a driving force for selfish individuals to cooperate in public goods situations, and thereby sustain any public resource. © Springer-Verlag 2005.","Semmann, D.; Krambeck, H.-J.; Milinski, M.",Behav.

Kinesio taping in treatment and prevention of sports injuries: a meta-analysis of the evidence for its effectiveness,"Kinesio tape (KT) is an elastic therapeutic tape used for treating sports injuries and a variety of other disorders. Chiropractor, Dr Kenso Kase, developed KT taping techniques in the 1970s. It is claimed that KT supports injured muscles and joints and helps relieve pain by lifting the skin and allowing improved blood and lymph flow. The profile of KT rose after the tape was donated to 58 countries for use during the 2008 Olympic Games, and was seen on high-profile athletes. Practitioners are asking whether they should use KT over other elastic adhesive tapes. The aim of this review was to evaluate, using meta-analysis, the effectiveness of KT in the treatment and prevention of sports injuries. Electronic databases including SPORTDiscus, Scopus, MEDLINE, ScienceDirect and sports medicine websites were searched using keywords 'kinesio taping/tape'. From 97 articles, ten met the inclusion criteria (article reported data for effect of KT on a musculoskeletal outcome and had a control group) and were retained for meta-analyses. Magnitude-based inferences were used to assess clinical worth of positive outcomes reported in studies. Only two studies investigated sports-related injuries (shoulder impingement), and just one of these involved injured athletes. Studies attending to musculoskeletal outcomes in healthy participants were included on the basis that these outcomes may have implications for the prevention of sporting injuries. The efficacy of KT in pain relief was trivial given there were no clinically important results. There were inconsistent range-of-motion outcome results, with at least small beneficial results seen in two studies, but trivial results in two other studies across numerous joint measurements. There was a likely beneficial effect for proprioception regarding grip force sense error, but no positive outcome for ankle proprioception. Seven outcomes relating to strength were beneficial, although there were numerous trivial findings for quadriceps and hamstrings peak torque, and grip strength measures. KT had some substantial effects on muscle activity, but it was unclear whether these changes were beneficial or harmful. In conclusion, there was little quality evidence to support the use of KT over other types of elastic taping in the management or prevention of sports injuries. KT may have a small beneficial role in improving strength, range of motion in certain injured cohorts and force sense error compared with other tapes, but further studies are needed to confirm these findings. The amount of case study and anecdotal support for KT warrants well designed experimental research, particularly pertaining to sporting injuries, so that practitioners can be confident that KT is beneficial for their athletes.","Williams, Sean; Whatman, Chris; Hume, Patria A; Sheerin, Kelly",Sports Med.,490

Modeling charitable contributions of time and money,"Public goods theory predicts that government spending on charity can perfectly crowd-out charitable contributions. Empirical research has found little support for the perfect crowd-out hypothesis. However, the empirical work only measures part of a contributor's total contribution: gifts of money. Contributors also volunteer labor. This article extends the public goods model to the case in which individuals contribute both time and money to a charity that in turn produces a public good. The model suggests that charitable contributions of time and money are perfectly substitutable in equilibrium. This result offers new interpretations for existing empirical observations, and suggests a new test of the crowd-out hypothesis. The implications of the model are empirically tested using a national survey of charitable activity.","Duncan, B.",J. Public Econ.,494
Fairness in risky environments: Theory and evidence,"The relationship between risk in the environment, risk aversion and inequality aversion is not well understood. Theories of fairness have typically assumed that pie sizes are known ex-ante. Pie sizes are, however, rarely known ex ante. Using two simple allocation problems-the Dictator and Ultimatum game-we explore whether, and how exactly, unknown pie sizes with varying degrees of risk (""endowment risk"") influence individual behavior. We derive theoretical predictions for these games using utility functions that capture additively separable constant relative risk aversion and inequity aversion. We experimentally test the theoretical predictions using two subject pools: students of Czech Technical University and employees of Prague City Hall. We find that: (1) Those who are more risk-averse are also more inequality-averse in the Dictator game (and also in the Ultimatum game but there not statistically significantly so) in that they give more; (2) Using the within-subject feature of our design, and in line with our theoretical prediction, varying risk does not influence behavior in the Dictator game, but does so in the Ultimatum game (contradicting our theoretical prediction for that game); (3) Using the within-subject feature of our design, subjects tend to make inconsistent decisions across games; this is true on the level of individuals as well as in the aggregate. This latter finding contradicts the evidence in Blanco et al. (2011); (4) There are no subject-pool differences once we control for the elicited risk attitude and demographic variables that we collect. © 2013 by the author; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Van Koten, S.; Ortmann, A.; Babicky, V.",Games,495
Attentional mechanisms in the generation of sympathy,"Empathic responses, such as sympathy towards others, are a key ingredient in the decision to provide help to those in need. The determinants of empathic responses are usually thought to be the vividness, similarity, and proximity of the victim. However, recent research highlights the role that attention plays in the generation of feelings. We expanded on this idea by investigating whether sympathy depends on cognitive mechanisms such as attention. In two studies we found that sympathy responses were lower and reaction times were longer when targets were presented with distractors. In addition, online sympathy judgments that allow attentional focusing on a target lead to greater affective responses than judgments made from memory. We conclude that attention is an ingredient in the generation of sympathy, and discuss implications for research on prosocial behaviour and the interaction between attention and emotions.","Dickert, S.; Slovic, P.",Judgm.

Do government appropriations and tax policies impact donations to public research universities in Japan and the USA?,"As constraints on government funding to public universities become a trend in higher education internationally, clarifying the impact of government policies on donor behavior from a comparative perspective is an issue of higher education research. This paper aims to explore the impact of government appropriations and tax policies on macro trends in donations to public research universities in Japan and USA. Panel data of donation revenue to public research universities in both countries is used to answer the following two research questions: (1) whether the trends in capital markets affect the donation revenue of public research universities operating under different tax systems in Japan and USA, and (2) how the level of government support to higher education affects donations to American and Japanese public research universities. The primary finding is that stock prices are positively associated with donations in USA; however, there is no evidence that stock prices have a positive impact on donations to Japanese public research universities. These contrasting results imply that higher stock prices do not always induce donations to universities and that it is important to consider each country’s tax structure when looking for possible links between stock prices and donations to universities. Also, donor behavior is independent of the amount of government appropriations received by universities in both Japan and USA; therefore, the recent decreasing trends in government appropriations in both countries do not necessarily attract donors. © 2020, The Author(s).","Fukui, F.",High.

A meta-analysis of the pique technique of compliance,"A random-effects meta-analysis was undertaken to examine the effectiveness of the pique technique of compliance-gaining. Results indicated an overall significant effect of the pique technique on increased compliance rate across 17 comparisons (r =.27). Moderator analyses showed the technique worked significantly better than controls in gaining compliance when a smaller amount was requested, when the reason for the request was included, and when the technique was used in France. In addition, the pique technique was more successful than control requests in terms of the total amount of money or time given by participants and the percentage of participants inquiring about the requests. Theoretical and practical implications for the success of pique technique are discussed for future research. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Lee, S.; Feeley, T.H.",Soc.

Averaging Correlation Coefficients: Should Fisher's z Transformation Be Used?,"Averaging correlations leads to underestimation because the sampling distribution of the correlation coefficient is skewed. It is also known that if correlations are transformed by Fisher's z prior to averaging, the resulting average overestimates the population value of z. The behavior of these procedures for averaging correlations was investigated via Monte Carlo simulation, both in terms of bias (under- and overestimation) and precision (standard errors). It was found that average z backtransformed to r is less biased positively than average r is biased negatively. The standard error of average r was smaller than that of average z when the population correlation was small; however, the reverse was true when the population correlation exceeded 5. Regardless of sample size, backtransformed average z was always less biased; therefore, the use of the z transformation is recommended when averaging correlation coefficients, particularly when sample size is small. © 1987 American Psychological Association.","Silver, N.C.; Dunlap, W.P.",J.

Increasing altruistic and cooperative behaviour with simple moral nudges,"The conflict between pro-self and pro-social behaviour is at the core of many key problems of our time, as, for example, the reduction of air pollution and the redistribution of scarce resources. For the well-being of our societies, it is thus crucial to find mechanisms to promote pro-social choices over egoistic ones. Particularly important, because cheap and easy to implement, are those mechanisms that can change people’s behaviour without forbidding any options or significantly changing their economic incentives, the so-called “nudges”. Previous research has found that moral nudges (e.g., making norms salient) can promote pro-social behaviour. However, little is known about whether their effect persists over time and spills across context. This question is key in light of research showing that pro-social actions are often followed by selfish actions, thus suggesting that some moral manipulations may backfire. Here we present a class of simple moral nudges that have a great positive impact on pro-sociality. In Studies 1–4 (total N = 1,400), we use economic games to demonstrate that asking subjects to self-report “what they think is the morally right thing to do” does not only increase pro-sociality in the choice immediately after, but also in subsequent choices, and even when the social context changes. In Study 5, we explore whether moral nudges promote charity donations to humanitarian organisations in a large (N = 1,800) crowdfunding campaign. We find that, in this context, moral nudges increase donations by about 44 percent. © 2019, The Author(s).","Capraro, V.; Jagfeld, G.; Klein, R.; Mul, M.; de Pol, I.",Sci. Rep.,502
Cord blood transplantation,"Cord blood transplantation (CBT) is an alternative to bone marrow transplantation (BMT) that has been used to reconstitute hematopoiesis in various hematological disorders. Most patients treated with CBT have been children. CBT has potential advantages over BMT because of the lower incidence and milder form of graft versus host disease. As a greater degree of HLA mismatch is possible, as compared to BMT, CBT is a potential treatment for many patients whose other management options are limited. Disadvantages of CBT compared with BMT are the slower rates of engraftment, the limit to the absolute cell dose and, possibly, the absolute number of stem cells available for a single transplant. Evidence of the efficacy and safety of CBT is still limited. Published reports have been based upon uncontrolled studies, usually with small numbers of subjects. There are not yet adequate comparative studies on the efficacy and safety of CBT compared to other therapies for specific hematological diseases. If CBT is to become a widely available technology, there will be a need for prompt availability of suitable donors and for large cord blood banks. Costs of cord blood banks and their level of use will require careful consideration. A number of ethical and legal issues, related, for example, to detection of disease, consent for donation and anonymity of the donor, require further discussion. In the context of the Alberta health care system, CBT should be regarded as a promising, evolving technology for treatment of some types of pediatric patients","M, Yunkap Kwankam; Hailey, D; Jacobs, P",,503
Intuition and moral decision-making-the effect of time pressure and cognitive load on moral judgment and altruistic behavior,"Do individuals intuitively favor certain moral actions over others? This study explores the role of intuitive thinking-induced by time pressure and cognitive load-in moral judgment and behavior. We conduct experiments in three different countries (Sweden, Austria, and the United States) involving over 1,400 subjects. All subjects responded to four trolley type dilemmas and four dictator games involving different charitable causes. Decisions were made under time pressure/time delay or while experiencing cognitive load or control. Overall we find converging evidence that intuitive states do not influence moral decisions. Neither time-pressure nor cognitive load had any effect on moral judgments or altruistic behavior. Thus we find no supporting evidence for the claim that intuitive moral judgments and dictator game giving differ from more reflectively taken decisions. Across all samples and decision tasks men were more likely to make utilitarian moral judgments and act selfishly compared to women, providing further evidence that there are robust gender differences in moral decision-making. However, there were no significant interactions between gender and the treatment manipulations of intuitive versus reflective decision-making. © 2016 Tinghög et al.

(Not) alone in the world: Cheating in the presence of a virtual observer,"We conducted an experiment in a high-immersive virtual reality environment to study the effect of the presence of a virtual observer on cheating behavior. Participants were placed in a virtual room and played 30 rounds of a cheating game without a chance of their cheating being detected. We varied whether or not a virtual observer (an avatar) was present in the room, and, if so, whether the avatar was actively staring at the decision maker or passively seated in a corner watching his smartphone. Results display significantly less cheating with an active than with a passive avatar, but not less cheating than in a control condition without an avatar. This suggests that an active (virtual) observer can intensify reputational concerns, but that the presence of someone passive and uninterested may actually alleviate such concerns. © 2020, The Author(s).","Mol, J.M.; van der Heijden, E.C.M.; Potters, J.J.M.",Exp.

WE HAVEN'T TALKED IN 30 YEARS!: Relationship reconnection and internet use at midlife,"The phenomenon of reconnection of dormant ties using internet communication technologies has been identified as having salience in the use of social media forms by midlife and older adults. Dormant ties, as distinguished from those that are merely inactive, are those that were once operational, but which have lapsed under the stressors of time, distance and circumstance, such as relationships between former college friends, neighbors or work colleagues. Reconnection is the process by which these dormant ties become active again, and is an activity which is supported in unique ways by internet communication technologies. This study presents findings from interviews with midlife adults on how the use of email, social network sites and search engines is leveraged to enhance and support the reconnection of dormant relationships and maintain weak ties. Grounded in a life course perspective, it examines how the experiences of longevity and the life course alter perceptions of the attributes and drawbacks that these technologies offer. By examining adults at midlife, a less-well studied group than teens and young adults, this work provides a more nuanced perspective of the technological practices at varied points in life, and offers insight on how various communication technologies might be utilized at different life stages. © 2013 Copyright Kelly Quinn.","Quinn, K.",Inf.

What Motivates Effort? Evidence and Expert Forecasts,"How much do different monetary and non-monetary motivators induce costly effort? Does the effectiveness line up with the expectations of researchers and with results in the literature? We conduct a large-scale real-effort experiment with eighteen treatment arms. We examine the effect of (1) standard incentives; (2) behavioural factors like social preferences and reference dependence; and (3) non-monetary inducements from psychology. We find that (1) monetary incentives work largely as expected, including a very low piece rate treatment which does not crowd out effort; (2) the evidence is partly consistent with standard behavioural models, including warm glow, though we do not find evidence of probability weighting; (3) the psychological motivators are effective, but less so than incentives.We then compare the results to forecasts by 208 academic experts. On average, the experts anticipate several key features, like the effectiveness of psychological motivators. A sizeable share of experts, however, expects crowd-out, probability weighting, and pure altruism, counterfactually. As a further comparison, we present a metaanalysis of similar treatments in the literature. Overall, predictions based on the literature are correlated with, but underperform, the expert forecasts. © The Author 2017.

However, the laws of social influence may not be as easily dodged. In the virtual world of There.com we tested two robust real-world compliance tactics (foot-in-the-door, door-in-the-face) with avatar ""race"" as a moderator. Results revealed success for both techniques, suggesting that avatars are sensitive to influence tactics targeting both self-perception and reciprocity norms. Additionally, the race of the avatar requesting help impacted the success of the door-in-the-face compliance technique, raising the specter that real-world racial biases may also emerge in virtual environments.","Eastwick, P.W.; Gardner, W.L.",Soc.

Towards an International Political Ergonomics,"This article introduces International Political Ergonomics. International Political Ergonomics is a novel research programme focused on achieving political change through the ergonomic (re)design of world politics. The approach is grounded on a shift across International Relations which recognizes that its epistemic (i.e. knowledge-producing) core is often inadequate to achieve change. Insights from the practice turn and behaviouralist International Relations, as well as from philosophy, sociology and neuroscience, demonstrate that much international behaviour is driven by the ‘unconscious’ or ‘non-reflexive’ re-articulation of repertoires of actions even where the pathologies of this process are known. This implies that knowledge production and dissemination (i.e. to policymakers, global publics) is often unable to effect influence over social practices. What is thus required is a non-epistemic means of producing world political change. International Political Ergonomics is a research programme that takes up this task. It does so by describing how small material interventions into world politics can radically shift individual behaviours by encouraging greater rationality, reflexivity and deliberation. After laying out the theoretical basis for this claim, the article demonstrates it by detailing the application of International Political Ergonomics to violence-prevention efforts. The article concludes by reflecting on the radical implications that International Political Ergonomics has for the vocation of International Relations. © The Author(s) 2019.","Austin, J.L.",Eur. J.

(The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2013-30843-003[/rid].) Objectives: Titmuss hypothesized that paying blood donors would reduce the quality of the blood donated and would be economically inefficient. We report here the first systematic review to test these hypotheses, reporting on both financial and nonfinancial incentives. Method: Studies deemed eligible for inclusion were peer-reviewed, experimental studies that presented data on the quantity (as a proxy for efficiency) and quality of blood donated in at least two groups: those donating blood when offered an incentive, and those donating blood with no offer of an incentive. The following were searched: MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycINFO using OVID SP, CINAHL via EBSCO and CENTRAL, the Cochrane Library, Econlit via EBSCO, JSTOR Health and General Science Collection, and Google. Results: The initial search yielded 1100 abstracts, which resulted in 89 full papers being assessed for eligibility, of which seven studies, reported in six papers, met the inclusion criteria. The included studies involved 93,328 participants. Incentives had no impact on the likelihood of donation (OR = 1.22 CI 95% 0.91–1.63; p = .19). There was no difference between financial and nonfinancial incentives in the quantity of blood donated. Of the two studies that assessed quality of blood, one found no effect and the other found an adverse effect from the offer of a free cholesterol test (β = 0.011 p < .05). Conclusion: The limited evidence suggests that Titmuss’ hypothesis of the economic inefficiency of incentives is correct. There is insufficient evidence to assess their likely impact on the quality of the blood provided.

Participation-performance tension and gender affect recreational sports clubs’ engagement with children and young people with diverse backgrounds and abilities,"Sport participation has been shown to be associated with health and social benefits. However, there are persisting inequities and barriers to sport participation that can prevent children and young people with diverse backgrounds and abilities from accessing these benefits. This mixed methods study investigated how diversity is understood, experienced and managed in junior sport. The study combined in-depth interviews (n = 101), surveys (n = 450) and observations over a three-year period. The results revealed that a focus on performance and competitiveness negatively affected junior sports clubs’ commitment to diversity and inclusive participation. Gender and a range of attitudes about diversity were also strongly related. On average, we found that those who identified as men were more likely to support a pro-performance stance, be homophobic, endorse stricter gender roles, and endorse violence as a natural masculine trait. In addition, those who identified as men were less likely to hold pro-disability attitudes. These findings suggest that the participation-performance tension and gender affect to what extent, and how, sports clubs engage children and young people with diverse backgrounds and abilities. © 2019 Spaaij et al.

Psychological Sex Differences: Origins Through Sexual Selection,"Men and women clearly differ in some psychological domains. A. H. Eagly (1995) shows that these differences are not artifactual or unstable. Ideally, the next scientific step is to develop a cogent explanatory framework for understanding why the sexes differ in some psychological domains and not in others and for generating accurate predictions about sex differences as yet undiscovered. This article offers a brief outline of an explanatory framework for psychological sex differences-one that is anchored in the new theoretical paradigm of evolutionary psychology. Men and women differ, in this view, in domains in which they have faced different adaptive problems over human evolutionary history. In all other domains, the sexes are predicted to be psychologically similar. Evolutionary psychology jettisons the false dichotomy between biology and environment and provides a powerful metatheory of why sex differences exist, where they exist, and in what contexts they are expressed (D. M. Buss, 1995). © 1995 American Psychological Association.","Buss, D.M.",Am. Psychol.,518

Financial performance of the United Kingdom's national non-profit sport federations: a binary logistic regression approach,"Purpose: The aim of this study was to predict the financial performance of the United Kingdom's (UK) national non-profit sport federations (NNSFs) using financial effectiveness indicators and financial efficiency ratios, as framed by the resource dependency theory and stakeholder theory. Design/methodology/approach: The dependent variable was financial performance quantified as net income. The independent variables were financial effectiveness (measured as total assets and revenues) and financial efficiency (indicated as return on assets, sponsorship efficiency and donation efficiency). With the help of panel data, the study utilised binary logistic regression and Kendall’ tau correlations. Findings: Binary regression results reported a Nagelkerke R2 of 87.5%, with ROA and donation efficiency being the best predictors of financial performance. Results from Kendall’ tau correlations indicated a positive and statistical association between financial performance and financial effectiveness and financial efficiency. Research limitations/implications: The study was delimited to UK non-profit sports organisations that had free, useable and publicly available financial data. For top management, donors and policy advocates, the study highlighted the superiority of financial efficiency over financial effectiveness. Originality/value: The study adds to research, theory and practitioners' perspectives by offering a new way of evaluating financial performance with the combination of financial effectiveness and efficiency and not opinions, a factor uncommon in previous studies. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Omondi-Ochieng, P.",Manag.

Evidence for the impact of quality improvement collaboratives: systematic review,"The effects of quality improvement collaboratives were uncertain and may at best have only a moderate effect on outcomes. XCM: The review objectives and inclusion criteria were clear. Relevant sources were searched. The restriction to English-language studies may have meant that some studies were missed. It appeared that no specific attempts were made to locate unpublished studies. Two reviewers assessed study selection. Steps were taken to minimise reviewer error in data extraction and quality assessment. Relevant criteria were used to assess study quality. The decision not to report findings of the uncontrolled studies in detail appeared justified. The authors highlighted statistically significant findings in the higher quality studies, although no measures of variance were reported. Heterogeneity between studies was well addressed in the text. The authors noted that their definition of quality improvement collaboration may have introduced bias if included studies differed systematically from similar interventions that involved other features and they discussed other potential sources of bias. Despite some limitations in the search, the review was generally well-conducted and the cautious conclusions are likely to be reliable. XIM: Practice: The authors did not state any implications for practice.Research: The authors stated that more evidence was needed on which components of quality improvement collaboratives were effective and cost-effective, and the effect of contextual factors and site characteristics on outcomes.","Schouten, L M; Hulscher, M E; van Everdingen, J J; Huijsman, R; Grol, R P",,522
Nameless + harmless = blameless: When seemingly irrelevant factors influence judgment of (un)ethical behavior,"People often make judgments about the ethicality of others' behaviors and then decide how harshly to punish such behaviors. When they make these judgments and decisions, sometimes the victims of the unethical behavior are identifiable, and sometimes they are not. In addition, in our uncertain world, sometimes an unethical action causes harm, and sometimes it does not. We argue that a rational assessment of ethicality should not depend on the identifiability of the victim of wrongdoing or the actual harm caused if the judge and the decision maker have the same information. Yet in five laboratory studies, we show that these factors have a systematic effect on how people judge the ethicality of the perpetrator of an unethical action. Our studies show that people judge behavior as more unethical when: (1) identifiable vs. unidentifiable victims are involved and (2) the behavior leads to a negative rather than a positive outcome. We also find that people's willingness to punish wrongdoers is consistent with their judgments, and we offer preliminary evidence on how to reduce these biases. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Differential perception of source legitimacy in sequential request strategies,"Foot-in-the-door (FITD) and door-in-the face (DITF) techniques were compared in a telephone survey that also sought to assess how legitimate the source of the request seemed to the respondents. Calls were made to 120 Americans by an interviewer from a fictitious private consulting firm, using a source name designed to have low perceived legitimacy. It had been expected from previous research that only the FITD technique would successfully produce compliance under these circumstances, and that the FITD compilers would also yield higher ratings of the source's legitimacy than either the DITF or a control. This prediction was confirmed, but some evidence suggested that the source legitimacy question in the procedure also affected the compliance level of DITF subjects. © 1988 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Patch, M.A.",J.

Does government funding change behavior? An empirical analysis of crowd-out,"When governments introduce programs or funding for initiatives that are partially provided by lower levels of governments or in the private or third sectors, should the government be concerned about whether its efforts are crowded out by changes in behavior by individuals and institutions participating in the provision of this good or service? The bulk of the theoretical literature suggests that crowd-out is an issue. The ( historic) bulk of the empirical literature, however, has failed to find a measurable crowd-out effect. With better data and more sophisticated empirical techniques, there is a burgeoning literature that shows that crowd-out exists. The purpose of this paper is to examine the recent literature that studies the issue of crowd-out across a variety of venues to understand better the empirical estimation issues as well as the institutional details that can lead to a better understanding of the effects of government programs on individuals and organizations.","Payne, A.A.",Tax Policy Econ.,525

Specifically, I review research on compliance organized by the six classic principles of social influence (Cialdini, 2009)- reciprocity, commitment and consistency, authority, social validation or social proof, and liking and similarity, and examine how they are used to change peoples’ behaviors. Furthermore, this chapter reviews the mechanisms that underlie these principles, particularly mindlessness. Finally, this chapter concludes by examining whether this framework for understanding compliance applies to the new realm of social influence- social media- and calls for more research on the effectiveness of the principles of influence when the mode of interpersonal interaction is software based rather than in person. © Oxford University Press 2017.

Maxims nudge equitable or efficient choices in a Trade-Off Game,"The core problem in the distribution dilemma is the trade-off between equity and efficiency. With the development of socio-economic conditions, the optimal decision changes between equitable and efficient options. The methods for nudging decision-makers to make optimal decisions without changing the event are extremely important. This study used two laboratory behavior experiments to explore the impact of maxim information on the trade-off between equity and efficiency. The study explores whether stake levels and division schemes affect the nudging effect of the maxim in a Trade-Off Game (TOG). We found that participants were affected by maxim information in decision-making scenarios, and participants showed different equity preferences as the maxim information changed, without relevance of the stake level. Additionally, the nudging effect of the maxim only exists under the condition that the distributor's interests is not affected. Copyright: © 2020 Huang et al.

"A systematic review of the implementation of recommended psychological interventions for schizophrenia: Rates, barriers, and improvement strategies","PURPOSE: A systematic review of the literature exploring if the UK recommendations for psychological interventions for schizophrenia were being met was carried out. Rates of implementation for cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and family intervention (FI) were compared. The barriers against implementation and described strategies aimed at improving implementation were reviewed. METHODS: A literature search of electronic bibliography databases (Psychinfo, Medline, Pubmed, AMED, CINHAL, and EMBASE), reference and citation lists, the Evaluation and Review of NICE Implementation (ERNIE) database, a manual search of Clinical Psychology Forum, governmental reports, charity, and service user group reports was conducted. RESULTS: Twenty-six articles met the inclusion criteria, 11 provided data on implementation rates, 13 explored the barriers to implementation, and 10 gave information about improvement strategies. Rates of implementation varied from 4% to 100% for CBT and 0% to 53% for FI, and studies varied in the methodology used and quality of the articles. Previously reported barriers to implementation were found, with organisational barriers being most commonly followed by barriers met by staff members and service users. Implementation strategies discovered included training packages for CBT, FI, and psychosocial interventions as well as empirical evidence suggesting methods for engagement with service users. CONCLUSIONS: Rates of implementation for CBT and FI are still below recommended levels with wide variation of rates found. This suggests inequalities in the provision of psychological interventions for schizophrenia are still present. Previously identified barriers to implementation were confirmed. Attempted implementation strategies have been met with modest success. PRACTITIONER POINTS: Inequalities in the provision of psychological therapies for schizophrenia persist. Good quality cognitive behavioural therapy and FI training do not ensure implementation. Collaboration at all levels of healthcare is needed for effective implementation.","Ince, Paul; Haddock, Gillian; Tai, Sara",Psychol. Psychother.,530
Effect of an audience in public goods provision,"This paper investigates a novel public goods game where contributions to the public goods require effort that is observable. When the players are observed, they exert more effort to contribute to the public goods, and free-riding diminishes significantly compared to the no observer case. These effects are absent when no effort is required in order to contribute to the public goods. Furthermore, in the presence of an audience, the contributions to the public goods do not diminish when the game is repeated in the effort-required environment. Being observed does not affect the performance of the players if there is no strategic aspect of the game, in other words, when they play a private goods game.

The importance of spatial heterogeneity and self-restraint on mutualism stability - a quantitative review,"Understanding the factors that enable mutualisms to evolve and to subsequently remain stable over time, is essential to fully understand patterns of global biodiversity and for evidence based conservation policy. Theoretically, spatial heterogeneity of mutualists, through increased likelihood of fidelity between cooperative partners in structured populations, and 'self-restraint' of symbionts, due to selection against high levels of virulence leading to short-term host overexploitation, will result in either a positive correlation between the reproductive success of both mutualists prior to the total exploitation of any host resource or no correlation after any host resource has been fully exploited. A quantitative review by meta-analysis on the results of 96 studies from 35 papers, showed no evidence of a significant fitness correlation between mutualists across a range of systems that captured much taxonomic diversity. However, when the data were split according to four categories of host: 1) cnidarian corals, 2) woody plants, 3) herbaceous plants, and 4) insects, a significantly positive effect in corals was revealed. The trends for the remaining three categories did not significantly differ to zero. Our results suggest that stability in mutualisms requires alternative processes, or mechanisms in addition to, spatial heterogeneity of hosts and/or 'self-restraint' of symbionts.","Wang, Rui-Wu; Dunn, Derek W; Luo, Jun; He, Jun-Zhou; Shi, Lei",Sci.

Exploring the Trade-Offs Local Governments Make in the Pursuit of Economic Growth and Equity,"Economic development at the municipal level often necessitates that local governments make trade-offs between firm- and locality-based strategies. In recent decades, economic development researchers have described these efforts over time as exhibiting certain patterns and metaphors: as a series of waves, as embodying a type of lock-in effect, and as a policy layering process; however, the mechanisms behind these patterns remain unclear. This article draws upon 30 years of economic development policy decision making across the United States to understand what leads local governments to prioritize growth- or equity-oriented policies. We find that equity-enhancing economic development policies are more likely when local governments face less competitive pressure, have greater resource capacities, and experience greater intergovernmental involvement in the economic development planning process. Leveraging these factors can aid governments as they struggle to navigate a more sustainable path toward growth and equity. © The Author(s) 2020.","Stokan, E.; Deslatte, A.; Hatch, M.E.",Urban Aff.

The power of moral words: Loaded language generates framing effects in the extreme dictator game,"Understanding whether preferences are sensitive to the frame has been a major topic of debate in the last decades. For example, several works have explored whether the dictator game in the give frame gives rise to a different rate of pro-sociality than the same game in the take frame, leading to mixed results. Here we contribute to this debate with two experiments. In Study 1 (N=567) we implement an extreme dictator game in which the dictator either gets $0.50 and the recipient gets nothing, or the opposite (i.e., the recipient gets $0.50 and the dictator gets nothing). We experimentally manipulate the words describing the available actions using six terms, from very negative (e.g., stealing) to very positive (e.g., donating) connotations. We find that the rate of pro-sociality is affected by the words used to describe the available actions. In Study 2 (N=221) we ask brand new participants to rate each of the words used in Study 1 from “extremely wrong” to “extremely right”. We find that these moral judgments can explain the framing effect in Study 1. In sum, our studies provide evidence that framing effects in an extreme Dictator game can be generated using morally loaded language. © 2019.

General evaluability theory,"A central question in psychology and economics is the determination of whether individuals react differently to different values of a cared-about attribute (e.g., different income levels, different gas prices, and different ambient temperatures). Building on and significantly extending our earlier work on preference reversals between joint and separate evaluations, we propose a general evaluability theory (GET) that specifies when people are value sensitive and when people mispredict their own or others' value sensitivity. The GET can explain and unify many seemingly unrelated findings, ranging from duration neglect to affective forecasting errors and can generate many new research directions on topics ranging from temporal discounting to subjective well-being. © The Author(s) 2010.","Hsee, C.K.; Zhang, J.",Perspect.

The use and impact of incentives in population-based smoking cessation programs: a review,"PURPOSE: This review discusses current published literature on population-based smoking cessation interventions that involve incentives and examines whether such interventions are effective in reducing the prevalence of smoking. SEARCH METHOD: Studies published between 1975 and Spring 1997 were identified through a computerized search of four electronic databases (MEDLINE, HEALTH, CINAHL, and PSYCINFO) and reference lists of key articles using the following key words: (smoking cessation OR quit smoking) AND (contest OR competition OR incentive OR lottery OR quit and win). This search yielded 79 articles. To be included, studies had to be published in English and had to have presented either quit rates or participation rates for an incentive-based program that used population-based recruitment. Of the 79 articles, 17 met these criteria. FINDINGS: Population-based interventions generally attract 1 to 2% of the target population, but these participation rates can potentially be increased through the use of innovative recruitment techniques. No specific type of recruitment strategy was shown to be consistently more effective than others. There is no evidence that particular types of incentives are able to influence participation or quit rates, but the size of an incentive does appear to be important, with larger incentives viewed as more effectively motivating smokers to quit and stay smoke free than smaller ones. Estimates of the cost per quitter have ranged from less than $20 to over $400. There are some indications that the costs of such programs compare favorably with smoking cessation classes or clinic-based approaches. CONCLUSION: Incentive-based smoking cessation programs that target an entire community have the advantage of reaching a large and diverse group of smokers. They may, however, attract only smokers who are already motivated to quit. Realistically, incentive-based programs aimed at the general population can expect 1% of all their smokers to quit smoking. Quit rates among participants may initially be high (i.e., mean quit rate of 34% at 1-month follow-up) but decrease over time (i.e., mean rate of 23% at 1 year). The results of this review suggest a continued need to establish standard and valid criteria for the evaluation of smoking cessation interventions. Methodological differences among existing studies make them difficult to compare and interpret.","Bains, N; Pickett, W; Hoey, J",Am. J. Health Promot.,538

Gender differences in giving and the anticipation regarding giving in dictator games,"Research on altruistic behaviour and associated anticipatory beliefs, as well as related gender differences, is limited. Using data from Chowdhury and Jeon, who vary a common show-up fee and incentivize recipients to anticipate the amount given in a dictator game, we find that the show-up fee has a positive effect on dictator-giving for both genders. While female dictators are more generous than males, male recipients anticipate higher amounts than the amount male dictators give. As the show-up fee increases, the female dictators become a more generous social type, whereas males do not show this effect. There is no gender difference in anticipation about dictator social type by the recipients. © 2020 Oxford University Press 2020.

"Match quality, crowding out, and crowding in: empirical evidence for German sports clubs","Volunteering can be interpreted as a process of search. Using novel data from an online questionnaire study of volunteers of German sports clubs, we constructed a match quality index (MQI) that measures the outcome of this search process: the congruence of motives for doing volunteer work and the utility experiences derived from volunteer work. The MQI is higher on average for volunteers who would increase their work effort provided their sports club receives additional public subsidies or other volunteers increase their work (crowding-in effect). The MQI is also higher on average for volunteers who would increase their work effort in case other volunteers decrease their work (crowding-out effect). Furthermore, the MQI exhibits a positive correlation with volunteer satisfaction, labour supply, and volunteers’ confidence that they meet the requirements of their volunteer positions. The MQI is positively correlated with a bridging, but also with a bonding component of social capital. © 2018, © 2018 European Association for Sociology of Sport.","Behrens, C.; Emrich, E.; Hämmerle, M.; Pierdzioch, C.",European J.

Are women less selfish than men?: Evidence from dictator experiments,"Research in social sciences other than economics indicates substantial differences in behaviour between men and women. The general conclusion drawn from this work is that women will be more socially-orientated (selfless), and men more individually-orientated (selfish). This paper reports the results of a double-anonymous dictator experiment designed to permit the emergence of basic gender differences in economic behaviour. Our results are intended to provide a baseline for further research. We find that women, on average, donate twice as much as men to their anonymous partners when any factors that might confound cooperation are eliminated.","Eckel, C.C.; Grossman, P.J.",Econ. J.,543

How selfish is a thirsty man? A pilot study on comparing sharing behavior with primary and secondary rewards,"Human social interactions in daily life involve sharing various types of rewards. Previous research evolving around issues of selfish versus altruistic behavior indicates that when individuals share rewards like money with powerless others, some are purely selfish while a substantial number shares evenly. It is, however, mostly unknown how they share primary rewards like water, compared to secondary rewards like money. We adopt the widely studied Dictator Game for comparing water to be divided among study participants with a monetary reward. We show that thirsty participants share water more often equally with powerless, anonymous others than they do money. This is the case even when they earned both types of rewards in a preceding task. Results indicate that altruistic behavior is more likely to occur when it comes to sharing primary rewards. The ecologically more valid scenario employed in this study provides initial evidence that the concept of a self-interested homo economicus might not apply to everyday social interactions involving rewards other than money. © 2018 Kause et al.

Music-assisted relaxation to improve sleep quality: meta-analysis,"Music-assisted relaxation was an effective aid for improving sleep quality in patients with various conditions. XCM: The authors defined inclusion criteria for patients, intervention, outcomes and study designs. The search encompassed a range of databases, but did not include unpublished material and the authors could not rule out publication bias. Quality was assessed by two reviewers; it was unclear whether more than one reviewer was involved in study selection and data extraction (which would have helped minimise bias). Pooled studies were clinically diverse. There was some investigation of heterogeneity through subgroup and regression analysis. Although the overall conclusion appeared to be supported by the evidence presented, the most effective form and type of music intervention for different populations remained to be determined. XIM: Practice: The authors stated that since no adverse effects were reported, nurses could use the findings of the review in practice to promote music-assisted relaxation. The intervention could be used without extensive investment in training and materials and was cheap and readily available.Research: The authors stated that the role of music in a multifaceted intervention that combined cognitive-behavioural and/or educational elements required further exploration. Future studies should assess both objective and subjective outcome measures of sleep quality and it would be of interest to determine the most effective form of music intervention and type for different populations. Future studies should have strict inclusion criteria based on a good definition of the sleep problem.","de Niet, G; Tiemens, B; Lendemeijer, B; Hutschemaekers, G",,546
"Taxes, Subsidies, and Listeners Like You: Public Policy and Contributions to Public Radio","Public radio in the United States receives both direct and indirect government funding. Direct subsidies come in the form of lump-sum and matching grants, while indirect subsidies proceed from tax revenues forgone on tax-deductible private donations. Each of these sources of government money affects charitable giving to public radio. This article estimates both of these effects, using data on 91 public radio stations in the United States during 1995. Data analysis shows that public funding to stations has a positive impact on private giving, but this impact rapidly decreases as the level of government subsidies increases. The analysis also indicates that increases in state tax rates correspond with significantly higher donation levels. This article explores the implications of these and other findings for policy makers, public administrators, and nonprofit managers.","Brooks, A.C.",Public Adm. Rev.,547

Do ‘watching eyes’ influence antisocial behavior? A systematic review & meta-analysis,"Eye cues have been shown to stimulate rapid, reflexive, unconscious processing and in many experimental settings to cue increased prosocial and decreased antisocial behaviour. Eye cues are being widely applied in public policy to reduce crime and antisocial behaviour. Recently, failed replication attempts and two meta-analyses examining the eye cue effect on generosity have raised doubts regarding earlier findings. Much of the wider evidence on eye cues has still not been systematically reviewed, notably that which is most relevant to its practical application: the effect of eye cues on antisocial behaviour. Given the evidence of humans’ heightened sensitivity to threat and negative information, we hypothesized that the watching eyes effect would be more consistent in studies examining antisocial behaviour. In our meta-analysis of 15 experiments from 13 research papers we report a reduction in the risk of antisocial behaviour of 35% when eye cues are present. By contrast, systematic reviews have suggested CCTV cameras reduce crime by only 16%. We conclude that there is sufficient evidence of a watching eyes effect on antisocial behaviour to justify their use in the very low-cost and potentially high-impact real-world interventions that are proliferating in public policy, particularly in the UK. Public significance statement: Our meta-analysis of 15 experiments involving 2035 participants shows that photographs and/or stylized images of eyes reduced antisocial behaviour by 35%. Our findings support public policy initiatives employing pictures of ‘watching eyes’ to reduce crime. Furthermore, in an age when we are watched more than at any time in modern history – both online and on the street – our findings highlight an urgent need to fully understand the effect that perceived surveillance, feeling watched, has on our decisions and actions. © 2019 The Authors","Dear, K.; Dutton, K.; Fox, E.",Evol.

The 'crowding-out' effect of governmental transfers on private charitable contributions,"The above analysis provides support for the proposition that governmental social-welfare transfers have actually served to attenuate private charitable giving. Our finding of less-than-total crowding out tends to reject both the ultrarational and BGR hypotheses for society as a whole. However, our results do not preclude the possibility that some contributors have been completely crowded out nor that some contributors have been unaffected by increases in governmental transfers. The highly aggregative data used in this study may conceal substantially different crowding-out effects for particular types of charitable contributions. Further investigation using microeconomic or less aggregative data should help to identify the categories of private charitable contributions most affected by the growth of governmental transfers. © 1978 Martinus Nijhoff Social Sciences Division.","Abrams, B.A.; Schitz, M.D.",Public Choice,554
"The Effect of $1, $5 and $10 Stakes in an Online Dictator Game","The decision rules underpinning human cooperative behaviour are often investigated under laboratory conditions using monetary incentives. A major concern with this approach is that stake size may bias subjects' decisions. This concern is particularly acute in online studies, where stakes are often far lower than those used in laboratory or field settings. We address this concern by conducting a Dictator Game using Amazon Mechanical Turk. In this two-player game, one player (the dictator) determines the division of an endowment between himself and the other player. We recruited subjects from India and the USA to play an online Dictator Game. Dictators received endowments of $1, $5 or $10. We collected two batches of data over two consecutive years. We found that players from India were less generous when playing with a $10 stake. By contrast, the effect of stake size among players from the USA was very small. This study indicates that the effects of stake size on decision making in economic games may vary across populations. © 2013 Raihani et al.","Raihani, N.J.; Mace, R.; Lamba, S.",PLoS ONE,555

Getting More by Asking for Less: The Effects of Request Size on Donations of Charity,"In the context of an annual fundraising drive for the American Society, two field experiments were conducted to test the relative effectiveness of suggesting either small or large contributions. In experiment 1, as part of a door‐to‐door campaign 300 people were randomly assigned to: (a) a standard request for contributions (control); (b) the standard request plus the words, “even a penny will help”; or (c) the standard request plus the words, “a generous contribution would really help.” As hypothesized, asking for a generous contribution significantly decreased the percentage of people who donated and failed to increase the average size of contribution by those who gave. Inconsistent with previous findings, the even‐a‐penny condition did not increase donating. In the second experiment conceptually similar requests were made in a mail‐out campaign: 6,000 requests were made—2,000 suggested relatively small amounts (options beginning at $5); 2,000 suggested large amounts (options beginning at $5); and 2,000 were unspecified with regard to recommended amount (control). As expected, compared to the control condition, asking for small amounts increased the proportion of donors to nondonors without decreasing the average size of contributions, while asking for large amounts decreased the proportion of donors to nondonors without increasing the size of contributions. It is suggested that the findings have important implications for charitable fundraising. Copyright © 1987, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved","Weyant, J.M.; Smith, S.L.",J. Appl. Soc.

This issue is the first of two special issues and focuses on the role that individual processes play in influencing young adolescents? prosocial and moral development. Presented also is a new meta-analysis of data on age and gender differences in prosocial behavior with particular focus on early adolescence. It was found that prosocial behavior during adolescence rarely has been studied, but that there are general increases in prosocial behavior during this time when compared with early age periods. Moreover, gender differences in prosocial behavior (favoring girls) increase during this time. A relatively short review of the individual mechanisms by which these changes occur follow.

The hidden costs of the door-in-the-face tactic in negotiations,"Past studies have shown that Door-in-the-face tactics can induce compliance from negotiators. This research examines the hidden costs of the use of the Door-in-the-face tactic in dyadic negotiations. It shows that learning about opponents’ use of this tactic affects negotiators’ feelings of mistreatment and their behaviours in the subsequent negotiation. It also induces negotiators’ covert, retaliatory behaviour. The results showed that negotiators who had dealt with opponents using the Door-in-the-face tactic made larger demands and attained higher outcomes in the subsequent negotiation. It was also found that feelings of mistreatment by opponents tended to spread over into future negotiations. Feelings of mistreatment mediated the effect of opponents’ use of Doorin-the-face tactics on covert retaliation. Implications of results are discussed and directions for future research are given. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","Wong, R.S.",Lect. Notes Bus. Inf. Process.,562

Communal motivation and well-being in interpersonal relationships: An integrative review and meta-analysis,"The motivation to care for the welfare of others, or communal motivation, is a crucial component of satisfying interpersonal relationships and personal well-being. The current meta-analysis synthesized 100 studies (Ntotal = 26,645) on communal motivation to establish its associations with subjective personal well-being (e.g., life satisfaction, positive affect, and negative affect) and relationship well-being (e.g., relationship satisfaction, partner-oriented positive affect, and partner-oriented negative affect) for both the person providing communal care and their partner. Three types of communal motivation were examined, including general, partner-specific (for children, parents, romantic partners, and friends), and unmitigated (i.e., devoid of agency and self-oriented concern). Results revealed positive associations between all three forms of communal motivation and relationship well-being for the self (.11 ≤ rs ≤ .44) and relationship partners (.11 ≤ rs ≤ .15). However, only general and partner-specific communal motivation, and not unmitigated communal motivation, were linked with greater personal well-being for both the self (.12 ≤ rs ≤ .16) and relationship partners (.04 ≤ rs ≤ .09). These associations were generally consistent across gender, relationship length, publication status, and lab. Finally, relationship partners were similar in partner-specific (r = .26) and unmitigated (r = .15) communal motivation only. Findings from the current meta-analysis suggest that care for the welfare of others is linked to greater relationship well-being for both members of a relationship. However, communal care is only linked to personal well-being insofar as it is mitigated by a degree of self-oriented concern. We provide theoretical and power recommendations for future research.

Stakes matter in ultimatum games,"One of the most robust findings in experimental economics is that individuals in oneshot ultimatum games reject unfair offers. Puzzlingly, rejections have been found robust to substantial increases in stakes. By using a novel experimental design that elicits frequent low offers and uses much larger stakes than in the literature, we are able to examine stakes' effects over ranges of data that are heretofore unexplored. Our main result is that proportionally equivalent offers are less likely to be rejected with high stakes. In fact, our paper is the first to present evidence that as stakes increase, rejection rates approach zero.","Andersen, S.; Ertaç, S.; Gneezy, U.; Hoffman, M.; List, J.A.",Am. Econ. Rev.,565
The weirdest people in the world?,"Behavioral scientists routinely publish broad claims about human psychology and behavior in the world's top journals based on samples drawn entirely from Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic (WEIRD) societies. Researchers-often implicitly-assume that either there is little variation across human populations, or that these standard subjects are as representative of the species as any other population. Are these assumptions justified? Here, our review of the comparative database from across the behavioral sciences suggests both that there is substantial variability in experimental results across populations and that WEIRD subjects are particularly unusual compared with the rest of the species-frequent outliers. The domains reviewed include visual perception, fairness, cooperation, spatial reasoning, categorization and inferential induction, moral reasoning, reasoning styles, self-concepts and related motivations, and the heritability of IQ. The findings suggest that members of WEIRD societies, including young children, are among the least representative populations one could find for generalizing about humans. Many of these findings involve domains that are associated with fundamental aspects of psychology, motivation, and behavior-hence, there are no obvious a priori grounds for claiming that a particular behavioral phenomenon is universal based on sampling from a single subpopulation. Overall, these empirical patterns suggests that we need to be less cavalier in addressing questions of human nature on the basis of data drawn from this particularly thin, and rather unusual, slice of humanity. We close by proposing ways to structurally re-organize the behavioral sciences to best tackle these challenges.

Ingroup favoritism in cooperation: a meta-analysis,"Although theory suggests individuals are more willing to incur a personal cost to benefit ingroup members, compared to outgroup members, there is inconsistent evidence in support of this perspective. Applying meta-analytic techniques, we harness a relatively recent explosion of research on intergroup discrimination in cooperative decision making to address several fundamental unresolved issues. First, summarizing evidence across studies, we find a small to medium effect size indicating that people are more cooperative with ingroup, compared to outgroup, members (d = 0.32). Second, we forward and test predictions about the conditions that moderate ingroup favoritism from 2 influential perspectives: a social identity approach and a bounded generalized reciprocity perspective. Although we find evidence for a slight tendency for ingroup favoritism through categorization with no mutual interdependence between group members (e.g., dictator games; d = 0.19), situations that contain interdependence result in stronger ingroup favoritism (e.g., social dilemmas; d = 0.42). We also find that ingroup favoritism is stronger when there is common (vs. unilateral) knowledge of group membership, and stronger during simultaneous (vs. sequential) exchanges. Third, we find support for the hypothesis that intergroup discrimination in cooperation is the result of ingroup favoritism rather than outgroup derogation. Finally, we test for additional moderators of ingroup favoritism, such as the percentage of men in the sample, experimental versus natural groups, and the country of participants. We discuss the implications of these findings for theoretical perspectives on ingroup favoritism, address implications for the methodologies used to study this phenomenon, and suggest directions for future research.","Balliet, Daniel; Wu, Junhui; De Dreu, Carsten K W",Psychol.

Either friends or strangers presented requests to the participants. Half the requests were in a door-in-the-face format, and the other half were single requests.

"Emotional reactions, perceived impact and perceived responsibility mediate the identifiable victim effect, proportion dominance effect and in-group effect respectively","This study investigated possible mediators of the identifiable victim effect (IVE), the proportion dominance effect (PDE), and the in-group effect (IGE) in helping situations. In Studies 1-3, participants rated their emotional reactions (distress and sympathy toward the victims), perceived impact of helping, perceived responsibility to help, and helping motivation toward four versions of a helping situation. Gradually increasing victim identifiability in the helping situations primarily affected emotional reactions and sympathy completely mediated the IVE. Gradually making the reference-group smaller primarily affected perceived impact, and impact completely mediated the PDE. Gradually increasing in-groupness primarily affected perceived responsibility, and responsibility completely mediated the IGE. Study 4 included real monetary allocations and largely replicated the results using a between-subject design. Together, the results shed light on how contextual factors trigger help motivation, and indicate that different helping effects are primarily mediated by different mechanisms. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Erlandsson, A.; Björklund, F.; Bäckström, M.",Organ.

Altruistic punishment: The golden keystone of human cooperation and social stability?,"Altruistic punishment' (i.e., costly punishment that serves no instrumental goal for the punisher) could serve, as suggested by the pertinent experimental literature, as a powerful enforcer of social norms. This paper discusses foundations, extensions, and, in particular, limits and open questions of this concept-and it does so mostly based on experimental evidence provided by the author. Inter alia, the paper relates the (standard) literature on negative emotions as a trigger of second party punishment to more recent experimental findings on the phenomenon of 'spontaneous cooperation' and 'spontaneous punishment' and demonstrates its (tight) emotional basis. Furthermore, the paper discusses the potential for free riding on altruistic punishment. While providing valuable insights into the understanding of social order, 'altruistic punishment' is thus not the golden keystone of social stability. © 2020 De Gruyter Oldenbourg.

Using censored quantile regression analysis, we derive results for different points of the underlying distribution of charitable giving.

Cost effectiveness of epoetin-alpha to augment preoperative autologous blood donation in elective cardiac surgery,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess the cost effectiveness of using epoetin-alpha (erythropoietin) to augment preoperative autologous donation (PAD) of blood prior to elective cardiac surgery. DESIGN AND SETTING: We designed a decision-analytic model incorporating the risk of receiving allogeneic blood, the costs of blood products, the likelihood of developing transfusion-related diseases, the costs of transfusion-related diseases and their impact on life expectancy, and the effect of epoetin-alpha on the probability of transfusion. INTERVENTIONS: The efficacy of epoetin-alpha was derived from data from a meta-analysis of published randomised trials comparing the use of epoetin-alpha to augment PAD with the use of PAD alone. Estimates for the other parameters were obtained by a systematic review of the literature. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES AND RESULTS: The use of epoetin-alpha reduced the proportion of patients receiving allogeneic transfusions by 60% (from 31.6 to 12.7%). However, this led to only a modest benefit of 0.000035 life years gained per patient and an incremental cost per life year gained of $Can44.6 million (1998 Canadian dollars). A detailed sensitivity analysis confirmed that the cost-effectiveness ratio was larger than that which is generally considered acceptable. CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates that the use of epoetin-alpha to reduce perioperative allogeneic transfusions in cardiac surgery is not cost effective.","Coyle, D; Lee, K M; Fergusson, D A; Laupacis, A",Pharmacoeconomics,579

I Only Have Eyes for You: Does Implicit Social Pressure Increase Voter Turnout?,"Get-out-the-vote mailers using explicit social pressure consistently increase electoral turnout; however, they often generate a negative reaction or backlash. One approach to increase turnout, yet alleviate backlash, may be to use implicit social pressure. An implicit social pressure technique that has shown promise is to display a set of eyes. Researchers contend eyes generate a feeling of being watched, which cues subjects to act in more prosocial ways to demonstrate compliance with social norms. Several studies support this argument, including two voter mobilization studies. The technique has not been widely tested, however, in the political context. In five randomized field experiments, we test the impact on turnout of mobilization mailers using eye displays. We extend previous research by testing for differences in effects between male and female eyes and across political cultures. The effects are substantively and statistically weak at best and inconsistent with previous findings. © 2015 International Society of Political Psychology","Matland, R.E.; Murray, G.R.",Polit.

The Role of Feasibility and Desirability Considerations in Near and Distant Future Decisions: A Test of Temporal Construal Theory,"Temporal construal theory states that distant future situations are construed on a higher level (i.e., using more abstract and central features) than near future situations. Accordingly, the theory suggests that the value associated with the high-level construal is enhanced over delay and that the value associated with the low-level construal is discounted over delay. In goal-directed activities, desirability of the activity's end state represents a high-level construal, whereas the feasibility of attaining this end state represents a low-level construal. Study 1 found that distant future activities were construed on a higher level than near future activities. Studies 2 and 3 showed that decisions regarding distant future activities, compared with decisions regarding near future activities, were more influenced by the desirability of the end state and less influenced by the feasibility of attaining the end state. Study 4 presented students with a real-life choice of academic assignments varying in difficulty (feasibility) and interest (desirability). In choosing a distant future assignment, students placed relatively more weight on the assignment's interest, whereas in choosing a near future assignment, they placed relatively more weight on difficulty. Study 5 found that distant future plans, compared with near future plans, were related to desirability of activities rather than to time constraints.","Liberman, N.; Trope, Y.",J. Pers. Soc.

Assessment of the Fiji-Based Condom Social Marketing (CSM) Program,"This paper discusses the results of a systematic review of the Condom Social Marketing (CSM) program which was implemented in Fiji by a non-profit organization for a period of 5 years. The CSM program was introduced during a decade when Fiji was recording an escalating number of new Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infections. The aim of the program was to increase the awareness and utilization of safe sexual practices among the most vulnerable group—the youths—which had reported the highest incidences of sexually transmitted infections. Program assessment revealed that the CSM program had reportedly increased the acceptability, accessibility, and usage of their TRY TiME condoms in Fiji. We conducted a survey on a sample of sexually active people during January–February 2009 to examine their prevailing level of knowledge about HIV/AIDS, sexual behavior/practices, and risk perception. The results showed that, despite the high level of awareness about HIV/AIDS among survey participants, people did not consistently practice safe sexual behavior and commonly identified themselves as at low risk of acquiring HIV. This paper concludes that more extensive behavior change programs are needed in order to influence people to change their risky sexual practices and reassess their risk perceptions.

A Meta-Analytic Review of the Legitimization of Paltry Favors Compliance Strategy,"The legitimization of paltry favors compliance-gaining technique involves a phrase that validates a very small amount of requested aid. A random-effects meta-analysis was conducted to examine the effectiveness of the legitimization of paltry favors technique on the compliance rate, mean contribution amount per contributor, and total contribution amount. Results indicated that the legitimization of paltry favors technique significantly increased the compliance rate relative to a direct request control without markedly diminishing the mean contribution amount per contributor. In terms of total contribution amount, the legitimization of paltry favors technique was more successful than controls. Moderator analyses showed none of 14 identified moderators explained the relationship between technique use and compliance rate. Three variables (target request, time interval, and country), however, moderated the relationship between technique use and the mean contribution per contributor. Theoretical and practical implications for legitimization of paltry favors-based research are discussed.","Lee, Seyoung; Moon, Shin-Il; Feeley, Thomas Hugh",Psychol. Rep.,586
Group diversity's influence on sport teams and organizations: a meta-analytic examination and identification of key moderators,"Research question: The purpose of this study was to examine how group diversity was associated with subsequent outcomes, and whether these associations varied by the type of diversity, setting, sport role, or type of outcome.Research method: The authors implemented a meta-analytic technique to examine the influence of group diversity on a variety of outcomes.Results and findings: Results showed that overall group diversity has a positive effect on group outcomes (rc = .05; z-value = 4.53, p < .001; 95% CI: .03, .07). Sport role (administrator or coaches and players or exercisers), setting type (college athletics, professional sports, or non-profit sports), outcome type (organizational effectiveness, affective outcomes, or team performance) all served to moderate the relationship between team diversity and subsequent outcomes.Implications: The study found group diversity has positive effects on group effectiveness, though the effects are small. The findings are nevertheless instructive because they provide an effect size estimated across a wide range of investigations and suggest that group diversity is positively associated with important group outcomes. The pattern of results might encourage practitioners in sport organizations and professional teams to welcome diverse individuals in their groups by demonstrating this positive link between group diversity and group outcomes.

The role of place attachment in diminishing compassion fade in the time donation context,"This study conducted an experiment in the time donation context to test whether place attachment moderates the impact of compassion fade on intention to donate time for helping other people in need. In the experiment, a two-way ANCOVA considering altruistic values as a covariate revealed that the negative impact of the number of people in need (i.e., compassion fade) on time donation was significantly weaker in an emotionally attached place condition than in a general place condition. This study suggests that a greater understanding of the interaction between place attachment and compassion fade is critical in the time donation context. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Kim, M.; Kim, J.",J.

Keeping the lights on: How government funding concerns drive the advocacy agendas of nonprofit homeless service providers,"Human service nonprofits have historically played an important role in advocating on behalf of the vulnerable populations that they serve. Growth in privatization has led many scholars and practitioners to wonder if increased dependence on government funds would compromise this role. The objective of this study is to explore the relationship between government funding and advocacy participation, goals, and tactics through a qualitative investigation of advocacy involvement in the field of homeless services. Results demonstrate that having government funding is associated with managers being highly motivated to participate in advocacy in the hopes of solidifying funding relationships. As a result, advocacy goals are focused primarily on brokering resources and promoting the organization rather than substantive policy change or client representation. Furthermore, in order to be perceived as a legitimate partner to government, organizations reject confrontational methods and advocate as insiders. Overall, these findings indicate perceptions about advocacy may need to shift as increased reliance on government funding has made advocacy participation and participation in collaborative governance virtually indistinguishable. © 2012 The Author.","Mosley, J.E.",J.

The origins of altruism in offspring care,"The current review aims to unify existing views of altruism through an examination of the biological bases of a fundamental form of giving: altruistic responding. Altruistic responding is most salient during heroic acts of helping but is also observed any time one perceives another's distress or need, which in turn motivates one to help at a current cost to the self. Such aid is simple, observable across species, and rooted in the instincts and circuits that evolved to maximize inclusive fitness through the care of helpless offspring. By design, the system already biases aid to both kin and nonkin under conditions that are largely adaptive. These inherent benefits are also buttressed in primates and humans by known, later-arriving benefits to helping in groupliving animals. Evidence for the proposed homology between altruistic responding and offspring retrieval is presented through 10 key shared factors. Conceptually, both require (a) participation by nonmothers, (b) motor competence and expertise, (c) an adaptive opponency between avoidance and approach, and a facilitating role of (d) neonatal vulnerability, (e) salient distress, and (f) rewarding close contact. Physiologically, they also share neurohormonal support from (g) oxytocin, (h) the domain-general mesolimbocortical system, (i) the cingulate cortex, and (j) the orbitofrontal cortex. The framework intermixes ultimate and proximate levels of analysis and unifies existing views by assuming that even complex human behaviors reflect ancient mammalian neural systems that evolved to solve key problems in adaptive ways, with far-reaching consequences for even our most venerated human traits. © 2013 American Psychological Association.","Preston, S.D.",Psychol.

Responding to socially desirable and undesirable topics: Different types of response behaviour?,"Social desirability describes the tendency of respondents to present themselves in a more positive light than is accurate and is a serious concern in surveys. If researchers are better able to understand the underlying mechanisms responsible for social desirability bias, they may be able to devise ways to identify and correct for it. One possibility involves determining whether social desirability is more of a deliberate ‘editing’ of responses or an automatic, perhaps ‘self-deceptive’, act. Then researchers could potentially flag conspicuously fast or slow responses to improve data quality. We outline dual-process-related theoretical arguments for both scenarios and test their plausibility using data gathered in a tablet-based CASI survey of pre-service teachers in Germany that were asked to assess their suitability for their chosen profession. Our analysis involves the use of fixed-effects multilevel models that enable us to control for unobserved differences between respondent- and item-characteristics while also examining cross-level interactions between the predictors at various levels. Specifically, we examine the classic respondent- (i.e. need for social approval) and item-related characteristics (i.e. trait desirability) associated with social desirability bias, as well as the speed at which the respondents gave their answers. Doing so allows us to observe under what circumstances the respondents tended to overstate positive characteristics as well as understate negative ones. We find evidence for social desirability as an automatic as well as a deliberate response behaviour. However, the mechanism responsible for determining whether social desirability occurs automatically or deliberately seems to be whether the item content is desirable or undesirable. Desirable traits seem to elicit faster socially desirable responses whereas undesirable traits seem to elicit slower socially desirable responses. © The Author(s) 2019.","Andersen, H.; Mayerl, J.","Methods, Data, Analyses",600
The Establishment of Iranian DNA Bank for Genetic and Epigenetic Studies in Psychiatric Disorders,"Objectives: In most advanced countries, there are tissue, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA) banks which have been made to provide samples for researchers in order to speed up genetic studies in different medical disorders. This may save time and materials in comparison to self-governing projects that usually spend months to collect samples independently. In these banks patients are cautiously diagnosed based on international diagnostic criteria. Thus, the results are more reliable than scattered studies and meta-analysis can be done with the data generated in different laboratories using the same samples. Method: For the establishment of a DNA bank for psychiatric disorders in Iran, after clarifying the aims and signing the consent forms, 300 saliva samples were collected using Oragene DNA Kit from the patients diagnosed based on the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders (SCID-I). Related data to demographics, family history, date of disorder onset, duration of disorder, drugs in use and other variables were compiled and opportunity for future contacts was set to gather more information including the course of disorders. Results: A saliva bank for DNA extraction of 300 psychiatric patients suffering from schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, 30 ones relatives as well as 75 matched healthy control subjects for genetic and epigenetic studies was established. Conclusion: The opportunity for donation of DNA samples collected from Iranian psychiatric patients has been provided to be used in hundreds of national and international genetic studies.

Does meeting standards affect charitable giving? An empirical study of New York metropolitan area charities,"Charitable donations constitute a significant revenue source for many nonprofit organizations. To help donors decide which nonprofits to support, watchdog organizations such as the Better Business Bureau (BBB) Wise Giving Alliance have developed standards to promote wise giving. The effectiveness of these guides in channeling limited resources to the best-managed nonprofits is not widely studied. This research attempts to empirically investigate the effects of standards on public giving, controlling for factors that have documented effects on donations. Specifically, it regresses public support on the extent to which local nonprofits meet the standards of the Better Business Bureau Serving Metropolitan New York, Mid-Hudson and Long Island Regions, controlling for organization size, board size, service category, government funding, fundraising expense, and giving price. The study found that BBB standards have a positive effect on giving behavior. Meeting BBB standards is associated with higher levels of public support. Participating in assessment programs and striving to meet the standards are recommended for nonprofits seeking to improve funding through charitable contributions. Further study that extends the search for the mechanism that links meeting standards to improved donations is recommended.","Chen, G.",Nonprofit Manage. Leadersh.,602
Whose money is it anyway? Ingroups and distributive behavior,"Price theory is often used to explain reactions to rebates and subsidies that are meant to encourage charitable giving. This paper describes the results of a laboratory experiment that tests standard price theory alongside an alternative perspective based on research on the perceptions and behavior of ingroups. Using a modified dictator game, we find that rebates that decrease the price of giving only increase amounts given when they are exogenously funded by the experimenters. When rebates are funded by members of one's group, the decreased price of giving does not lead to increased amounts given. The result suggests that the presence of an ingroup mentality can mediate the relationship between giving and price. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","Chavanne, D.; McCabe, K.; Paganelli, M.P.",J. Econ. Behav.

"Eyes, More Than Other Facial Features, Enhance Real-World Donation Behavior","Humans often behave more prosocially when being observed in person and even in response to subtle eye cues, purportedly to manage their reputation. Previous research on this phenomenon has employed the “watching eyes paradigm,” in which adults displayed greater prosocial behavior in the presence of images of eyes versus inanimate objects. However, the robustness of the effect of eyes on prosocial behavior has recently been called into question. Therefore, the first goal of the present study was to attempt to replicate this effect. Additionally, it remains unclear whether the watching-eyes effect is driven specifically by reputation management (owing to the monitoring function of the eyes) or whether any cues indexing human presence more generally also have a similar effect. To address these questions, the current study compared prosocial behavior in the presence of eyes versus inanimate objects as well as other human features. The study was conducted as a field experiment at a children’s museum. Each week, the donation signs were changed to show eyes, noses, mouths, or chairs. Total donation amount and number of patrons per week were recorded. Participants donated more when they were exposed to eyes than to inanimate objects (chairs). We thus replicated the previously reported watching-eyes effect. Moreover, more money was donated when individuals were exposed to eyes than to more general cues of human presence (nose and mouth). The current findings suggest that eyes play a special role in promoting cooperation in humans, likely by serving as cues of monitoring and thus eliciting reputation management behavior. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Kelsey, C.; Vaish, A.; Grossmann, T.",Hum.

Why do we help? World change orientation as an antecedent of prosocial action,"World change orientation refers to the extent to which one individual attributes his or her prosocial action to the function of making the world a better place. In Study 1, we developed a scale to measure this world change orientation [world change scale (WCS)] and to analyze its theoretical structure as a distinctive motivational orientation. In Study 2, participants were presented with a situation of need and subsequently given an unexpected opportunity to get involved in prosocial behavior. We then tested the hypothesis that degree of involvement is predicted by WCS when the situation is framed in terms of improving the welfare of the world, but by empathic concern when the situation is framed in terms of improving the welfare of a concrete victim. The results of both studies suggest that WCS refers to a distinct motivational orientation, which affects prosocial behavior above and beyond other motives. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Oceja, L.; Salgado, S.",Eur.

The Applicability of the Door‐in‐the Face Technique when Established Behavioral Customs Exist,"The applicability of the door‐in‐the‐face technique was tested in a monetary donation context where established behavioral standards exist, and where the target person has standards by which to judge the legitimacy of the solicitor's demand. Based on the proposition that exaggerated initial requests might discredit the solicitor and thereby halt the give‐and‐take process, it was expected that (a) with legitimate initial requests, the probability of compliance with a request would be greater when preceded by a larger request than if presented alone; and that (b) with illegitimate initial requests, the probability of compliance with a second request would be smaller when preceded by a larger request than if presented alone. On the national collection day for the Association for the Rehabilitation of the Mentally Handicapped, 400 subjects were asked to contribute IL 10, 15, or 20. In the experimental groups, these amounts were preceded with requests for larger sums which were judged previously by a pretest to be considered legitimate or illegitimate. In the control groups, subjects were asked to contribute the same amounts, but no larger amounts were first requested. The replicability of the door‐in‐the‐face technique has been proven with requests for which established customs exist. However, the technique was only effective with legitimate initial requests. With initial requests that were previously judged as unreasonable, the technique had a “boomerang effect” and suppressed compliance. Copyright © 1979, Wiley Blackwell.

Public goods experiments without confidentiality: A glimpse into fund-raising,"Laboratory researchers in economics assiduously protect the confidentiality of subjects. Why? Presumably because they fear that the social consequences of identifying subjects and their choices would significantly alter the economic incentives of the game. But these may be the same social effects that institutions, like charitable fund-raising, are manipulating to help overcome free riding and to promote economic efficiency. We present an experiment that unmasks subjects in a systematic and controlled way. We show that, as intuition suggests, identifying subjects has significant effects. Surprisingly, we found that two supplemental conditions meant to mimic common fund-raising practices actually had the most dramatic influences on behavior. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Short-sighted greed? Focusing on the future promotes reputation-based generosity,"Long-term thinking and voluntary resource sharing are two distinctive traits of human nature. Across three experiments (N=1,082), I propose a causal connection: Sometimes people are generous because they think about the future. Participants were randomly assigned to either focus on the present or the future and then made specific decisions in hypothetical scenarios. In Study 1 (N=200), future-focused participants shared more money in a public dictator game than present-focused participants (+39%), and they were willing to donate more money to charity (+61%). Study 2 (N=410) replicated the positive effect of future-focus on dictator giving when the choice was framed as public (+36%), but found no such effect when the choice was framed as private. That is, focusing on the future made participants more generous only when others would know their identity. Study 3 was a high-powered and pre-registered replication of Study 1 (N=472), including a few extensions. Once again, future-focused participants gave more money to charity in a public donation scenario (+40%), and they were more likely to volunteer for the same charity (+17%). As predicted, the effect was mediated by reputational concern, indicating that future-orientation can make people more generous because it also makes them more attuned to the social consequences of their choices. Taken together, the results suggest that focusing on the future promotes reputation-based generosity. By stimulating voluntary resource sharing, a central function of human foresight might be to support cooperation in groups and society. © 2019, Society for Judgment and Decision making.

The effect of endogenous endowments: Evidence from a mini-ultimatum game,"We extend the mini ultimatum game to investigate the effect of two types of endogenous endowments: one created by real effort and one created by subjects' choices in a risky environment. Compared to an exogenous endowment, the probability of rejection for a given size endowment is more than 44% lower when responder effort generates the endowment. However, rejection rates differ across endowment sizes: the probability of rejecting a low offer increases with endowment size when the responder produces the endowment, and decreases with endowment size when the endowment is determined exogenously. The results differ considerably from the only other real-effort ultimatum game experiment, indicating that more research is needed in this area to better interpret why offers are rejected in the ultimatum game.","Carr, M.D.; Mellizo, P.",Econ.

Unseen sentinels: Local monitoring and control in conservation’s blind spots,"Although official on-the-ground environmental monitoring is absent over much of the world, many people living in these regions observe, manage, and protect their environment. The autonomous monitoring processes associated with these activities are seldom documented and appear poorly recognized by conservation professionals. We identified monitoring activities in three villages in the Mamberamo-Foja region (Mamberamo Regency) of Papua (Indonesian New Guinea). In each village we found evidence that local monitoring contributes to effective protection and deters unregulated exploitation. Although everyone gathers observations and shares information, there are also specific roles. For example, the Ijabait hereditary guardians live at strategic sites where they control access to resource-rich lakes and tributaries along the Tariku River. Often, monitoring is combined with and thus influences other activities: for example, hunting regularly includes areas judged vulnerable to incursions by neighboring communities. We identified various examples of community members intervening to prevent and deter outsiders from exploiting resources within their territories. Enforcement of rules and assessment of resource status also help prevent local overexploitation within the communities. Clearly, local people are effective in protecting large areas in a relatively natural state. We discuss the value of these autonomous monitoring and protection processes, their neglect, and the need for explicit recognition by those concerned about these people and their environments, as well as about conservation. We highlight a potential “tragedy of the unseen sentinels” when effective local protection is undermined not because these local systems are invisible, but because no one recognizes what they see. © 2015 by the author(s).","Sheil, D.; Boissière, M.; Beaudoin, G.",Ecol.

Three relevant databases were searched and efforts were made to locate unpublished studies by searching conference abstracts, but it was unclear if any language restrictions were applied. The data were extracted by two reviewers, but it was not reported if studies were selected in the same way, so there may have been some errors or bias. The authors stated that they assessed trial quality, but they did not report the methods and results, so the quality of the evidence is unclear. The meta-analysis methods seem to have been appropriate and sensitivity analyses were conducted to explore the possible reasons for the observed heterogeneity.There was little information on the intervention, and a lack of information on some review methods and study quality. The conclusions seem reasonable based on the results presented, but may not accurately reflect the long-term outcomes due to low event rates.

Guilt and expected guilt in the door-in-the-face technique,"Three studies are reported concerning the guilt-based explanation of the door-in-the-face (DITF) technique, which proposes that in successful DITF implementations, first-request refusal generates guilt that is reduced by second-request compliance. An initial experiment confirmed that, consistent with this explanation, rejection of a prosocial request evoked more guilt than did rejection of a nonprosocial request. A second experiment provided further confirmation that request rejection can elicit guilt in the expected ways, but found that second-request compliance did not provide the predicted guilt reduction. A third experiment suggested that second-request compliance may be motivated by the expectation that compliance will reduce guilt.","O'Keefe, D.J.; Figgé, M.",Commun. Monogr.,618
Prosocial modeling: A meta-analytic review and synthesis,"Exposure to prosocial models is commonly used to foster prosocial behavior in various domains of society. The aim of the current article is to apply meta-analytic techniques to synthesize several decades of research on prosocial modeling, and to examine the extent to which prosocial modeling elicits helping behavior. We also identify the theoretical and methodological variables that moderate the prosocial modeling effect. Eighty-eight studies with 25,354 participants found a moderate effect (g = 0.45) of prosocial modeling in eliciting subsequent helping behavior. The prosocial modeling effect generalized across different types of helping behaviors, different targets in need of help, and was robust to experimenter bias. Nevertheless, there was cross-societal variation in the magnitude of the modeling effect, and the magnitude of the prosocial modeling effect was larger when participants were presented with an opportunity to help the model (vs. a third-party) after witnessing the model's generosity. The prosocial modeling effect was also larger for studies with higher percentage of female in the sample, when other people (vs. participants) benefitted from the model's prosocial behavior, and when the model was rewarded for helping (vs. was not). We discuss the publication bias in the prosocial modeling literature, limitations of our analyses and identify avenues for future research.

Prior research showed that people are more willing to extend such help when the victims are identified, particularly when the target of help is a single individual. However, in the present research we found that only when the perceivers regard the victims as belonging to their own in-group, willingness to help a single identified individual is greater than willingness to help a group of individuals: identifying tsunami victims by name increased actual contributions only when the specified target was a single compatriot. The role of perceived shared social group in promoting the victim singularity advantage in contributions was mirrored in ratings of emotions, thus supporting an affective account of helping behavior. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

"Sadism, the intuitive system, and antisocial punishment in the public goods game","In public goods situations, a specific destructive behavior emerges when individuals face the possibility of punishing others: antisocial punishment, that is, costly punishing cooperative individuals. So far, littleis known about the (intuitive or reflective) processes underlying antisocial punishment. Building on the SocialHeuristics Hypothesis and arguing that antisocial punishment reflects the basic characteristics of sadism, namely, aggressive behavior to dominate and to harm other individuals it is assumed that everyday sadists intuitively engage in antisocial punishment. Two studies document that activating (Study 1) and inhibiting (Study 2) the intuitive system when a punishment option can be realized in one-shot iterated public goods games increased (Study 1) and reduced (Study 2) antisocial punishment, in particular among individuals who reported a proneness to sadism. In sum, the present research suggests that sadistic tendencies executed intuitively play a crucial role regarding antisocial punishment in public goods situations. © 2017 by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc.","Pfattheicher, S.; Keller, J.; Knezevic, G.",Pers.

"Social Motivation, Justice, and the Moral Emotions: An Attributional Approach","Social Motivation, Justice, and the Moral Emotions proposes an attribution theory of interpersonal or social motivation that distinguishes between the role of thinking and feeling in determining action. The place of this theory within the larger fields of motivation and attributional analyses is explored. It features new thoughts concerning social motivation on such topics as help giving, aggression, achievement evaluation, compliance to commit a transgression, as well as new contributions to the understanding of social justice. Included also is material on moral emotions, with discussions of admiration, contempt, envy, gratitude, and other affects not considered in Professor Weiner's prior work. The text also contains previously unexamined topics regarding social inferences of arrogance and modesty and the role of mediators versus moderators in theory building. Divided into five chapters, this book: *Considers the logical development and structure of a proposed theory of social motivation and justice; *Reviews meta-analytic tests of the theory within the contexts of help giving and aggression and examines issues related to cultural and individual differences; *Focuses on moral emotions including an analysis of admiration, envy, gratitude, jealousy, scorn, and others; *Discusses conditions where reward decreases motivation while punishment augments strivings; and *Provides applications that are beneficial in the classroom, in therapy, and in training programs. Social Motivation, Justice, and the Moral Emotions appeals to practicing and research psychologists and advanced students in a variety of fields including social, educational, personality, political/legal, health, and clinical psychology. It will also serve as a supplement in courses on motivational psychology, emotion and motivation, altruism and/or pro-social behavior, aggression, social judgment, and morality. Also included is the raw material (e.g., questionnaires, surveys, etc.) for 13 experiments relating to core predictions of the proposed attribution theory.","Weiner, Bernard","Social Motivation, Justice, and the Moral Emotions: An Attributional Approach",624
The relative effectiveness of gain-framed and loss-framed messages in charity advertising: Meta-analytic evidence and implications,"Meta-analysis is a primary avenue for the development of cumulative knowledge and an essential step in the process theory testing. It provides a more specific quantitative understanding of a subject while correcting for sampling and measurement errors. This project is a modest first attempt to extend existing meta-analytic work on the effect of gain- versus loss-framed messages to charity advertising research. A meta-analysis of 27 studies (k = 40, N = 9,298) finds that gain-framed and loss-framed appeals do not differ significantly on persuasiveness in charity advertising. The random-effects model reveals a mean r of.002 (95% CI −0.061–0.064, p =.96) after correcting for sampling and measurement errors. A re-analysis (k = 38) excluding two outliers yielded a mean r of.03 (95% CI −0.022–.073, p =.29). Among published studies (k = 32), there was tentative indication pointing to the slight advantage of gain-framed appeals. The framing effect does not differ by which type of donation the message calls for (monetary vs. organ), nor is it affected by moderators such as study setting and population. The little difference finding echoes previous conceptual and empirical work and calls for more work identifying moderating factors and boundary conditions on framing research. Practical implications and future directions are discussed. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Xu, J.; Huang, G.",Int. J. Nonprofit Volunt. Sect. Mark.,625
Body size phenotypes comprehensively assess cardiometabolic risk and refine the association between obesity and gut microbiota,"OBJECTIVE: The gut microbiota associates with obesity and related disorders, but recent meta-analyses have found that this association is, at best, of small effect. We argue that such analyses are flawed by the use of body mass index (BMI) as sole proxy for disease, and explore a classification method that distinguishes the cardiometabolic health status of individuals to look for more comprehensive associations between gut microbes and health. DESIGN: We analyzed a 441 community-dwelling cohort on which we obtained demographic and health information, anthropometry and blood biochemistry data that served to categorize participants according to BMI, cardiometabolic health status and body size phenotypes. In addition, the participants donated fecal samples from which we performed 16S rRNA gene sequencing to analyze the gut microbiota. RESULTS: We observed that health-related variables deteriorate with increased BMI, and that there are further discrepancies within a given BMI category when distinguishing cardiometabolically healthy and unhealthy individuals. Regarding the gut microbiota, both obesity and cardiovascular disease associate with reductions in α-diversity; having lean, healthy individuals the most diverse microbiotas. Moreover, the association between the gut microbiota and health stems from particular consortia of microbes; the prevalence of consortia involving pathobionts and Lachnospiraceae are increased in obese and cardiometabolically abnormal subjects, whereas consortia including Akkermansia muciniphila and Methanobrevibacter, Oscillospira and Dialister have higher prevalence in cardiometabolically healthy and normoweight participants. CONCLUSIONS: The incorporation of cardiometabolic data allows a refined identification of dissimilarities in the gut microbiota; within a given BMI category, marker taxa associated with obesity and cardiometabolic disease are exacerbated in individuals with abnormal health status. Our results highlight the importance of the detailed assessment and classification of individuals that should be carried out prior to the evaluation of obesity treatments targeting the gut microbiota.","de la Cuesta-Zuluaga, J; Corrales-Agudelo, V; Carmona, J A; Abad, J M; Escobar, J S",Int.

Professional Values: Results of a Scoping Review and Preliminary Canadian Survey,"Purpose : Physiotherapists in Canada do not have an agreed-on list of core professional values. The purpose of this study was to identify physiotherapy values using a scoping review and to preliminarily identify the core professional values important to Canadian physiotherapists. Method: We undertook (1) a comprehensive scoping review of the primary and grey literature and (2) a cross-sectional survey of Canadian physiotherapists attending the 2016 Canadian Physiotherapy Association Congress. We conducted Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid EMBASE, and CINAHL database and Internet searches to identify peer-reviewed and grey literature. Survey participants were asked to list two professional values that guided their practice. Thematic and content analyses were used to analyze the results of both activities. We combined the results of the scoping review and the survey. Results : A total of 23 Web sites and 11 primary articles were retained from the search; 88 physiotherapists participated in the survey. A final list of 10 professional values (accountability, advocacy, altruism, compassion and caring, equity, excellence, integrity, patient and client centred, respect, and social responsibility) was drawn up after analyzing the scoping review and survey. Conclusions: This study describes the first steps in the process of identifying a set of core professional values for Canadian physiotherapists. Although many of values identified in this survey aligned with values published in the literature, some were unique, and further investigation is required.","Boyczuk, Alana M; Deloyer, Jamie J; Ferrigan, Kyle F; Muncaster, Kevin M; Dal Bello-Haas, Vanina; Miller, Patricia A",Physiother.

True versus strategic fairness in a common resource dilemma: Evidence from the dual-process perspective,"Common resource dilemmas involve collectively coordinating individual choices to promote group efficiency. Equal division represents one of the most important coordination rules. Previous research suggests that individuals follow the equality rule for different reasons. Some individuals behave cooperatively out of their concern for other's welfare, whereas some individuals cooperate strategically to enhance personal gains. Building on the dual-process perspective, the authors aim to differentiate strategic fairness from true fairness in solving a resource dilemma. In four experiments, the effect of cognitive processing manipulations on individual harvesting behavior in a one-shot resource dilemma was tested against participants with different social values. Results consistently showed that prosocials, who value joint outcome and equality, requested significantly less money than did proselfs, who value personal gain. More importantly, prosocials in the intuition and deliberation conditions request similar amounts, whereas proselfs in the intuition condition request more money than those in the deliberation condition. The results were further validated by a follow-up meta-analysis based on the four experiments. The implications of the dual-process perspective for social coordination research are discussed. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Lu, S.; Au, W.-T.; Zhu, Y.; Jiang, F.",J. Behav. Decis. Mak.,628
Cost-Effectiveness Research in Anesthesiology,"Perioperative interventions aimed at decreasing costs and improving outcomes have become increasingly popular in recent years. Anesthesiologists are often faced with a choice among different treatment strategies with little data available on the comparative cost-effectiveness. We performed a systematic review of the English language literature between 1980 and 2014 to identify cost-effectiveness analyses of anesthesiology and perioperative medicine interventions. We excluded interventions related to critical care or pediatric anesthesiology, and articles on interventions not normally ordered or performed by anesthesiologists. Of the >5000 cost-effectiveness analyses published to date, only 28 were applicable to anesthesiology and perioperative medicine and met inclusion criteria. Multidisciplinary interventions were the most cost-effective overall; 8 of 8 interventions were ""dominant"" (improved outcomes, reduced cost) or cost-effective, including accelerated, standardized perioperative recovery pathways, and perioperative delirium prevention bundles. Intraoperative measures were dominant in 3 of 5 cases, including spinal anesthesia for benign abdominal hysterectomy. With regard to prevention of perioperative infection, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) decolonization was dominant or cost-effective in 2 of 2 studies. Three studies assessing various antibiotic prophylaxis regimens had mixed results. Autologous blood donation was not found to be cost-effective in 5 of 7 studies, and intraoperative cell salvage therapy was also not cost-effective in 2 of 2 reports. Overall, there remains a paucity of cost-effectiveness literature in anesthesiology, particularly relating to intraoperative interventions and multidisciplinary perioperative interventions. Based on the available studies, multidisciplinary perioperative optimization interventions such as accelerated, standardized perioperative recovery pathways, and perioperative delirium prevention bundles tended to be most cost-effective. Our review demonstrates that there is a need for more rigorous cost-effective analyses in many areas of anesthesiology and that anesthesiologists should continue to lead collaborative, multidisciplinary efforts in perioperative medicine.","Teja, Bijan J; Sutherland, Tori N; Barnett, Sheila R; Talmor, Daniel S",Anesth.

Goodness-of-fit test for meta-analysis,"Meta-analysis is a very useful tool to combine information from different sources. Fixed effect and random effect models are widely used in meta-analysis. Despite their popularity, they may give us misleading results if the models dona't fit the data but are blindly used. Therefore, like any statistical analysis, checking the model fitting is an important step. However, in practice, the goodness-of-fit in meta-analysis is rarely discussed. In this paper, we propose some tests to check the goodness-of-fit for the fixed and random effect models with assumption of normal distributions in meta-analysis. Through simulation study, we show that the proposed tests control type I error rate very well. To demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed tests, we also apply them to some real data sets. Our study shows that the proposed tests are useful tools in checking the goodness-of-fit of the normal models used in meta-analysis.","Chen, Zhongxue; Zhang, Guoyi; Li, Jing",Sci. Rep.,633
‘She is looking at me! Shall I share?’ How Chinese and American preschoolers respond to eye gaze during sharing,"Previous research shows that the recipient's verbal communication about desires increases young children's sharing behavior. The current study examined how an adult partner's non-verbal communication through eye gaze influenced sharing behavior in children from different cultures. We presented one hundred forty-six 3- to 5-year-old American and Chinese children with a Dictator Game, in which they were asked to distribute resources between themselves and an experimenter. Children were randomly assigned to three conditions, in which the experimenter alternated her gaze between the child and the items that she wanted, or looked randomly around the room, or left when the child made decisions about sharing but claimed to come back later. Results showed that Chinese children shared more than American children did in the alternating-gaze condition, but not in the other two conditions; furthermore, the experimenter's alternating gaze influenced Chinese children to be more generous, but had no significant effect on American children. This suggests that compared to American children, Chinese children may be more compliant with others’ requests communicated through a subtle cue of eye gaze. The study demonstrates important differences in sharing behaviors between American and Chinese preschoolers, and these differences are consistent with the cultural constructs of individualism and collectivism. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Wu, Z.; Chen, X.; Gros-Louis, J.; Su, Y.",Soc.

"Self-Interest and Other-Orientation in Organizational Behavior: Implications for Job Performance, Prosocial Behavior, and Personal Initiative","In this article, the authors develop the self-concern and other-orientation as moderators hypothesis. The authors argue that many theories on work behavior assume humans to be either self-interested or to be social in nature with strong other-orientation but that this assumption is empirically invalid and may lead to overly narrow models of work behavior. The authors instead propose that self-concern and other-orientation are independent. The authors also propose that job performance, prosocial behavior, and personal initiative are a function of (a) individual-level attributes, such as job characteristics when employees are high in self-concern, and (b) group-level attributes, such as justice climate when employees are high in other-orientation. Three studies involving 4 samples of employees from a variety of organizations support these propositions. Implications are discussed for theory on work behavior and interventions geared toward job enrichment and team-based working. © 2009 American Psychological Association.","De Dreu, C.K.W.; Nauta, A.",J.

"Perception accuracy, biases and path dependency in longitudinal social networks","Most studies on perceptions of social structures in organizations rely on cross-sectional evidence and lack a longitudinal perspective. In order to address this gap, we collected whole network perception data at three time points from a cohort of MBA students. First, we asked whether or not individuals become more accurate in their perception of the network over time. We found no significant increase in accuracy. Second, we examined one’s perception of his or her own direct ties and found a consistent tendency to inflate incoming friendship ties, confirming existing studies. However, we find that individuals were quite capable of recognizing the broader dynamics of social hierarchy (i.e., whether they were becoming more or less popular) even as they became no more accurate in understanding either the overall networks or their own ego-net. Third, we explored possible explanations for the persistence of perception errors and showed that most of the errors at time point two and time point three were due to a failure to update previous perception decisions. Finally, we shifted the analysis from accuracy at a given time point and considered the narrative arc of dyadic relations. Our findings suggest that stable dyads across time are more likely to be accurately perceived whereas other types of dyads are poorly tracked. We conclude by presenting possible research questions for future studies to further our understanding of the temporal aspects of network perception. © 2019 Ertan et al.

Risking your life without a second thought: Intuitive decision-making and extreme altruism,"When faced with the chance to help someone in mortal danger, what is our first response? Do we leap into action, only later considering the risks to ourselves? Or must instinctive self-preservation be overcome by will-power in order to act? We investigate this question by examining the testimony of Carnegie Hero Medal Recipients (CHMRs), extreme altruists who risked their lives to save others. We collected published interviews with CHMRs where they described their decisions to help. We then had participants rate the intuitiveness versus deliberativeness of the decision-making process described in each CHMR statement. The statements were judged to be overwhelmingly dominated by intuition; to be significantly more intuitive than a set of control statements describing deliberative decision-making; and to not differ significantly from a set of intuitive control statements. This remained true when restricting to scenarios in which the CHMRs had sufficient time to reflect before acting if they had so chosen. Text-analysis software found similar results. These findings suggest that highstakes extreme altruism may be largely motivated by automatic, intuitive processes. Copyright: © 2014 Rand, Epstein.","Rand, D.G.; Epstein, Z.G.",PLoS ONE,639
How Children Solve the Two Challenges of Cooperation,"In this review, I propose a new framework for the psychological origins of human cooperation that harnesses evolutionary theories about the two major problems posed by cooperation: generating and distributing benefits. Children develop skills foundational for identifying and creating opportunities for cooperation with others early: Infants and toddlers already possess basic skills to help others and share resources. Yet mechanisms that solve the free-rider problem--critical for sustaining cooperation as a viable strategy--emerge later in development and are more sensitive to the influence of social norms. I review empirical studies with children showing a dissociation in the origins of and developmental change seen in these two sets of processes. In addition, comparative studies of nonhuman apes also highlight important differences between these skills: The ability to generate benefits has evolutionary roots that are shared between humans and nonhuman apes, whereas there is little evidence that other apes exhibit comparable capacities for distributing benefits. I conclude by proposing ways in which this framework can motivate new developmental, comparative, and cross-cultural research about human cooperation. Copyright ©2018 by Annual Reviews.

"Acceleration and augmentation of antidepressants with lithium for depressive disorders: two meta-analyses of randomized, placebo-controlled trials","OBJECTIVE: The delayed onset of therapeutic response and the high number of nonresponders to antidepressants remain major clinical problems in depressive disorders. Among the strategies to overcome both dilemmas, the additional treatment with lithium has been suggested as a viable method. The authors determined in 2 separate meta-analyses the efficacy of lithium in accelerating and in augmenting clinical response in patients with depression. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA SOURCES: Two meta-analyses of randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials including subjects with unipolar or bipolar disorder, depressive phase, assessed the concomitant administration of lithium and antidepressant to accelerate or augment clinical response in the acute treatment phase of depression. Data were obtained from searching the following databases: MEDLINE (1966 to July 2006), EMBASE (1989 to July 2006), and The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2006, Issue 3). For the accelerating meta-analysis, subject headings including depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, antidepressive agents, and lithium and text words such as depress*, lithium, and antidepress* were used. For the augmentation meta-analysis, subject headings included depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, anti-depressive agents, lithium, drug therapy, and combination, and text words included augment*, refract*, and resistant. Outcomes investigated included response rates and depression scale rates. DATA SYNTHESIS: Five acceleration studies (231 participants) adding lithium to tricyclics and tetracyclics and 10 augmentation studies (269 participants) adding lithium to various antidepressants including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors were incorporated. In the acceleration meta-analysis, a statistical trend in favor of lithium was found (standardized mean difference of -0.43, 95% CI = -0.93 to 0.07). In the augmentation meta-analysis, lithium was significantly more effective than placebo (odds ratio = 3.11, 95% CI = 1.80 to 5.37). CONCLUSION: There is firm evidence for lithium as an effective augmentation strategy but only modest evidence for lithium to accelerate response to antidepressants in patients with depressive disorders.","Crossley, Nicolas Andres; Bauer, Michael",J.

"The ""identified victim"" effect: An identified group, or just a single individual?","People's greater willingness to help identified victims, relative to non-identified ones, was examined by varying the singularity of the victim (single vs. a group of eight individuals), and the availability of individually identifying information (the main difference being the inclusion of a picture in the ""identified"" versions). Results support the proposal that the ""identified victim"" effect is largely restricted to situations with a single victim: the identified single victim elicited considerably more contributions than the non-identified single victim, while the identification of the individual group members had essentially no effect on willingness to contribute. Participants also report experiencing distress when the victim is single and identified more than in any other condition. Hence, the emotional reaction to the victims appears to be a major source of the effect. Copyright © 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Kogut, T.; Ritov, I.",J. Behav. Decis. Mak.,642

This study combines interorganizational relationships and organizational institutionalism literature to examine the determinants of nonprofits' obtainment of government funding. Based on a survey of human service nonprofits in Maryland, this research finds that nonprofits with higher bureaucratic orientation, stronger domain consensus with government, and longer government funding history are more likely to receive government contracts and grants.

Two small meta-analyses, both comprising six experiments investigating the effect of artificial surveillance cues on moral judgment, provided mixed conclusions. One meta-analysis produced a mean effect size not significantly different from zero and the other produced a mean effect size on the edge of significance. On the whole, artificial surveillance cues have inconsistent effects, or possibly no effect, on moral outcomes. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Northover, S.B.; Pedersen, W.C.; Cohen, A.B.; Andrews, P.W.",Evol.

Love or Comprehension? Exploring Strategies for Children’s Prosocial Media Effects,"Given children’s difficulty comprehending prosocial narratives, we examined strategies to bypass comprehension (affiliative priming) and reduce cognitive burden (simplified lessons, adult scaffolding). In Study 1, one hundred seven 3- to 5-year-olds watched a prosocial narrative (helping vs. waiting) with affective primes (loving vs. funny) or a control narrative. Comprehension was low and behavioral outcomes were unaffected by lesson or prime. In Study 2, sixty-four 3- to 5-year-olds watched shorter stimuli (1-minute song videos) about loving or helping others. Those in the helping condition helped more, but the loving condition did not differ from a no-exposure control. In Study 3, 636 parents of 2- to 10-year-olds were surveyed about a time their child showed prosocial responses to media. Over 70% recalled an instance, a third of which involved songs. Reported response duration was positively predicted by family discussions after exposure (rather than at the time), including explicating the lessons and giving timely reminders/praise. © The Author(s) 2018.","Mares, M.-L.; Bonus, J.A.; Peebles, A.",Commun.

Preferences for fairness over losses,"Economic decision making often involves determining how to share losses, or liabilities. While preferences for fairness over positive outcomes, i.e., gains, have been extensively studied, preferences for fairness over negative outcomes, i.e., losses, are largely unknown. Preferences for fairness over losses may differ from those over gains, given loss aversion and disutility from imposing losses on others (e.g., the do-no-harm principle). In two incentivized dictator game experiments, we examine altruism in two different frames – a loss condition and a gain condition. Study 1 shows that Dictators are more generous when splitting losses compared to gains. Study 2 shows that Dictator generosity in the loss condition substantially decreases when subjects are reminded of the payoff distribution resulting from their decisions. Our results support the idea that preferences for fairness over losses may differ from those over gains, underscoring the importance of studying preferences for fairness over losses and their determinants. © 2019","Thunström, L.",J.

Systematic review of the effectiveness of antenatal intervention for the treatment of congenital lower urinary tract obstruction,"Antenatal bladder drainage appeared to improve perinatal survival in cases of congenital lower urinary tract obstruction, but may confer a high residual risk of poor postnatal renal function based on observational studies. XCM: The review question and supporting inclusion criteria were clearly defined. A comprehensive literature search was performed without language restrictions, which reduced potential for language and publication biases. The likelihood of publication bias was assessed and found to be low. Two reviewers undertook trial selection, data extraction and validity assessment procedures, which reduced potential for reviewer bias and error. Validity was assessed using published criteria, but the criteria used to assess study quality were not reported in full; most studies had methodological shortcomings. It appeared that appropriate methods were used to pool the trials, although most analyses were based on a small number of studies and heterogeneity was not reported for all analyses. Subgroup analyses were conducted in an attempt to investigate heterogeneity. The review was generally well-conducted, but reliance on small observational studies of variable quality suggests that the authors’ caution in their conclusions is justified. XIM: Practice: The authors stated that current evidence was insufficient to dictate clinical practice. Research: The authors stated that randomised studies with long-term follow were required to investigate the role of antenatal treatment in clinical practice.","Morris, R K; Malin, G L; Khan, K S; Kilby",,649
National Sleep Foundation's sleep quality recommendations: first report,"OBJECTIVES: To provide evidence-based recommendations and guidance to the public regarding indicators of good sleep quality across the life-span. METHODS: The National Sleep Foundation assembled a panel of experts from the sleep community and representatives appointed by stakeholder organizations (Sleep Quality Consensus Panel). A systematic literature review identified 277 studies meeting inclusion criteria. Abstracts and full-text articles were provided to the panelists for review and discussion. A modified Delphi RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method with 3 rounds of voting was used to determine agreement. RESULTS: For most of the sleep continuity variables (sleep latency, number of awakenings >5minutes, wake after sleep onset, and sleep efficiency), the panel members agreed that these measures were appropriate indicators of good sleep quality across the life-span. However, overall, there was less or no consensus regarding sleep architecture or nap-related variables as elements of good sleep quality. CONCLUSIONS: There is consensus among experts regarding some indicators of sleep quality among otherwise healthy individuals. Education and public health initiatives regarding good sleep quality will require sustained and collaborative efforts from multiple stakeholders.

Giving from a distance: Putting the charitable organization at the center of the donation appeal,"Past research has shown repeatedly that people prefer donating to a single identified human victim rather than to unidentified or abstract donation targets. In the current research we show results countering the identifiable victim effect, wherein people prefer to donate to charitable organizations rather than to an identifiable victim. In a series of five studies, we manipulate temporal and social distance, examine a variety of donation targets, and measure intention to donate time or money as well as actual donations of money. We show that people are more willing to donate to a charitable organization when they are temporally or socially distant from the population in need. Willingness to donate to a specific person in need is higher when donors are temporally or socially close to the donation target. Furthermore, we demonstrate that (a) empathy mediates donations to a single victim, yet does not mediate donations to charitable organizations; (b) that donation giving to charitable organizations is unique and is not similar to donations to a group of victims.

Affecting the salience of the social responsibility norm: effects of past help on the response to dependency relationships,"A series of experiments by the authors assumes that many people in our society are motivated to aid others who are dependent upon them because such help is prescribed by a ""social responsibility norm."" The present study also assumes that prior help can increase the salience of this norm. In a 2 X 2 X 2 factorial design using 80 Ss (college women), 1/2 of the Ss were individually helped by a peer (E's confederate) on a preliminary task, while the others were not aided. After this, the Ss worked on another task under the supposed supervision of yet another peer, with 1/2 of the Ss being told the supervisor was highly dependent upon their work and the others told she was less dependent upon them. The 1st peer would supposedly learn of their work in 1/2 of the cases but not in the other 1/2. The previously helped Ss tended to exert the greatest effort in behalf of their dependent peer. A self-report scale assessing social responsibility tendencies was significantly correlated with the effort measure in the Prior Help-High Dependency condition.

The Effects of Financial Incentives in Experiments: A Review and Capital-Labor-Production Framework,"We review 74 experiments with no, low, or high performance-based financial incentives. The modal result is no effect on mean performance (though variance is usually reduced by higher payment). Higher incentive does improve performance often, typically judgment tasks that are responsive to better effort. Incentives also reduce ""presentation"" effects (e.g., generosity and risk-seeking). Incentive effects are comparable to effects of other variables, particularly ""cognitive capital"" and task ""production"" demands, and interact with those variables, so a narrow-minded focus on incentives alone is misguided. We also note that no replicated study has made rationality violations disappear purely by raising incentives.","Camerer, C.F.; Hogarth, R.M.",J. Risk Uncertainty,653

Willingness to participate in clinical trials among patients of Chinese heritage: a meta-synthesis,"BACKGROUND: Subjects of Chinese heritage have been found to participate in clinical research at lower rates than other groups despite growing in numbers as a population. While much research has examined research participants' motivation, there has not been a comprehensive synthesis of this information with respect to participants of Chinese descent. We sought to identify the factors that promote and hinder participation in clinical research among participants of Chinese heritage. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We conducted a systematic review of the literature in Pubmed, OpenJGATE, SCIRUS, and COCHRANE databases and performed a meta-synthesis of retrieved articles. We extracted qualitative data, such as quotes to identify emerging themes. We identified five studies that met our selection criteria. Of them, only one (1/5) was conducted in China while other studies involved Chinese emigrants in USA (3/5) and Singapore (1/5). Participants from China were similar to emigrants with regard to factors that either promoted or decreased research participation. Four studies reported data exclusively on Chinese subjects. Three of the five studies involved qualitative interviews while the others were conducted using a survey design. Six themes favoring research participation were identified: Personal Benefit to Participants, Financial Incentives, Participant Sense of Altruism, Family or Physician Recommendations, Advertisements, and Convenience to the Participant. Five factors were seen as a barrier to participation in clinical trials: Mistrust of Researchers, Language Barrier, Lack of Financial and Other Support, Cultural and Social Barriers, Lack of Knowledge about Clinical Trials. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Chinese heritage clinical research participants value personal benefit, financial incentives, the ability to help others, recommendations of others, advertisements, and convenience when considering clinical research participation. In addition, the establishment of trust and addressing knowledge deficits are important factors to them. Investigators seeking to optimize enrolment in these populations should incorporate these findings into their study design and subject handouts.","Limkakeng, Alexander; Phadtare, Amruta; Shah, Jatin; Vaghasia, Meenakshi; Wei, Ding Ying; Shah, Anand; Pietrobon, Ricardo",PLoS One,655
The cross-cutting contribution of the end of neglected tropical diseases to the sustainable development goals,"The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) call for an integrated response, the kind that has defined Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) efforts in the past decade.NTD interventions have the greatest relevance for SDG3, the health goal, where the focus on equity, and its commitment to reaching people in need of health services, wherever they may live and whatever their circumstances, is fundamentally aligned with the target of Universal Health Coverage. NTD interventions, however, also affect and are affected by many of the other development areas covered under the 2030 Agenda. Strategies such as mass drug administration or the programmatic integration of NTD and WASH activities (SDG6) are driven by effective global partnerships (SDG17). Intervention against the NTDs can also have an impact on poverty (SDG1) and hunger (SDG2), can improve education (SDG4), work and economic growth (SDG8), thereby reducing inequalities (SDG10). The community-led distribution of donated medicines to more than 1 billion people reinforces women's empowerment (SDG5), logistics infrastructure (SDG9) and non-discrimination against disability (SDG16). Interventions to curb mosquito-borne NTDs contribute to the goals of urban sustainability (SDG11) and resilience to climate change (SDG13), while the safe use of insecticides supports the goal of sustainable ecosystems (SDG15). Although indirectly, interventions to control water- and animal-related NTDs can facilitate the goals of small-scale fishing (SDG14) and sustainable hydroelectricity and biofuels (SDG7).NTDs proliferate in less developed areas in countries across the income spectrum, areas where large numbers of people have little or no access to adequate health care, clean water, sanitation, housing, education, transport and information. This scoping review assesses how in this context, ending the epidemic of the NTDs can impact and improve our prospects of attaining the SDGs.","Bangert, Mathieu; Molyneux, David H; Lindsay, Steve W; Fitzpatrick, Christopher; Engels, Dirk",Infect Dis Poverty,656
Some econometric issues in studying nonprofit revenue interactions using NCCS data,"Several econometric issues arise in using nonprofit data. After controlling for unduly influential observations and heteroskedasticity, regression analysis performed on National Center for Charitable Statistics ""digitized data"" from 2001 to 2003 found mixed evidence of economically significant associations between donations and other revenue streams; regressions without these controls support different conclusions. Testing does indicate that government support sends greater quality signals than program support or investment income. © The Author(s) 2011.","Tinkelman, D.; Neely, D.G.",Nonprofit Volunt. Sect.

The Impact of Public Resource Dependence on the Autonomy of NPOs in Their Strategic Decision Making,"Private nonprofit organizations (NPO) involved in publically funded welfare programs face the challenge of maintaining autonomy in their strategic decision-making processes. In this article we study the extent to which NPO managers perceive this autonomy vis-à-vis government in defining the NPO's mission, their working procedures, the target groups to be served and the results to be achieved. Empirical evidence is taken from a large-N sample of 255 NPOs engaged in social welfare provision in Belgium. Our findings suggest that public resource dependence does have a negative impact on the perception of NPOs about the level of organizational autonomy. Still, we will argue that, when looking at the relative share of public income in the NPO's total budget, the nature and intensity of the consultation process between government and NPO and some measures of organizational capacity, this picture is less black and white than presumed. © The Author(s) 2012.","Verschuere, B.; De Corte, J.",Nonprofit Volunt.

Reviewing the evidence on effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of HIV prevention strategies in Thailand,"BACKGROUND: Following universal access to antiretroviral therapy in Thailand, evidence from National AIDS Spending Assessment indicates a decreasing proportion of expenditure on prevention interventions. To prompt policymakers to revitalize HIV prevention, this study identifies a comprehensive list of HIV/AIDs preventive interventions that are likely to be effective and cost-effective in Thailand. METHODS: A systematic review of the national and international literature on HIV prevention strategies from 1997 to 2008 was undertaken. The outcomes used to consider the effectiveness of HIV prevention interventions were changes in HIV risk behaviour and HIV incidence. Economic evaluations that presented their results in terms of cost per HIV infection averted or cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained were also included. All studies were assessed against quality criteria. RESULTS: The findings demonstrated that school based-sex education plus life-skill programs, voluntary and routine HIV counselling and testing, male condoms, street outreach programs, needle and syringe programs, programs for the prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission, male circumcision, screening blood products and donated organs for HIV, and increased alcohol tax were all effective in reducing HIV infection among target populations in a cost-effective manner. CONCLUSION: We found very limited local evidence regarding the effectiveness of HIV interventions amongst specific high risk populations. This underlines the urgent need to prioritise health research resources to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of HIV interventions aimed at reducing HIV infection among high risk groups in Thailand.","Pattanaphesaj, Juntana; Teerawattananon, Yot",BMC Public Health,660
Is Charitable Giving by Nonitemizers Responsive to Tax Incentives? New Evidence,"Was nonitemizer giving responsive to the 1982-6 ""above-the-line"" tax deduction provided for in the 1981 Economic Recovery Tax Act? Here, a Tobit model is applied to Treasury Individual Tax Model file data for 1985 and 1986 to estimate the price elasticity of nonitemizer giving. Nonitemizer giving is found to be price-responsive. The responsiveness is, however, smaller than that for itemizer giving (at least for 1986 when the nonitemizer deduction was fully phased in), suggesting diminishing returns from extending the itemizers-only deduction to nonitemizers. These findings also question whether the nonitemizer deduction can be touted as a highly efficient tax subsidy.","Duquette, C.M.",Natl. Tax J.,661
Health promotion messages: The role of social presence for food choices,"We investigated whether social presence cues encourage consumers to self-regulate and select healthier food products. In the first experiment, workers completed food choices in an e-commerce environment. After the activation of health-related goals, they saw a social presence cue and were asked to choose between healthy and unhealthy food options. The analyses revealed main effects of social presence and health goal activation on food choices. These effects were additive, such that the combination of social presence and health goals induced significantly healthier choices compared with the control group. The second experiment further examined social presence cues that were presented on a menu. The results showed significant effects on food choices and on the perceived self-regulatory success in dieting. These findings indicate that social presence cues could be employed to increase healthful eating and, furthermore, that it may be useful to co-activate multiple cues in health promotion messages. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Bittner, J.V.; Kulesz, M.M.",Appetite,662
Research on entrepreneurial orientation: current status and future agenda,"Purpose – Research on entrepreneurial orientation (EO) has attracted researchers’ attention for over 30 years. The purpose of this paper is to comprehensively analyze the body of literature resulting from 30 years of research in EO, and to answer the following questions: what are the major themes that have emerged? What areas are missing? What degree of convergence do we see in the field of EO, and what concepts/topics has the field converged around? Design/methodology/approach – A bibliometric study with a sample of 405 articles published from January 1987 to July 2014 was developed. Techniques of bibliometric, lexical, and content analysis were used. The analysis involved: the evolution of published articles; the main authors, their nationalities, and institutional affiliations; citation and co-citations analysis; the journals that have published the most articles; and the most frequently-searched topics. Opting for bibliometric techniques permit an analysis of a larger number of articles and a greater variety of articles than other methodologies such as meta-analyses and systematic review studies. Accordingly, a more comprehensive look at the field of EO can be taken. Findings – Two distinct but complementary classifications are proposed to characterize the body of the literature resulting from 30 years of research in EO. The first one demonstrates that the field presents a convergence of the themes in four axis which together comprise studies on EO: performance, strategy, entrepreneurial attitude, and management. The second one presents the frequency of occurrence of the themes in the field: high-frequency themes or classical themes, frequently in the literature; moderate-frequency themes or emerging issues have not been sufficiently explored; low-frequency themes or potential opportunities related to understudied issues and contexts less frequently surveyed. A future research agenda is proposed for emerging themes and specific contexts. Practical implications – The identification of key themes in the field of EO contributes to assess the research evolution in order to recognize emerging themes and contexts, and the research gaps. With this, it is possible to lead new studies to cover a lack of research and advance knowledge in the field. The themes most studied also show the contribution for EO to organizational practice, especially in relation to the impact on the performance, the stimulus to the development of innovations, and the effects on organizational growth. Additionally, the identification of the authors most cited, most productive on the theme and the identification of the core journals for publishing of the area is recommended as a general reference for researchers interested in the topic of EO. Social implications – Although EO literature has been widely developed in Anglo regions (especially in the USA and UK) and Germanic Europe (especially Spain), there are others lacking these studies, especially Latin America, sub-Saharan Africa, Eastern Europe, and Middle East, with rare articles published internationally. The results can guide the advancement of research in these different contexts and realities where even issues more widely treated in the literature have been unexplored. The lack of studies in certain contexts can lead to new studies for inserting new insights into EO, such as potential differences between developed regions and in development. For regions where the studies on EO are more developed, the results of this paper contribute to signaling issues and contexts little explored that may be the focus of attention. Originality/value – The generation of literature indicators of EO through bibliometric fills a research gap on the theme, providing a more comprehensive view of the field and of the current status of the research on EO. Identifying the most frequent topics in EO literature, and little-explored themes and contexts makes it possible to propose an agenda for future research and knowledge generation on EO. Thus, it is suggested the development of studies focus on emerging themes like growth, learning, knowledge, resources, and capabilities; also in specific contexts with potential for aggregating new knowledges in the EO field such as family firms, non-profit organizations, social contexts, the public sector, university, spin-off, firms in emerging and developing economies. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Martens, Cristina Dai Prá; Lacerda, Fabrício Martins; Belfort, Ana Claudia; Freitas, Henrique Mello Rodrigues de",International Journal of Entrepreneurial Behaviour and Research,663
Please Help A Preliminary Study on the Effect of Social Proof and Legitimization of Paltry Contributions in Donations to OSS,"Open source communities have contributed widely to modern software development. The number of open source software (OSS) has increased rapidly in the past two decades. Most open source foundations (such as Eclipse, Mozilla and Apache) operate as non-profit; those foundations usually seek donations from users/developers to financially support their activities. Without such support, some projects might discontinue to develop, or even disappear. However, contributions to those foundations are usually solicited in a very simple and modest way, with no special promotions or attractions for such contributions. The aim of this study is to promote new strategies that can help to increase donations to OSS projects. We analyzed how existing donation pages are structured. We then introduce behavioral economics and psychological theories that have been used in other disciplines to promote donations in OSS. In particular, we used the social proof theory, i.e., where people tend to consider the actions of others in an attempt to reflect correct behavior when they choose their own actions, and legitimization of paltry contributions strategy i.e., using specific phrases such as 'even a very small amount will help' to encourage donations. In this study, we conducted an experiment with University students to examine if those theories are effective in encouraging donations to OSS. Our initial results indicate that the two strategies were indeed effective in promoting donations, and showed that users were more open for donation compared to traditional methods. This is only a preliminary analysis-we aim to include more users in the future for a more comprehensive analysis. We anticipate that such techniques might help OSS projects to secure more donations in the future. © 2019 IEEE.","Yukizawa, U.; Tsunoda, M.; Tahir, A.","SANER - Proc. IEEE Int. Conf. Softw.

"When the victim is one among others: Empathy, awareness of others and motivational ambivalence","Feeling empathy for one person in need while being aware of others may increase the motivational ambivalence between the motive of helping the one and the motive of helping the others, and such motivational ambivalence may reduce the helping directed to the person in need. To test these hypotheses we carried out three studies in which participants were faced with a real case of a child in need. In Study 1, empathy, awareness of others and motivational ambivalence were allowed to occur naturally and subsequently measured. In Study 2, empathy and awareness of others were experimentally manipulated, and motivational ambivalence measured. In Study 3, we tested how empathy and motivational ambivalence influenced an actual helping decision. Taken together, the results supported our two hypotheses. The present research offers insight into processes not previously considered in the research, but which may influence decisions about assistance to others in need. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Oceja, L.; Ambrona, T.; López-Pérez, B.; Salgado, S.; Villegas, M.",Motiv.

SPSS and SAS procedures for estimating indirect effects in simple mediation models,"Researchers often conduct mediation analysis in order to indirectly assess the effect of a proposed cause on some outcome through a proposed mediator. The utility of mediation analysis stems from its ability to go beyond the merely descriptive to a more functional understanding of the relationships among variables. A necessary component of mediation is a statistically and practically significant indirect effect. Although mediation hypotheses are frequently explored in psychological research, formal significance tests of indirect effects are rarely conducted. After a brief overview of mediation, we argue the importance of directly testing the significance of indirect effects and provide SPSS and SAS macros that facilitate estimation of the indirect effect with a normal theory approach and a bootstrap approach to obtaining confidence intervals, as well as the traditional approach advocated by Baron and Kenny (1986). We hope that this discussion and the macros will enhance the frequency of formal mediation tests in the psychology literature.

Watchful eyes: Implicit observability cues and voting,"Explicit social pressure has been shown to be a powerful motivator of prosocial behavior like voting in elections. In this study, I replicate and extend the findings of a randomized field experiment designed to study the impact of more subtle, implicit social pressure treatments on voting. The results of the original experiment, conducted in the October 2011 municipal elections in Key West, Florida, demonstrated that even subtle, implicit observability cues, like a pair of stylized eyes facing subjects, effectively mobilized citizens to vote, by about as much as explicit surveillance cues. The replication study, conducted in Lexington, KY, during the November 2011 gubernatorial election, corroborates these findings and suggests that eyes effect on average does not likely depend on the gender of eyespots used. Taken together, the two field experiments provide strong support for the notion studies that humans are evolutionarily programmed to respond to certain stimuli and that exposure to images that implicitly signal observability is sufficient to stimulate prosocial behavior. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Panagopoulos, C.",Evol.

Fooling the Nice Guys: Explaining receiver credulity in a public good game with lying and punishment,"We demonstrate that receiver credulity can be understood through a false consensus effect: the likelihood with which individuals believe messages about the behavior of others can be explained by their own behavioral tendencies in a comparable situation. In a laboratory experiment, subjects play a public good game with punishment in which feedback on actual contributions is obscured. Instead, subjects communicate what they have contributed through a post hoc announcement mechanism. Using subjects' social value orientation as a proxy for their contribution tendency, we show that those high on the measure have inflated beliefs about the contribution of others. This, in turn, impacts their contribution and punishment decisions. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Irlenbusch, B.; Ter Meer, J.",J. Econ. Behav. Organ.,673
Comparing spousal agreement on perceived responsibility for household natural hazard preparedness to actual behavior,"This study compares husbands' and wives' views on the person in a couple who should be responsible for preparing for hurricane hazards; it also examines whether the varying levels of agreement reached by husbands and wives regarding this responsibility are associated with actual preparedness behaviors. An online survey targeting married, heterosexual couples living in Sarasota County, Florida, USA was sent out between March and May, 2015. Both the husbands and the wives were asked to fill out the survey. A total of 170 surveys were used for analysis. Results suggested that husbands and wives felt that they had shared responsibility for most of the 19 preparedness behaviors considered. However, a few stereotypically masculine preparedness behaviors were found to typically fall to husbands. Husbands' and wives' views of perceived responsibility were not statistically different, but husbands tended to favor individual responsibility, while wives tended to favor joint responsibility. Higher levels of agreement were significantly associated with greater engagement in planning-related preparedness behaviors. Policy implications are discussed. © 2019 Li-San Hung.

Pharmacologic Therapies for the Management of Crohn's Disease: Comparative Effectiveness,"OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this review was to compare the efficacy and safety of biologics, immunomodulators, corticosteroids, and aminosalicylates in the treatment of Crohn's disease. DATA SOURCES: We searched MEDLINE® (1966 through June 2011), Embase® (1974 through June 2011), and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Issue 2, 2011). REVIEW METHODS: Two reviewers independently reviewed titles, abstracts, and articles, and included English-language articles that reported on induction or maintenance of remission in placebo-controlled or head-to-head randomized controlled trials. We also included observational studies with a comparison group if they reported on the safety of treatment. Two reviewers extracted study information using standardized forms and independently assessed study quality. Efficacy was measured by induction and maintenance of remission. Remission was defined using the Crohn's Disease Activity Index, mucosal healing, the absence of Crohn's disease hospitalizations or surgeries, reduction of steroids, fistula healing, and patient-reported outcomes. A difference of 10 percentage points in the outcome between treatment groups was considered clinically meaningful. The safety outcomes of interest were mortality, occurrence of lymphomas and other cancers, infections, infusion- and injection-site reactions, and bone fractures for adults and children. Growth was an additional safety concern for children. RESULTS: We included 136 studies involving 148,733 patients. Twenty-three percent of trials directly compared different treatment strategies. The majority of trials excluded patients with mild disease and those with a history of surgical resection. The majority of trials allowed patients to take other Crohn's disease treatments during the trial. For adults, infliximab and 6-methyl-prednisolone were consistently favored over placebo across the induction and maintenance outcomes. Natalizumab and azathioprine were favored over placebo across the maintenance outcomes. Other comparisons either did not have more than one outcome reported or had inconsistent results. The quality of the safety evidence was poor due to poor reporting of the methods in trials and poor confounding control in observational studies, and no strong signals of harm were identified. For children, the strength of evidence was low or insufficient to support the efficacy of any medication to induce or maintain remission. No pediatric study reported on serious adverse events such as mortality, lymphoma, or other cancers. CONCLUSIONS: Measuring the efficacy of medications using multiple outcomes, infliximab and 6-methyl-prednisolone induce and maintain remission in adults with Crohn's disease. Natalizumab and azathioprine maintain remission. Comparing Crohn's disease medications directly using pragmatic clinical trials will help to understand the effectiveness of medications in clinical practice using outcomes other than the Crohn's Disease Activity Index.","Hutfless, Susan; Almashat, Sammy; Berger, Zackary; Wilson, Lisa M; Bonson, Elizabeth; Chen, Qi; Donath, Elie; Herlong, Frank; Puhan, Milo A; Selvaraj, Saranya; Tuskey, Anne; Vasilescu, Alexandra; Bass, Eric B; Worthington, Mark; Shantha, Ghanshyam Palamaner Subash; Lazarev, Mark",,675
"Are luxury brand labels and ""green"" labels costly signals of social status? An extended replication","Costly signaling theory provides an explanation for why humans are willing to a pay a premium for conspicuous products such as luxury brand-labeled clothing or conspicuous environmentally friendly cars. According to the theory, the extra cost of such products is a signal of social status and wealth and leads to advantages in social interactions for the signaler. A previous study found positive evidence for the case of luxury brand labels. However, an issue of this study was that some of the experiments were not conducted in a perfectly double-blind manner. I resolved this by replicating variations of the original design in a double-blind procedure. Additionally, besides the luxury label condition, I introduced a ""green"" label condition. Thus, the hypothesis that signaling theory is able to explain pro-environmental behavior was tested for the first time in a natural field setting. Further, I conducted experiments in both average and below-average socioeconomic neighborhoods, where, according to signaling theory, the effects of luxury signals should be even stronger. In contrast to the original study, I did not find positive effects of the luxury brand label in any of the five experiments. Nor did I find evidence for a green-signaling effect. Moreover, in poor neighborhoods a negative tendency of the luxury label actually became evident. This suggests that a signaling theory explanation of costly labels must take into account the characteristics of the observers, e.g. their social status. © 2017 Joël Berger.

Facial electromyography reveals dissociable affective responses in social and non-social cooperation,"While economic standard theory explains cooperation in terms of rational decision-making, empirical studies suggest that humans have social preferences for cooperating with others. We investigated the specificity of these social preferences for interactions with human, relative to non-human, agents in a prisoner’s dilemma game. To obtain insights into emotional processes during cooperation, we measured activity of the corrugator supercilii muscle as indicator of spontaneous emotional responding during cooperation. After unreciprocated defection (free-riding), participants switched more often to a cooperative strategy and showed increased corrugator activity (suggesting more negative emotional responses) when playing with a human relative to a computer. This suggests that humans have a specific preference for cooperating with other humans and that cooperation may be promoted by unpleasant affect in response to the outcome of one’s own “free-riding”. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Soutschek, A.; Weinreich, A.; Schubert, T.",Motiv.

On aims and methods of Ethology,"Ich habe in diesem Aufsatz kurz anzudeuten versucht, was meiner Ansicht nach das Wesentliche in Fragestellung und Methode der Ethologie ist und weshalb wir in Konrad Lorenz den Begründer moderner Ethologie erblicken. Hierbei habe ich vielleicht das Arbeitsgebiet der Ethologie weiter gefaßt, als unter Ethologen gebräuchlich ist. Wenn man aber die vielartige Arbeit jener Forscher übersieht, die sich Ethologen nennen, ist man zu dieser weiten Fassung geradezu gezwungen. Ich habe in meiner Darstellung weder Vollständigkeit noch Gleichgewicht angestrebt und, um zur Fortführung des Gesprächs anzuregen, ruhig meine Steckenpferde geritten, vor allem das Verhältnis zwischen Ethologie und Physiologie, die Gefahr der Vernachlässigung der Frage der Arterhaltung, Fragen der Methodik der ontogenetischen Forschung, und Aufgaben und Methoden der Evolutionsforschung. Bei der Einschätzung des Anteils, den Lorenz an der Entwicklung der Ethologie genommen hat und noch nimmt, habe ich als seinen Hauptbeitrag den bezeichnet, daß er uns gezeigt hat, wie man bewährtes “biologisches Denken” folgerichtig auf Verhalten anwenden kann. Daß er dabei an die Arbeit seiner Vorgänger angeknüpft hat, ist nicht mehr verwunderlich, als daß jeder Vater selbst einen Vater hat. Insbesondere scheint mir das Wesentliche an Lorenz‘ Arbeit zu sein, daß er klar gesehen hat, daß Verhaltensweisen Teile von “Organen”, von Systemen der Arterhaltung sind; daß ihre Verursachung genau so exakt untersucht werden kann wie die gleich welcher anderer Lebensvorgänge, daß ihr arterhaltender Wert ebenso systematisch und exakt aufweisbar ist wie ihre Verursachung, daß Verhaltensontogenie in grundsätzlich gleicher Weise erforscht werden kann wie die Ontogenie der Form und daß die Erforschung der Verhaltensevolution der Untersuchung der Strukturevolution parallel geht. Und obwohl Lorenz ein riesiges Tatsachenmaterial gesammelt hat, ist die Ethologie doch noch mehr durch seine Fragestellung und durch kühne Hypothesen gefördert als durch eigene Nachprüfung dieser Hypothesen. Ohne den Wert solcher Nachprüfung zu unterschätzen — ohne die es natürlich keine Weiterentwicklung gäbe — möchte ich doch behaupten, daß die durch Nachprüfung notwendig gewordenen Modifikationen neben der Leistung des ursprünglichen Ansatzes vergleichsweise unbedeutend sind. Nebenbei sei auch daran erinnert, daß eine der vielen heilsamen Nachwirkungen der Lorenzschen Arbeit das wachsende Interesse ist, das die Humanpsychologie der Ethologie entgegenbringt ‐ ein erster Ansatz einer Entwicklung, deren Tragweite wir noch kaum übersehen können. Am Schluß noch eine Bemerkung zur Terminologie. Ich habe hier das Wort “Ethologie” auf einen Riesenkomplex von Wissenschaften angewandt, von denen manche, wie Psychologie und Physiologie, schon längst anerkannte Namen tragen. Das heißt natürlich nicht, daß ich den Namen Ethologie für dieses ganze Gebiet vorschlagen will; das wäre geschichtlich einfach falsch, weil das Wort historisch nur die Arbeit einer kleinen Gruppe von Zoologen kennzeichnet. Der Name ist natürlich gleichgültig; worauf es mir vor allem ankommt, ist darzutun, daß wir das Zusammenwachsen vieler Einzeldisziplinen zu einer vielumfassenden Wissenschaft erleben, für die es nur einen richtigen Namen gibt: “Verhaltensbiologie”. Selbstverständlich ist diese synthetische Entwicklung nicht die Arbeit eines Mannes oder gar die der Ethologen. Sie ist die Folge einer allgemeinen Neigung, Brücken zwischen verwandten Wissenschaften zu schlagen, einer Neigung, die sich in vielen Disziplinen entwickelt hat. Unter den Zoologen ist es Lorenz, der hierzu am meisten beigetragen und zudem manche Nachbardisziplinen stärker beeinflußt hat als irgendein anderer. Ich bin sogar davon überzeugt, daß diese Einwirkungen auf Nachbarwissenschaften noch lange anhalten werden und daß die Verhaltensbiologie erst am Anfang ihrer Ontogenie steht. 1963 Blackwell Verlag GmbH","Tinbergen, N.",Ethology,679

"Violent Lyrics = Aggressive Listeners?: Effects of song lyrics and tempo on cognition, affect, and self-reported arousal","Research on music has had an impressive impact. For example, the semantic content of lyrics seems to cause associated short-Term effects regarding cognition and affect. However, we argue that these effects might have been confounded by other musical parameters related to time, pitch, texture, or voice of the selected songs. This study overcame this methodological problem by using different versions of an experimentally manipulated song. In a 2 × 2 between-subjects design, 120 university students listened to four versions of a song with violent or prosocial lyrics presented in slow or fast tempo. As predicted by theories of priming, violent lyrics increased aggressive cognitions (word completion test) and aggressive affect (self-reported state anger) in comparison with prosocial lyrics. However, the reverse effects of prosocial lyrics on prosocial cognitions and prosocial affect could not be confirmed. Finally, the tempo of the song did not consistently increase selfreported arousal, and we did not find more extreme effects under conditions of fast tempo as predicted by the arousal-extremity model. © 2015 Hogrefe Publishing.","Pieschl, S.; Fegers, S.",J.

Participants' Understanding of Informed Consent for Biobanking: A Systematic Review,"Nurses are increasingly asked to obtain consent from participants for biobanking studies. Biobanking has added unique complexities to informed consent. The purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate participants' level of understanding of the information presented during the informed consent process unique to the donation of biological specimens for research. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were utilized to conduct the review. PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Scopus, Web of Science, and ProQuest bibliographic databases were searched. Results indicated that elements of informed consent unique to biobanking were poorly understood. Most studies had authors or funding associated with a biobank. Only one study disclosed and assessed participants' understanding of moral risks. Increased disclosures, values-clarification, and presenting information via multiple modalities may facilitate understanding. There is a need to improve the quality of informed consent for biobanking studies by utilizing standardized instruments, definitions, and encouraging research about informed choice outside the biobanking industry.","Eisenhauer, Elizabeth R; Tait, Alan R; Rieh, Soo Young; Arslanian-Engoren, Cynthia M",Clin.

Increasing compliance by legitimizing paltry contributions: When even a penny helps,"Two experiments were conducted in a door-to-door charity drive context with 165 Ss to examine the effectiveness of a technique for solving the dilemma of small requests. In this predicament it has been observed that minimal requests, while serving to make a target person's compliance highly likely, also tend to produce low-level payoffs for the requester. A procedure was developed to avoid the dilemma by legitimizing, rather than requesting, the delivery of a minimal favor. It was predicted that a solicitor who implied that a very small favor was acceptable, but not necessarily desirable, would make it difficult for a target to decline to help and, at the same time, make it unlikely that the target would actually offer a low grade of assistance. In confirmation of this prediction, a door-to-door solicitor for charity was able to increase significantly the frequency of donations while leaving unaffected the size of the donations by adding the sentence, ""Even a penny will help,"" to a standard request for funds. Exp II replicated this result and provided evidence for the legitimization-of-small-favors explanation of the effect.

Helping when the desire is low: Expectancy as a booster,"One might assume that the desire to help (here described as Want) is the essential driver of helping declarations and/or behaviors. However, even if desire to help (Want) is low, intention to help may still occur if the expectancy regarding the perceived effectiveness of helping is high. We tested these predictions in a set of three experimental studies. In all three, we measured the desire to help (Want) and the Expectancy that the aid would be impactful for the victim; in addition, we manipulated Expectancy in Study 3. In Studies 1 and 3, we measured the participants’ declaration to help while in Study 2, their helping behavior was examined. In all three studies, we used variations of the same story about a victim. The results supported our hypothesis. Thus, the studies help to tease apart the determinants of helping under conditions of lowered desire to do so, an issue of great importance in public policymaking. © 2020, The Author(s).","Kossowska, M.; Szumowska, E.; Szwed, P.; Czernatowicz-Kukuczka, A.; Kruglanski, A.W.",Motiv.

Seeing Their Side Versus Feeling Their Pain: Differential Consequences of Perspective-Taking and Empathy at Work,"Perspective taking and empathic concern (empathy) have each been proposed as constructive approaches to social relationships. However, their potential distinctions, limitations, and consequences in task contexts are not well understood. We meta-analytically examined 304 independent samples to uncover unique effects of perspective taking and empathic concern on important work-related outcomes. We develop and test a contingency model of those effects, based on three facets of psychological interdependence: outcome, hierarchical (or power asymmetry), and social category (or in-group/out-group distinctions). Results revealed perspective taking and empathic concern to have positive impacts on being supportive of others, but the effects of empathic concern were stionger. In contrast, perspective taking was an asset and empathy was a liability for capturing value in strategic interactions (e.g., negotiations). Effects of perspective taking and empathic concern were differentially contingent on psychological interdependence. The impact of perspective taking, but not of empathic concern, was attenuated or reversed under negative outcome interdependence; perspective-taking leads to advantage taking in competitive contexts. Perspective taking was particularly beneficial when the actor had high power, but empathic concern's benefits were independent of hierarchy. Finally, social dissimilarity had no detectable impact on the effects of perspective taking or empathic concern, contrary to our theorizing. Overall results suggest two key conclusions. First, perspective taking and empathic concern have powerful effects on work-relaled outcomes. Second, each construct has its own distinctive and predictable impacts. We conclude by offering practical suggestions for improving workplace interactions through perspective taking and empathic concern.","Longmire, Natalie H; Harrison, David A",J. Appl. Psychol.,689
Revisiting generosity in the dictator game: Experimental evidence from Pakistan,"This paper revisits the influence of unearned money, anonymity of the decisions and religiosity on generosity in the dictator game with charity as a recipient. The results of the experiments performed in Pakistan show that women are significantly less generous when donating with earned as compared to unearned money while men are equally generous with both unearned and earned money. The anonymity of the decisions does not significantly influence the behavior of both men and women. Moreover, women are more generous than men only when the decisions are exercised with unearned money, with earned money there are no significant gender differences in generosity. Interestingly donating all income is the modal choice in all the treatments and average donations are more than 50% of the income. Lastly subjects with higher religiosity donate significantly more than those with lower religiosity and their donations are primarily driven by the religious teachings as well. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Umer, H.",J.

"Amazon's mechanical Turk: A new source of inexpensive, yet high-quality, data?","Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk) is a relatively new website that contains the major elements required to conduct research: an integrated participant compensation system; a large participant pool; and a streamlined process of study design, participant recruitment, and data collection. In this article, we describe and evaluate the potential contributions of MTurk to psychology and other social sciences. Findings indicate that (a) MTurk participants are slightly more demographically diverse than are standard Internet samples and are significantly more diverse than typical American college samples; (b) participation is affected by compensation rate and task length, but participants can still be recruited rapidly and inexpensively; (c) realistic compensation rates do not affect data quality; and (d) the data obtained are at least as reliable as those obtained via traditional methods. Overall, MTurk can be used to obtain high-quality data inexpensively and rapidly. © The Author(s) 2011.","Buhrmester, M.; Kwang, T.; Gosling, S.D.",Perspect. Psychol. Sci.,691

Commercialization of kidney transplants: a systematic review of outcomes in recipients and donors,"The majority of the studies showed inferior patient and graft outcomes for commercial kidney transplant recipients. There was a higher incidence of unconventional and life-threatening infections, and an increased incidence of postoperative surgical interventions, in commercial recipients. XCM: The inclusion criteria were broadly defined in terms of intervention, but not explicitly defined in terms of participants, outcomes or study design. Several relevant sources were searched, but search dates were not reported. It was unclear whether any efforts were made to reduce publication or language bias. Methods used to select studies or extract data were not reported, so it was unclear whether attempts were made to reduce reviewer error and bias. Validity was not assessed, so results from these studies and any synthesis may not be reliable. In addition, the authors did not report the study designs of the included studies. A narrative synthesis was appropriate given the differences between studies. The authors' conclusions reflected the data presented, but the potential for bias in the review means their reliability is unclear. XIM: Practice: The authors stated that a database of patients in Western countries who have obtained their kidneys through commercial transactions should be established to allow identification of centres where kidneys have been obtained and help identify surgical, medical and immunosuppressive protocols for recipients and donors. Liaison between recipient and donor hospitals is also required to enable modern surgical and medical practices to be implemented. Improved emotional and psychological support should be provided to both recipient and donor.Research: The authors did not state any implications for research.","Sajjad, I; Baines, L S; Patel, P; Salifu, M O; Jindal, R M",,693
The efficient interaction of indirect reciprocity and costly punishment,"Human cooperation in social dilemmas challenges researchers from various disciplines. Here we combine advances in experimental economics and evolutionary biology that separately have shown that costly punishment and reputation formation, respectively, induce cooperation in social dilemmas. The mechanisms of punishment and reputation, however, substantially differ in their means for 'disciplining' non-cooperators. Direct punishment incurs salient costs for both the punisher and the punished, whereas reputation mechanisms discipline by withholding action, immediately saving costs for the 'punisher'. Consequently, costly punishment may become extinct in environments in which effective reputation building - for example, through indirect reciprocity - provides a cheaper and powerful way to sustain cooperation. Unexpectedly, as we show here, punishment is maintained when a combination with reputation building is available, however, at a low level. Costly punishment acts are markedly reduced although not simply substituted by appreciating reputation. Indeed, the remaining punishment acts are concentrated on free-riders, who are most severely punished in the combination. When given a choice, subjects even prefer a combination of reputation building with costly punishment. The interaction between punishment and reputation building boosts cooperative efficiency. Because punishment and reputation building are omnipresent interacting forces in human societies, costly punishing should appear less destructive without losing its deterring force. ©2006 Nature Publishing Group.","Rockenbach, B.; Milinski, M.",Nature,694

Research Consent Models Used in Prospective Studies of Neurologically Deceased Organ Donors: A Systematic Review,"Research to inform the care of neurologically deceased organ donors is complicated by a lack of standards for research consent. In this systematic review, we aim to describe current practices of soliciting consent for participation in prospective studies of neurologically deceased donors, including the frequency and justification for these various models of consent. Among the 74 studies included, 14 did not report on any regulatory review, and 13 did not report on the study consent procedures. Of the remaining 47 studies, 24 utilized a waiver of research consent. The most common justification for a waiver of research consent related to the fact that neurologically deceased donors are not considered human subjects. In conclusion, among studies of neurologically deceased donors, research consent models vary and are inconsistently reported. Consensus and standardization in the application of research consent models will help to advance this emerging field of research. © The Author(s) 2020.","D’Aragon, F.; Burns, K.E.A.; Yaworski, A.; Lucas, A.; Arseneau, E.; Belley-Cote, E.; Dhanani, S.; Frenette, A.-J.; Lamontagne, F.; Lauzier, F.; Akhtar, A.; Oczkowski, S.; Rochwerg, B.; Meade, M.O.",J.

"Private voluntary organizations engaged in international assistance, 1939-2004","U.S.-based private and voluntary organizations (PVOs) play an important role in international assistance. To assess this role, the authors constructed a new data set that covers more than 1,600 secular and religious PVOs that registered with the U.S. federal government between 1939 and 2004. In the post-World War II period, major revenue patterns are the rise of Evangelical PVOs, decline of Jewish PVOs, and rapid growth of secular PVOs from the mid-1980s to mid-1990s. The authors analyze the determinants of changes in PVO size, gauged by real revenue. They focus on the interplay between public revenue (from the federal government, international organizations, and other governments) and private revenue. Specifically, they investigate whether funds from the federal government and other public entities serve as a magnet for subsequent private support. © 2008 Association for Research on Nonprofit Organizations and Voluntary Action.","McCleary, R.M.; Barro, R.J.",Nonprofit Volunt.

Biased sequential sampling underlies the effects of time pressure and delay in social decision making,"Social decision making involves balancing conflicts between selfishness and pro-sociality. The cognitive processes underlying such decisions are not well understood, with some arguing for a single comparison process, while others argue for dual processes (one intuitive and one deliberative). Here, we propose a way to reconcile these two opposing frameworks. We argue that behavior attributed to intuition can instead be seen as a starting point bias of a sequential sampling model (SSM) process, analogous to a prior in a Bayesian framework. Using mini-dictator games in which subjects make binary decisions about how to allocate money between themselves and another participant, we find that pro-social subjects become more pro-social under time pressure and less pro-social under time delay, while selfish subjects do the opposite. Our findings help reconcile the conflicting results concerning the cognitive processes of social decision making and highlight the importance of modeling the dynamics of the choice process. © 2018, The Author(s).","Chen, F.; Krajbich, I.",Nat.

On the redistribution of wealth in a developing country: Experimental evidence on stake and framing effects,"We experimentally study the effect of framing and size of large windfall gains on the redistribution of such gains. Randomly selected individuals from villages in Bangladesh were invited to take part in dictator experiments where they received endowments worth up to five months of average household income and were asked to distribute the endowment between themselves and other individuals. We manipulated whether dictators could GIVE to or TAKE from another individual (i.e. whether the endowment was allocated to the dictator or other individual) and whether the endowment was moderate (LOW) or very large (HIGH). We also provided dictators with the option to reconsider their original decision. We find that dictators allocate almost nine times more to other individuals under the TAKE than the GIVE frame when stakes are HIGH, even after they could reconsider their choices. In addition, we find that proportions allocated to other individuals dramatically drop when stakes increase under the GIVE but not the TAKE frame. The results provide novel evidence on the role of framing and stakes for pro-sociality. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Leibbrandt, A.; Maitra, P.; Neelim, A.",J. Econ. Behav. Organ.,700
Gazing at me: The importance of social meaning in understanding direct-gaze cues,"Direct gaze is an engaging and important social cue, but the meaning of direct gaze depends heavily on the surrounding context. This paper reviews some recent studies of direct gaze, to understand more about what neural and cognitive systems are engaged by this social cue and why. The data show that gaze can act as an arousal cue and can modulate actions, and can activate brain regions linked to theory of mind and self-related processing. However, all these results are strongly modulated by the social meaning of a gaze cue and by whether participants believe that another person is really watching them. The implications of these contextual effects and audience effects for our theories of gaze are considered. © 2015 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Empathy Avoidance: Forestalling Feeling for Another in Order to Escape the Motivational Consequences,"Often people fail to respond to those in need. Why? In addition to cognitive and perceptual processes such as oversight and diffusion of responsibility, a motivational process may lead people, at times, to actively avoid feeling empathy for those in need, lest they be motivated to help them. It is predicted that empathy avoidance will occur when, before exposure to a person in need, people are aware that (a) they will be asked to help this person and (b) helping will be costly. To test this prediction, Ss were given the choice of hearing 1 of 2 versions of an appeal by a homeless man for help: an empathy-inducing version or a non-empathy-inducing version. As predicted, those aware that they soon would be given a high-cost opportunity to help the man chose to hear the empathy-inducing version less often than did those either unaware of the upcoming opportunity or aware but led to believe that helping involved low cost.","Shaw, L.L.; Batson, C.D.; Todd, R.M.",J.

Pareto optimal redistribution and private charity,"When private charity exists and is motivated by utility interdependence a non-Pareto optimal outcome, the 'free-rider' problem, typically arises. Nevertheless, incremental fiscal redistribution cannot achieve a Paretian welfare improvement so long as private charity continues at positive levels. Donors respond to incremental fiscal redistribution by reducing their voluntary contributions by exactly a dollar for every dollar transferred in this way. No net transfer is achieved unless incremental fiscal redistribution is pursued to the point where private contributions have been driven to zero. Alternatively, a net transfer may be achieved by fiscal measures which affect donors' marginal incentives to donate. © 1982.","Warr, P.G.",J. Public Econ.,705
Social participation and employment status after kidney transplantation: a systematic review,"Most studies reported employment status, but there was a paucity of evidence for other aspects of social participation. The quality and validity of the studies precluded definitive conclusions. XCM: The research question was clear and inclusion criteria were specified for participants, intervention, outcome and study design. The authors searched six appropriate electronic databases and other appropriate sources. Only English-language reports were sought and the authors' did not report any attempt to identify unpublished studies, which increased the possibility of language and publication bias. Study selection and validity assessment was conducted independently by two reviewers, minimising the risk of errors and bias in the review process, however, the authors did not state how the data were extracted. Validity of the included studies was assessed and the studies were combined in a narrative synthesis, which was appropriate considering the heterogeneity between studies (for example, the differences in defining categories of employment). The primary studies were generally of poor quality and this was highlighted by the authors. The authors' took the limitations in the research methodology and quality of the primary studies into consideration and their conclusions are likely to be reliable. XIM: Practice: The authors did not state any implications for practiceResearch: The authors stated that future studies should fulfill methodological criteria as listed in the quality assessment checklist reported in the review. It was also important for researchers to identify potential prognostic demographic, personal and transplant-related factors and to use multivariate regression analysis to adjust for confounding variables to improve identification of patients at risk for decreased social participation after kidney transplantation. There was also a need for clear definitions of aspects of social participation for comparative purposes.","van der Mei S, F; Krol, B; van Son W, J; De Jong P, E; Groothoff, J W; van den Heuvel W, J",,706
Private versus public charity: Reassessing crowding out from the supply side,"This paper tests a model where government and private charity are perfect substitutes in consumption, but the cost of providing charitable assistance differs between private and government suppliers. The analysis demonstrates that higher costs of transferring through the government can account for the observed phenomenon of less than complete crowding out and the empirical results are broadly consistent with that approach. Overall the evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that individuals both care about the leakages involved in transferring funds to the poor through government and respond in their private giving to changes in the differential public cost.","Ferris, J.S.; West, E.G.",Public Choice,707
"The Influences of Eye-Gaze, Style of Dress, and Locality on the Amounts of Money Donated to a Charity","A number of studies have examined in the laboratory the effects of an individual's eye-gaze upon the behavior of another. In this study the effects of gaze were investigated in a real-life setting in which a collector of money for a charity either looked a possible donor in the eye when asking for money or looked at the collecting tin. Significantly more money was donated in the former condition. While neither the style of dress of the collector nor the locality in which the collections were made had an overall effect, significant interactive effects were noted for gaze and style of dress, for style of dress and locality, and for gaze and locality. Gaze was a more potent factor when the collector was dressed casually than smartly, and when the collections were made in high-rise flats as opposed to terraced houses. © 1981, Sage Publications.

Do Donors Penalize Nonprofit Organizations with Accumulated Wealth?,"Does current accumulated wealth by nonprofit organizations influence contributions from individuals? Existing research demonstrates that financial reserves aid program continuity during economic downturns. Yet donors, charity watchdogs, and policy makers voice concern about accumulated wealth in nonprofits. This empirical analysis examines whether the expected negative relationship occurs when donors perceive accumulated wealth as excessive. The results support the conclusion that future contributions are negatively affected when wealth levels are deemed excessive. Nonprofit managers concerned that accumulated wealth will diminish donations should consider financial strategies that will allow their organizations to build modest-but not excessive-reserves. © 2011 The American Society for Public Administration.","Calabrese, T.D.",Public Adm.

On the behavioural relevance of optional and mandatory impure public goods,"Impure public goods combine a private good with a public good. Often, impure public goods have a charitable or ethical dimension, giving ethically motivated consumers a convenient option to contribute to public goods through the marketplace (in addition to direct donations). Impure public goods could potentially promote ethical giving or alternatively hinder charitable behaviour. We implement an economics experiment with a between-subject design to test the behavioural relevance of impure public goods with only a token (i.e. small) contribution to a public good. Contributions to the public good are negatively affected by the presence of impure public goods with token contributions. We explore one mechanism to offset this negative impact by making the token impure public good mandatory. We observe higher average contributions and several positive impacts on charitable behaviour, which supports the claim that this mechanism can potentially offset the negative impact of impure public goods. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Engelmann, D.; Munro, A.; Valente, M.",J.

The evil eye: Eye gaze and competitiveness in social decision making,"We demonstrate that a person's eye gaze and his/her competitiveness are closely intertwined in social decision making. In an exploratory examination of this relationship, Study 1 uses field data from a high-stakes TV game show to demonstrate that the frequency by which contestants gaze at their opponent's eyes predicts their defection in a variant on the prisoner's dilemma. Studies 2 and 3 use experiments to examine the underlying causality and demonstrate that the relationship between gazing and competitive behavior is bi-directional. In Study 2, fixation on the eyes, compared to the face, increases competitive behavior toward the target in an ultimatum game. In Study 3, we manipulate the framing of a negotiation (cooperative vs. competitive) and use an eye tracker to measure fixation number and time spent fixating on the counterpart's eyes. We find that a competitive negotiation elicits more gazing, which in turn leads to more competitive behavior.

Evolution of indirect reciprocity by image scoring,"Darwinian evolution has to provide an explanation for cooperative behaviour. Theories of cooperation are based on kin selection (dependent on genetic relatedness), group selection and reciprocal altruism. The idea of reciprocal altruism usually involves direct reciprocity: repeated encounters between the same individuals allow for the return of an altruistic act by the recipients that have helped others in the past. Cooperation pays because it confers the image of a valuable community member to the cooperating individual. We present computer simulations and analytic models that specify the conditions required for evolutionary stability of indirect reciprocity. We show that the probability of knowing the 'image' of the recipient must exceed the cost-to-benefit ratio of the altruistic act. We propose that the emergence of indirect reciprocity was a decisive step for the evolution of human societies.","Nowak, M.A.; Sigmund, K.",Nature,717

Fluoropyrimidine-HAI (hepatic arterial infusion) versus systemic chemotherapy (SCT) for unresectable liver metastases from colorectal cancer,"BACKGROUND: Although locoregional treatments such as hepatic arterial infusion (HAI) claim the advantage of delivering higher doses of anticancer agents directly into the metastatic organ as compared to systemic chemotherapy (SCT), the benefit in terms of overall survival (OS) is unclear. We quantitatively summarized the results of randomised controlled trials (RCT) comparing HAI to SCT for the treatment of unresectable liver metastatic disease from colorectal cancer (CRC). OBJECTIVES: The aim of this work is to quantitatively summarize the results of RCT comparing HAI to SCT for the treatment of unresectable hepatic metastases from CRC. SEARCH STRATEGY: A systematic review of reports published until September 2008 on the findings of RCT that compared HAI to SCT for the treatment of unresectable CRC liver metastases was performed by searching the MEDLINE, Embase, Cancerlit, Cochrane and GoogleScholar electronic databases as well as other databanks collecting information on clinical trials. SELECTION CRITERIA: Inclusion criteria were patients with unresectable CRC liver metastases enrolled in RCT comparing HAI to SCT. The outcome measures were tumor response rate and overall survival. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently carried out study selection and assessment of methodological quality. A third author performed a concordance analysis in order to unravel potential systematic biases. MAIN RESULTS: Ten RCT were identified that met the eligibility criteria. HAI regimens were based on floxuridine (FUDR), 5-fluorouracil or either one of these two fluoropyrimidines in eight and one RCT, respectively. SCT consisted of FUDR or 5-fluorouracil in three and seven RCT, respectively. By pooling the summary data, tumor response rate resulted 42.9% and 18.4% for HAI and SCT, respectively (RR = 2.26; 95% CI, 1.80 to 2.84; P < 0.0001). Mean weighted median OS times were 15.9 and 12.4 months for HAI and SCT, respectively: the meta-risk of death was not statistically different between the two treatment groups (HR = 0.90; 95% CI, 0.76 to 1.07; P = 0.24). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Currently available evidence does not support the clinical or investigational use of fluoropyrimidine-based HAI alone for the treatment of patients with unresectable CRC liver metastases: in fact, the greater tumor response rate obtained with this HAI regimen does not translate into a survival advantage over fluoropyrimidine alone SCT.","Mocellin, Simone; Pasquali, Sandro; Nitti, Donato",Cochrane Database Syst.

Methadone dose and neonatal abstinence syndrome: systematic review and meta-analysis,"The review did not find a consistent statistically significant difference in the incidence of NAS in infants of opioid-dependent pregnant women maintained on differing doses of methadone. XCM: The review question and inclusion criteria were clear. An adequate search of relevant sources was undertaken, with no language restrictions. Publication bias was assessed and no significant evidence for its presence was found. Study selection and data extraction were undertaken in duplicate, which reduced potential for reviewer bias and error. The quality of the included studies was assessed using appropriate criteria and full results of the quality assessment were presented. Appropriate methods were used to pool the included studies and assess statistical heterogeneity; sensitivity analyses were also performed.The authors acknowledged that the lack of blinded assessment of NAS meant that the diagnosis of NAS was potentially biased by knowledge of the maternal methadone dose in the majority of studies. In addition, most studies did not assess the effect of potentially confounding factors on the incidence of NAS. Many of the included studies were small, with around half of the studies including less than 50 neonates. These quality concerns reduce the reliability of the results of the included studies, although they were mitigated by the use of sensitivity analyses restricted to the better quality studies in the review.This was a well-conducted systematic review and the authors' conclusions are likely to be reliable. However, it should be noted that no evidence of a statistically significant difference does not necessarily mean that there is no difference. XIM: Practice: The authors stated that NAS was only one of many factors that patients and their physicians needed to consider when deciding upon appropriate methadone doses during pregnancy; control of maternal withdrawal symptoms and maintenance of stability should take precedence.Research: The authors stated that further adequately designed studies were required to investigate all potential determinants of NAS. They acknowledged that a randomised trial, randomising women to low- or high-dose methadone would have ethical and practical difficulties, and suggest a large prospective cohort study with careful, objective measurement of all potential confounders and blinded assessment of outcomes related to NAS, to determine if methadone dose was an independent predictor of the occurrence of NAS.","Cleary, B J; Donnelly, J; Strawbridge, J; Gallagher, P J; Fahey, T; Clarke, M; Murphy, D J",,725
Three reasons for doubting the adequacy of the reciprocal-concessions explanation of door-in-the-face effects,"This article discusses three broad reasons for concern about the adequacy of the reciprocal-concessions explanation of door-in-the-face (DITF) effects. First, the explanation ù not sufficiently well articulated to permit unambiguous identification of disconfirming evidence. Second, even acknowledging the explanation's suppleness, at least three sets of empirical results (concerning concession size effects, concession emphasis effects, and the necessity of concessions) are apparently inconsistent with the explanation. Third, there is no empirical evidence distinctly supportive of the explanation. © 1999, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","O'Keefe, D.J.",Commun. Stud.,726
People recognise when they are really anonymous in an economic game,"Mounting evidence that cues of being watched can enhance cooperative behaviour questions the existence of 'anonymous', one-shot, non-kin directed cooperation and the validity of using 'anonymous' economic games to empirically measure such behaviour in humans. Here we investigate how sensitive people are to such cuing effects. We test whether people playing an ultimatum game can use explicit information about experimental anonymity to override any effects of cuing in a public context, when faced with both simultaneously. The aims of our study were to investigate whether, (1) individuals respond to experimentally imposed anonymity within a public context and (2) the presence of known others affects cooperative behaviour over and above merely the presence of others. We find that proposer offers did not vary with changes in context (i.e., there was no ""eyes effect"") but did vary with the degree of actual anonymity and the specific presence of known others. Hence, we infer that people recognise when their decisions are anonymous or not and proposers respond to reputation concerns when they are not anonymous. Responder behaviour did not vary with changes in context, degree of actual anonymity or the specific presence of known others. Hence, responders do not respond to reputation concerns and use one uniform strategy, perhaps as long as the payoff structure remains constant. This latter finding may hint at selection in favour of strategies that uniformly ensure near-equal splits of resources in some environments, and thus manifest as strong fairness norms in a population. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.","Lamba, S.; Mace, R.",Evol.

Design/methodology/approach - The paper presents a meta-study of 32 developing country lab experiments correlating cooperative behaviour with prevailing Gini coefficients. Furthermore, the paper conducts standard dictator- and public goods game (PGG) experiments with culturally and demographically similar subject pools in two West African countries characterized by high and persistent variation in national income inequality. Findings - The meta-study findings of a significant negative relationship between income inequality and contribution levels in the PGG are corroborated by the own laboratory experimental findings that participants in more unequal Nigeria are significantly less altruistic and exhibit significantly lower propensities to cooperate than their more egalitarian Ghanaian counterparts. Moreover, the latter findings are robust when controlling for personal income levels. Practical implications - The findings have nontrivial implications for collective action theorists and practitioners seeking to elicit tacit cooperation in developing countries. Originality/value - The major contributions of this paper are the novel meta-analysis and the first attempt to examine the influence of personal income levels on cooperative behaviour in societies characterized by differential levels of income inequality. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Rosenbaum, Stephen Mark; Billinger, Stephan; Twerefou, Daniel Kwabena; Isola, Wakeel Atanda",Int.

Cost-effectiveness of a ROPS retrofit education campaign,"A community educational campaign implemented in two Kentucky counties was effective in influencing farmers to retrofit their tractors with rollover protective structures (ROPS) to protect tractor operators from injury in the event of an overturn. This article reports on the cost-effectiveness of this program in the two counties when compared to no program in a control county. A decision analysis indicated that it would be effective at averting 0.27 fatal and 1.53 nonfatal injuries over a 20-year period, and when this analysis was extended statewide, 7.0 fatal and 40 nonfatal injuries would be averted in Kentucky. Over the 20-year period, the cost-per-injury averted was calculated to be $172,657 at a 4% annual discount rate. This cost compared favorably with a national cost of $489,373 per injury averted despite the additional program cost in Kentucky. The principle reason for the increased cost-effectiveness of the Kentucky program was the three-fold higher propensity for tractors to overturn in Kentucky. The cost-per-injury averted in one of the two counties was $112,535. This lower cost was attributed principally to incentive awards financed locally for farmers to retrofit their tractors with ROPS.","Myers, M L; Cole, H P; Westneat, S C",J. Agric. Saf. Health,731

Demand for charity donations in private non-profit markets. The case of the U.K.,"This paper presents estimates of the demand for donations for U.K. charities in 1985. These estimates make demand depend upon price, fund-raising expenditure, a quality index, and alternative revenue sources. The price elasticity of donations found here shows, for the most part, an elastic response and is consistent with previous studies using U.S. data. Our empirical results suggest that non-profits in the U.K., unlike their counterparts in the U.S., are net revenue maximisers. We discovered no significant evidence that public donations crowded out private donations in our sample of 300 charities. © 1989.","Posnett, J.; Sandler, T.",J. Public Econ.,733
Evolution of direct and indirect reciprocity,"Indirect reciprocity (IR) occurs when individuals help those who help others. It is important as a potential explanation for why people might develop cooperative reputations. However, previous models of IR are based on the assumption that individuals never meet again. Yet humans and other animals often interact repeatedly within groups, thereby violating the fundamental basis of these models. Whenever re-meeting can occur, discriminating reciprocators can decide whether to help those who helped others (IR) or those who helped them (direct reciprocity, DR). Here I used simulation models to investigate the conditions in which we can expect the different forms of reciprocity to predominate. I show that IR through image scoring becomes unstable with respect to DR by experience scoring as the probability of re-meeting increases. However, using the standing strategy, which takes into account the context of observed defections, IR can be stable with respect to DR even when individuals interact with few partners many times. The findings are important in showing that IR cannot explain a concern for reputation in typical societies unless reputations provide as reliable a guide to cooperative behaviour as does experience. © 2007 The Royal Society.","Roberts, G.",Proc.

Moral emotions and moral behavior,"Moral emotions represent a key element of our human moral apparatus, influencing the link between moral standards and moral behavior. This chapter reviews current theory and research on moral emotions. We first focus on a triad of negatively valenced ""self-conscious"" emotions - shame, guilt, and embarrassment. As in previous decades, much research remains focused on shame and guilt. We review current thinking on the distinction between shame and guilt, and the relative advantages and disadvantages of these two moral emotions. Several new areas of research are highlighted: research on the domain-specific phenomenon of body shame, styles of coping with shame, psychobiological aspects of shame, the link between childhood abuse and later proneness to shame, and the phenomena of vicarious or ""collective"" experiences of shame and guilt. In recent years, the concept of moral emotions has been expanded to include several positive emotions - elevation, gratitude, and the sometimes morally relevant experience of pride. Finally, we discuss briefly a morally relevant emotional process - other-oriented empathy. Copyright © 2007 by Annual Reviews. All rights reserved.","Tangney, J.P.; Stuewig, J.; Mashek, D.J.",Annu.

Cost-effectiveness of transfusing virus-inactivated plasma instead of standard plasma,"BACKGROUND: Virus inactivation of plasma intended for transfusion avoids the transmission of hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, and HIV. However, because most plasma recipients also receive other blood components concomitantly, the procedure reduces but cannot eliminate the risk of transfusion-transmitted infection. As virus-inactivated plasma has just been licensed in the United States and other countries, a cost-effectiveness analysis is pertinent. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A Monte Carlo simulation of a Markov model representing the possible outcomes of plasma recipients was used to derive costs and utilities of transfusing virus-inactivated plasma instead of standard plasma. Probability distributions for patients' age and sex and for the number of blood components transfused per case were determined in 924 plasma recipients in a tertiary-care hospital. Other values were obtained from the medical literature. Results of the baseline and sensitivity analyses are the mean (+/- SD) of 10 simulations with 10(7) patients per simulation. RESULTS: In the baseline analysis, transfusing virus-inactivated plasma instead of standard plasma prolonged the quality-adjusted survival by 1 hour and 11 minutes per patient, at a cost-effectiveness ratio of $2,156,398 +/- $257,587 per quality-adjusted life year gained. Cost-effectiveness was most sensitive to the patients' mean age, the incremental cost per unit of virus-inactivated plasma, the HIV and hepatitis C virus transmission rates, and the short-term mortality of plasma recipients due to their underlying diseases. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to most accepted medical procedures, the transfusion of virus-inactivated plasma produces little health benefit at a very high cost. This poor cost-effectiveness ratio is due to the low current risk of infection with transfusion-transmitted viruses and to the greater age and poor short-term prognosis of most plasma recipients.","Pereira, A",Transfusion,736
Volunteer decision making by older people: A test of a revised theory of planned behavior,"This study was designed to test the utility of a revised theory of planned behavior in the prediction of intentions to volunteer among older people. Such a perspective allowed for the consideration of a broader range of social and contextual factors than has been examined in previous research on volunteer decision making among older people. The article reports the findings from a study that investigated volunteer intentions and behavior in a random sample of older people aged 65 to 74 years living in an Australian capital city. Results showed that, as predicted by the revised theory of planned behavior, intention to volunteer predicted subsequent reported volunteer behavior. Intention was, in turn, predicted by social norms (both subjective and behavioral), perceived behavioral control, and moral obligation, with the effect of attitude being mediated through moral obligation.","Warburton, J.; Terry, D.J.",Basic Appl.

Individual taxpayer response to tax cuts: 1982-1984. With implications for the revenue maximizing tax rate,"This paper measures the response of taxpayers to the U.S. personal rate reductions from 1982 to 1984. A baseline income distribution is created to describe what level and distribution could be expected in the absence of tax changes. Comparison of this baseline with actual tax return data shows that at least one-sixth, and probably one-quarter, of the revenue ascribable to the rate reductions was recouped by changes in taxpayer behavior. The data also show that federal income tax revenue would have been maximized at a tax rate of about 35 percent, and total income tax revenue maximized at a total tax rate of about 40 percent. © 1987.","Lindsey, L.B.",J.

Oral nutritional interventions in malnourished patients with cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Oral nutrition interventions were effective for increasing nutritional intake and improving some aspects of quality of life, but did not appear to improve survival in patients with cancer who were malnourished or at risk of malnutrition. XCM: The review addressed a clear question. Inclusion criteria were defined. A range of appropriate databases were searched for relevant studies. There were no language restrictions applied to the search and some attempts were made by the reviewers to identify unpublished studies. Steps were taken at each stage of the review process to minimise errors and biases. Methodological quality was assessed; the included trials were found to be of low to moderate quality. There was substantial clinical heterogeneity in the trials in cancer type and stage, interventions, length of study and follow-up, which meant that pooling of some of the results may not have been appropriate. Statistical heterogeneity was observed across the results. The authors acknowledged the limitations of the review including clinical and statistical heterogeneity across the trials, and the uncertain clinical significance of the results. Although the authors concluded that oral nutritional interventions were effective for increasing nutritional intake, the removal from the results of two heterogeneous trials showed no statistically significant differences between intervention and comparator groups.Substantial variation in the results across the included trials means that the reliability of the authors' conclusion is unclear. XIM: Practice: The authors did not state any implications for practice.Research: The authors stated that studies were required to determine the components of nutritional interventions which contribute to their effectiveness in patients with cancer and malnutrition to strengthen the evidence base for nutritional and dietary management during cancer treatment.","Baldwin, C; Spiro, A; Ahern, R; Emery, P W",,742
Effects of the price of charitable giving: Evidence from an online crowdfunding platform,"A long literature has examined the effects of the price of giving - that is, the amount an individual must give for one dollar to accrue to the charitable activity itself - on donative behavior. We use data from DonorsChoose.org, an online platform linking teachers with prospective donors that are uniquely suited to addressing this question due to exogenous variation in overhead costs. An increased price of giving results in a lower likelihood of a project being funded. We also calculate the price elasticity of giving, finding estimates between -0.8 and -2. Finally, we examine the effect of competition on giving and find that increased competition reduces the likelihood of a project being funded. These results provide insight into the workings of the market for charitable gifts. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Meer, J.",J. Econ. Behav. Organ.,743

Systematic review of oncological outcomes following surgical management of localised renal cancer,"The evidence base suggested that localised renal cell cancer was best managed using partial rather than radical nephrectomy, but further evidence was required. XCM: The review question and inclusion criteria were clear. The search included a good coverage of electronic databases and attempts were made to identify unpublished studies. Appropriate methods were used to minimise error and bias for study selection and quality assessment, but it was unclear if this was also the case for data extraction.The use of narrative synthesis to summarise the data appeared appropriate given the heterogeneity and low quality of the studies. While there was some evidence for the benefit of partial over radical nephrectomy, this was based on low quality and contradictory data, so the authors' conclusion is may not be reliable. XIM: Practice: The authors stated that renal cell cancer was best managed using partial nephrectomy.Research: The authors stated that well designed and well reported prospective studies (ideally randomised) were required.

When Suits Meet Roots: The Antecedents and Consequences of Community Engagement Strategy,"Understanding firms’ interfaces with the community has become a familiar strategic concern for both firms and non-profit organizations. However, it is still not clear when different community engagement strategies are appropriate or how such strategies might benefit the firm and community. In this review, we examine when, how and why firms benefit from community engagement strategies through a systematic review of over 200 academic and practitioner knowledge sources on the antecedents and consequences of community engagement strategy. We analytically describe evidence on the rise of the community engagement strategy literature over time, its geographical spread and methodological evolution. A foundational concept underlying many studies is the ‘continuum of community engagement’. We build on this continuum to develop a typology of three engagement strategies: transactional, transitional and transformational engagement. By identifying the antecedents and outcomes of the three strategies, we find that the payoffs from engagement are largely longer-term enhanced firm legitimacy, rather than immediate cost–benefit improvements. We use our systematic review to draw implications for future research and managerial practice.

The psychological contract and volunteering: A systematic review,"This paper explores the use of the concept of the psychological contract in investigating the experience of volunteers and its potential to help develop strategies to attract, retain, and support volunteers and the mission of non-profit organizations who their efforts support, through a systematic review of what we know about the psychological contract in relation to volunteers. Following the PRISMA, PIECES, and Warwick protocols, we conducted a search of empirical research in business and broader social sciences and humanities databases. From the initial 6,042 studies reviewed, 29 met the inclusion criteria that focused on peer-reviewed journal articles published in English.

A guilt-based explanation of the door-in-the-face influence strategy,"A new explanation is proposed for the accumulated research findings concerning the door-in-the-face (DITF) influence strategy. The explanation treats successful DITF implementations as based on guilt: Refusal of the first request creates guilt, and compliance with the second request reduces guilt. In addition to explaining the known effects of DITF moderator variables, the explanation is consistent with current theoretical and empirical understandings of the nature of guilt and with extant research findings concerning guilt-based social influence. This explanation also suggests a significant role for a new moderator, the identity of the beneficiary of the requests. A reanalysis of previous meta-analytic findings confirms the importance of that moderator.","O'Keefe, D.J.; Figgé, M.",Hum. Commun. Res.,748
A nexus model of the temporal-parietal junction,"The temporal-parietal junction (TPJ) has been proposed to support either specifically social functions or non-specific processes of cognition such as memory and attention. To account for diverse prior findings, we propose a nexus model for TPJ function: overlap of basic processes produces novel secondary functions at their convergence. We present meta-analytic evidence that is consistent with the anatomical convergence of attention, memory, language, and social processing in the TPJ, leading to a higher-order role in the creation of a social context for behavior. The nexus model accounts for recent examples of TPJ contributions specifically to decision making in a social context and provides a potential reconciliation for competing claims about TPJ function.","Carter, R Mckell; Huettel, Scott A",Trends Cogn.

Crowdfunding Acts as a Funding Substitute and a Legitimating Signal for Nonprofit Performing Arts Organizations,"This research examines the relationship between crowdfunding campaigns by nonprofit performing arts organizations and their overall fundraising portfolio. Using a dataset compiled from the CrowdBerkeley Initiative and the Cultural Data Project, we find an important link between campaign success and organization age. For young organizations, crowdfunding success attracts funding in the subsequent year, while a failed campaign significantly hampers the organization’s ability to raise funds, suggesting that crowdfunding acts as a legitimating signal. In contrast, older organizations appear to be insulated from the negative effects of a failed campaign. In addition, higher amounts raised in the campaign are associated with a substitution or “crowding out” effect for other types of funding for young organizations, but this effect reverses for older organizations. This suggests that crowdfunding should not only be considered a tool for younger organizations, but also holds promise for established organizations. © The Author(s) 2020.","Alexiou, K.; Wiggins, J.; Preece, S.B.",Nonprofit Volunt.

Using descriptive social norms to increase charitable giving: The power of local norms,"In a field experiment, we examined whether conveying descriptive social norms (e.g., ""this is what most people do"") increases charitable giving. Additionally, we examined whether people are more likely to conform to the local norms of one's immediate environment than to more global norms extending beyond one's local environment. University students received a charity organization's information brochure and were asked for a monetary contribution. An experimental descriptive norm manipulation was embedded in the brochure. We found that providing people with descriptive norms increased charitable giving substantially compared with industry standard altruistic appeals (control condition). Moreover, conveying local norms were more effective in increasing charitable giving than conveying global norms. Practical implications for charity organizations and marketing are proposed. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Agerström, J.; Carlsson, R.; Nicklasson, L.; Guntell, L.",J. Econ. Psychol.,753

Facing yourself – A note on self-image,"The concern for a positive self-image is a central assumption in a large class of signaling models. In this paper, we exogenously vary the impact of self-image concerns by manipulating self-directed attention and study the impact on moral behavior. The choice context in the experiment is whether subjects inflict a painful electric shock on another subject to receive a monetary reward. In the main treatment, subjects see their own face on the decision screen in a real-time video feed. In three control conditions, subjects see either no video at all or a neutral video, or they see themselves in a mirror. We find that increasing self-awareness significantly reduces the fraction of subjects inflicting pain. The finding emphasizes the importance of self-image concerns for moral decision making with implications for theory as well as practical applications to promote socially desirable outcomes. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Falk, A.",J.

The impact of dementia in the prison setting: A systematic review,"Older prisoners are the fastest growing group in the prison population, with an accelerated aging process they are at a high risk of developing dementia. However, no systematic review has explored the impact of dementia in the prison setting. The objectives of this review were to identify the prevalence of dementia in the prison setting and how prison, health and social care providers assess, diagnose, treat, support and care for prisoners with dementia. A systematic search of the literature from the following databases was undertaken: CINHAL, PubMed, BNI, PsychINFO, and MEDLINE. Search strategies were tailored for each database and included recognised Medical Subject Headings. Hand searching of prominent journals in correctional services and dementia, as well as reference lists of included papers was completed. Open Grey website was searched to identify relevant government, local council and charity publications regarding dementia in the prison setting. The appropriate Critical Appraisal Skills Programmes Checklist for all included studies was completed. Following the application of inclusion and exclusion criteria, 10 studies were included in the review. Due to the nature of the data extracted, a meta-synthesis was not possible; therefore, a thematic synthesis was completed. Three themes emerged: prevalence of dementia in the prison population, identification of older prisoner's needs, and knowledge of correctional officers and legal professionals. The prevalence and incidence of dementia in prison populations remain largely unknown. There is a need for national policies and local strategies that support a multi-disciplinary approach to early detection, screening and diagnosis of cognitive impairment and dementia across prison settings.

We test these data for consistency with utility maximization, and we recover the underlying preferences for giving (trade-offs between own payoffs and the payoffs of others). Two further experiments augment the analysis. An extensive elaboration employs three-person budget sets to distinguish preferences for giving from social preferences (trade-offs between the payoffs of others). And an intensive elaboration employs step-shaped sets to distinguish between behaviors that are compatible with well-behaved preferences and those compatible only with not well-behaved cases.","Fisman, R.; Kariv, S.; Markovits, D.",Am.

Medications for increasing milk supply in mothers expressing breastmilk for their preterm hospitalised infants,"BACKGROUND: Breastmilk remains the optimal form of enteral nutrition for term and preterm infants until up to six months postnatal age. Mothers of preterm infants who have not established suck feeds must express their breastmilk and often have difficulty in maintaining sufficient volume for their infants' needs (Donath 2008). In preterm infants, donor breastmilk reduced the occurrence of necrotising enterocolitis, when compared with formula feeds (McGuire 2003). Also, case-control studies have suggested that breastmilk is associated with an improvement in feeding tolerance, a reduction in significant gastrointestinal infective events (Beeby 1992) and a reduction in late-onset sepsis (Schanler 1999) when compared with formula feeds in preterm hospitalised infants. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effect of medication given for at least seven days to mothers of preterm infants whose breastmilk is insufficient for their infants' needs on the outcomes of expressed milk volume and duration of breastfeeding. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 December 2011). SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials of breastmilk-augmenting medications (compared with placebo or with other augmenting medications) in mothers with preterm hospitalised infants whose breastmilk volumes failed to meet their infants' requirements. We did not include trials with a cluster-randomised or cross-over design. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Both review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data. Any differences were resolved by consensus. Data were checked for accuracy. MAIN RESULTS: Two trials (involving 59 mothers) that examined the use of domperidone in a total of 59 mother-infant pairs met the inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis of these trials showed a modest increase in expressed breastmilk (EBM) of 99.49 mL/day (95% confidence intervals -1.94 to 200.92; random-effects, T² 3511.62, I² 63%) in mothers given domperidone. Both trials gave the same dose of domperidone (10 mg three times per day) with a duration of seven days in the smaller trial and 14 days in the larger.Neither trial showed significant improvements in longer-term outcomes of breastfeeding in a preterm population and no adverse effects were reported. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Two studies with a total of 59 mothers suggest modest improvements in short-term EBM volumes when a medication is used after insufficient EBM occurs in mothers following preterm delivery. In both studies, the medication was commenced ≧14 days post delivery and following insufficient EBM supply with other lactation supports.Currently, no studies support prophylactic use of a galactagogue medication at any gestation. Use of any galactagogue medication has only been examined at more than 14 days post delivery and after full lactation support has been given. Further trials should examine larger groups of preterm mothers and consider breastfeeding outcomes over a longer period.","Donovan, Timothy J; Buchanan, Kerry",Cochrane Database Syst. Rev.,758

Towards an Emerging Paradigm: Is Social Entrepreneurship an Insight into Contemporary Society?,"From historical till contemporary era, overwhelming changes happening within varieties of contextual factors (namely, society, economy, culture, environment and education) challenge the field of research in entrepreneurship. ``Old'' nature with ``mold and cliche'' of entrepreneurship is thus moving to a new direction by embracing community and related social value attributed to its concern. Defined as ``social change agents'', the ultimate goal of social entrepreneurs is to promote ``social justice'' as a whole by ``dealing with social needs'', blurring the edges between ``society and enterprises'' among ``public, private and non-profit sectors''. With a critical thinking of current literature related to social entrepreneurship, series of concepts are emerging and gaining interests from both theoretical and practical perspectives, such as ethics, morality, ethical suspect behaviour, (corporate) social responsibility (CSR), social justice, philanthropy, charity, altruism, virtuous, sustainability, etc. By borrowing social constructivism as our theoretical lens, we plan to meet our research objectives through gathering findings based on the following questions: theoretically, why is it important to analyse social entrepreneurship? What are the inner-relationships among those emerging concepts in the horizon of social entrepreneurship research? What are the interrelationships between those concepts and social entrepreneurship? Although this study is still in a preliminary stage, it can to some extent lead more worthwhile explorations further such as theoretical and practical argumentations. Additionally, it is also significant to envision practically for the future research - what contributions our research can make for improving social entrepreneurship education and how to develop the relevant concepts into education and training programs. By collecting the literature material as covering recent 10 years (from 2005 to 2015), 37 articles have been targeted which are necessary for us to conduct a meta-analysis of relevant socially-constructed discourses. Considering those corresponding concepts, social entrepreneurship is giving inspiring ideas for traditional entrepreneurship research and vitalizing it towards a more developing trend. And more relevant concepts will evolve in social entrepreneurship research; they can be involved into consideration and debate. It is also necessarily important to realize the way how to educate students and how to train entrepreneurs for the social changes in our contemporary era. ATLAS.ti will be utilized as a support tool.","Wang, Qian; Aaltio, Iiris",Proceedings of the European Conference on Entrepreneurship and Innovation,764
Adult ADHD: Associations with Personality and Other Psychopathology,"The goals of this study were to explicate adult ADHD’s relations with personality at both the domain and facet levels and to examine its associations with other psychological symptoms. Community members (N = 294) completed measures assessing ADHD inattentive and hyperactive/impulsive symptoms, five-factor model personality domains and facets, and other internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Inattentiveness showed strong negative relations with conscientiousness and extraversion and strong positive relations with neuroticism; in contrast, hyperactivity/impulsivity related negatively to agreeableness, positively to extraversion, and weakly to neuroticism. Whereas inattentiveness emerged as a positive predictor of internalizing psychopathology—and depression in particular—hyperactivity/impulsivity related weakly to internalizing but more strongly to externalizing psychopathology. Thus, inattentive and hyperactive/impulsive symptoms showed differential relations with personality—at both the domain and facet levels—and with other psychological symptoms. These results demonstrate the value in examining ADHD’s relations with personality facets and with a wide range of psychopathology within the same study. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Stanton, K; Watson, D",J.

The identifiable victim effect in charitable giving: evidence from a natural field experiment,"We design a natural field experiment to enhance our understanding of the role of the identifiable victim effect in charitable giving. Using direct mail solicitations to 25 797 prior donors of a nonprofit charity, we tested the responsiveness of donors to make a contribution to either an identifiable or a statistical victim. Unlike much previous research, which has used only laboratory experiments, we find that the campaign letter focusing on one identifiable victim did not result in significantly larger donations than the campaign letter focusing on the statistical victim. In addition to the role of the identifiable victim, we investigate the degree to which each of our campaign letters affected donors’ payments to other concurrent and future campaigns and whether there is decreasing marginal returns to campaigning in the sense that receiving a letter crowds out donors’ payments to other future and concurrent campaigns. We find some evidence of crowding out, indicating that charitable giving could be a zero-sum game; however, the treatment letters did not have different effects on other payments. © 2014, © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","Lesner, T.H.; Rasmussen, O.D.",Appl.

Study populations are small and heterogeneous. In general, there are few RCTs with small control groups and with significant methodological defects. This makes it difficult to compare studies.Therefore, there is inadequate evidence supporting the clinical use of this technology, especially beyond 24 months of use. When all the studies are considered together, it is not possible to show a clear advantage of this technology over other surgical procedures, especially, in the case of spinal fusion. As to cervical discs, it is not possible to establish their safety and efficacy because no direct comparative data against other options such as dissectomy with or without fusion are available.","A, Pichon Riviere; Augustovski, F; Alcaraz, A; Bardach, A; S, Garcia Marti; Lopez, A; Glujovsky, D; Regueiro, A",,769
Imputing variance estimates do not alter the conclusions of a meta-analysis with continuous outcomes: a case study of changes in renal function after living kidney donation,"OBJECTIVE: To assess how different imputation methods used to account for missing variance data in primary studies influence tests of heterogeneity and pooled results from a meta-analysis with continuous outcomes. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Point and variance estimates for changes in serum creatinine, glomerular filtration rate, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure were variably reported among 48 primary longitudinal studies of living kidney donors (71%-78% of point estimates were reported, 8%-13% of variance data were reported). We compared the results of meta-analysis, which either were restricted to available data or used four methods to impute missing variance data. These methods used reported P-values, reported nonparametric summaries, results from other similar studies using multiple imputation, or results from estimated correlation coefficients. RESULTS: Significant heterogeneity was present in all four outcomes regardless of the imputation methods applied. The random effects point estimates and 95% confidence intervals varied little across imputation methods, and the differences were not clinically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Different methods to impute the variance data in the primary studies did not alter the conclusions from this meta-analysis of continuous outcomes. Such reproducibility increases confidence in the results. However, as with most meta-analyses, there was no gold standard of truth, and results must be interpreted judiciously. The generalization of these findings to other meta-analyses, which differ in outcomes, missing data, or between-study heterogeneity, requires further consideration.","Thiessen Philbrook, H; Barrowman, N; Garg, A X",J.

Perioperative nurses' attitudes towards organ procurement: a systematic review,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To explore and evaluate perioperative nurses' experience of organ procurement. BACKGROUND: Organ procurement is part of the organ donation process, and is typically performed in the perioperative setting. This experience may contribute to perioperative nurses' feelings of distress and negative attitudes towards organ donation. DESIGN: Systematic review of the literature. METHOD: Primary research studies, published in the English language between 1990-2014 were identified, screened and appraised using Joanna Briggs Institute appraisal tools. Data extraction and analysis followed. RESULTS: The quality assessment resulted in seven qualitative and three quantitative research studies. The main findings were: (1) Perioperative nurses reported feeling emotionally distressed, challenged, lonely and physically drained throughout the entire organ procurement procedure. (2) Perioperative nurses reported finding their own unique self-coping strategies and ways of eliciting support. (3) Perioperative nurses had positive and negative attitudes towards organ donation. CONCLUSION: Perioperative nurses reported feelings of sadness, feeling challenged and physically drained through the entire organ procurement procedure, which were influenced by differing factors in the preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative stages. It is acknowledged that personal coping strategies and support are important to help perioperative nurses improve their psychological well-being, and their experiences and attitudes towards organ procurement and donation. The meaningfulness of these findings for practice policy and research is described. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Perioperative nurses play a vital role in the organ procurement procedure and require ongoing support to ensure their psychological welfare, in particular, newly qualified or inexperienced nurses' participating in organ procurement.","Gao, Weili; Plummer, Virginia; Williams, Allison",J.

Cost-effectiveness of organ donation: evaluating investment into donor action and other donor initiatives,"Initiatives aimed at increasing organ donation can be considered health care interventions, and will compete with other health care interventions for limited resources. We have developed a model capable of calculating the cost-utility of organ donor initiatives and applied it to Donor Action, a successful international program designed to optimize donor practices. The perspective of the payer in the Canadian health care system was chosen. A Markov model was developed to estimate the net present value incremental lifetime direct medical costs and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) as a consequence of increased kidney transplantation rates. Cost-saving and cost-effectiveness thresholds were calculated. The effects of changing the success rate and time frame of the intervention was examined as a sensitivity analysis. Transplantation results in a gain of 1.99 QALYs and a cost savings of Can$104,000 over the 20-year time frame compared with waiting on dialysis. Implementation of an intervention such as Donor Action, which produced as few as three extra donors per million population, would be cost-effective at a cost of Can$1.0 million per million population. The cost-effectiveness of Donor Action and other organ donor initiatives compare favorably to other health care interventions. Organ donation may be underfunded in North America.","Whiting, James F; Kiberd, Bryce; Kalo, Zoltan; Keown, Paul; Roels, Leo; Kjerulf, Maria",Am. J. Transplant,772
Elderly consumers and financial choices: A systematic review,"The purpose of this paper is to investigate elderly choices and behaviors in financial services markets. A systematic review of a five-decade period (1970–2019) of academic research in the marketing field was carried out in order to identify elderly consumers’ decisions regarding financial asset management and legacy, highlighting the main findings of extant research and practical implications for marketers. Results shed light on financial asset management in terms of welfare, retirement planning, and investments for old age, as well as legacy practices in terms of special possessions, charities, and rites of passage. The study underlines the need to consider the heterogeneous nature of elderly consumers’ values and lifestyles in designing strategies for financial services and products, emphasizing that demographic differences alone are not adequate to effectively define market segments. Furthermore, the role of mixed marketing approaches considering elderly choices are discussed, together with implications for companies that want to target such consumer target. © 2020, The Author(s).","Guido, G.; Amatulli, C.; Sestino, A.",J.

Perceiving Persons and Groups,"This article analyzes the similarities and differences in forming impressions of individuals and in developing conceptions of groups. In both cases, the perceiver develops a mental conception of the target (individual or group) on the basis of available information and uses that information to make judgments about that person or group. However, a review of existing evidence reveals differences in the outcomes of impressions formed of individual and group targets, even when those impressions are based on the very same behavioral information. A model is proposed to account for these differences. The model emphasizes the role of differing expectancies of unity and coherence in individual and group targets, which in turn engage different mechanisms for processing information and making judgments. Implications of the model are discussed.","Hamilton, D.L.; Sherman, S.J.",Psychol. Rev.,774
An experimental study of the generosity game,"We study ultimatum and dictator variants of the generosity game. In this game, the first mover chooses the amount of money to be distributed between the players within a given interval, knowing that her own share is fixed. Thus, the first mover is not confronted with the typical trade-off between her own and the other's payoff. For each variant of the game, we study three treatments that vary the range of potential pie sizes so as to assess the influence of these changes on the first movers' generosity. We find that removing the trade-off inspires significant generosity, which is not always affected by the second mover's veto power. Moreover, the manipulation of the choice set indicates that choices are influenced by the available alternatives. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Güth, W.; Levati, M.V.; Ploner, M.",Theory Decis,775
Partners in giving: The crowding-in effects of UK government grants,"This study examines the determinants of voluntary donations to UK charities, using empirical specifications that combine error-component and simultaneous-equations methods. In a series of tests, we identify the one-way fixed-effects endogenous representation for government grants as the best empirical model. When this endogeneity is taken into account, government grants cause significant crowding-in for the full sample and the two largest cohorts. Price coefficients are negative, and fund-raising coefficients are positive. Religion charities are net revenue maximizers; whereas other charity cohorts fund raise short of net revenue maximization.

Evolutionary theory and the ultimate-proximate distinction in the human behavioral sciences,"To properly understand behavior, we must obtain both ultimate and proximate explanations. Put briefly, ultimate explanations are concerned with why a behavior exists, and proximate explanations are concerned with how it works. These two types of explanation are complementary and the distinction is critical to evolutionary explanation. We are concerned that they have become conflated in some areas of the evolutionary literature on human behavior. This article brings attention to these issues. We focus on three specific areas: he evolution of cooperation, transmitted culture, and epigenetics. We do this to avoid confusion and wasted effort-dangers that are particularly acute in interdisciplinary research. Throughout this article, we suggest ways in which misunderstanding may be avoided in the future. © The Author(s) 2011.","Scott-Phillips, T.C.; Dickins, T.E.; West, S.A.",Perspect. Psychol. Sci.,778
Interventions to reduce the sexual risk behaviour of injecting drug users,"Reducing the risk of sexual HIV transmission by injecting drug users (IDUs) is important for controlling the HIV epidemic among all drug users and for controlling the larger epidemic. Over the past few years, several qualitative and meta-analyses reviews have been published. Most of these reviews involved numerous studies conducted in resource-rich countries, while a few covered the smaller number of studies undertaken in resource-constrained countries. In order to make greater strides in controlling the HIV epidemic, we assessed the generalisability of the results of the major studies and reviews for use in developing programmes in resource-constrained countries. We also discuss the implications for global research efforts and public health practice. The reviews show that IDUs in both resource-rich and resource-constrained countries have changed their sexual risk behaviours, reflecting rational and altruistic responses to a major health threat. Findings show that IDUs changed their sexual risk behaviour to avoid becoming infected with HIV and to avoid transmitting HIV to their sexual partners. Although the risk-reduction effect is moderate, it is important to implement programmes to reduce the sexual risk behaviour of IDUs in all countries. Providing evidence-based interventions is ethically responsible compared to providing no interventions. As interventions are implemented in different settings, it is important to bear in mind that stigmatisation of HIV/AIDS, or drug or condom use may limit an intervention's effectiveness. There is a need for research on adapting interventions to different cultural or national settings, and to develop and evaluate new interventions that may produce greater reductions in sexual risk behaviours.","Jarlais, Don C Des; Semaan, Salaam",International Journal of Drug Policy,779
Global Philanthropy: Does Institutional Context Matter for Charitable Giving?,"In this article, we examine whether and how the institutional context matters when understanding individuals’ giving to philanthropic organizations. We posit that both the individuals’ propensity to give and the amounts given are higher in countries with a stronger institutional context for philanthropy. We examine key factors of formal and informal institutional contexts for philanthropy at both the organizational and societal levels, including regulatory and legislative frameworks, professional standards, and social practices. Our results show that while aggregate levels of giving are higher in countries with stronger institutionalization, multilevel analyses of 118,788 individuals in 19 countries show limited support for the hypothesized relationships between institutional context and philanthropy. The findings suggest the need for better comparative data to understand the complex and dynamic influences of institutional contexts on charitable giving. This, in turn, would support the development of evidence-based practices and policies in the field of global philanthropy. © The Author(s) 2021.","Wiepking, P.; Handy, F.; Park, S.; Neumayr, M.; Bekkers, R.; Breeze, B.; de Wit, A.; Einolf, C.J.; Gricevic, Z.; Scaife, W.; Bethmann, S.; Breen, O.B.; Kang, C.; Katz, H.; Krasnopolskaya, I.; Layton, M.D.; Mersianova, I.; Lo, K.-T.; Osili, U.; Pessi, A.B.; Sivesind, K.H.; Yamauchi, N.; Yang, Y.",Nonprofit Volunt.

The Legitimization of Paltry Contributions as a Compliance-Gaining Technique: A Meta-Analysis Testing Three Explanations,"The legitimization of paltry contributions (LPC) has been shown to be an effective compliance-gaining technique across a variety of empirical investigations. However, the theoretical explanations regarding the effectiveness of the tactic and the effects of LPC messages on donation amounts warrant further consideration. A meta-analytic review of LPC research was conducted to examine these issues. Consistent with a prior meta-analysis, LPC messages increased compliance rates (r = .22, k = 34, n = 3,181) relative to control conditions. Three moderators were also tested. The results indicated that impression management concerns and perceptions of requestor need explained the effects of LPC messages on compliance rates. A second analysis (r = −.23, k = 11, n = 1,531) offered evidence that LPC messages led to smaller mean donation amounts. A third analysis showed that LPC messages produced similar donation totals relative to control messages.

The Identifiable Victim Effect: Using an Experimental-Causal-Chain Design to Test for Mediation,"The identifiable victim effect (IVE) refers to individuals’ tendency to offer greater aid to identifiable victims than to statistical victims. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether emotional reactions work to mediate IVE. In two experiments based on the experimental-causal-chain design proposed by Spencer et al. (Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 89, 845–851, 2005), it was shown that an identifiable victim evokes stronger emotional reactions than does a statistical victim (Study 1). It was also demonstrated that the identifiable victim shown or described with a specific expression or information to evoke stronger emotional reactions elicited greater willingness to donate money in participants (Study 2). The results of two studies based on the experimental-causal-chain approach demonstrated that the underlying causal mechanism for the IVE is participants’ emotional reactions to identified victims.

Inventory of data sources for estimating health care costs in the United States,"OBJECTIVE: To develop an inventory of data sources for estimating health care costs in the United States and provide information to aid researchers in identifying appropriate data sources for their specific research questions. METHODS: We identified data sources for estimating health care costs using 3 approaches: (1) a review of the 18 articles included in this supplement, (2) an evaluation of websites of federal government agencies, non profit foundations, and related societies that support health care research or provide health care services, and (3) a systematic review of the recently published literature. Descriptive information was abstracted from each data source, including sponsor, website, lowest level of data aggregation, type of data source, population included, cross-sectional or longitudinal data capture, source of diagnosis information, and cost of obtaining the data source. Details about the cost elements available in each data source were also abstracted. RESULTS: We identified 88 data sources that can be used to estimate health care costs in the United States. Most data sources were sponsored by government agencies, national or nationally representative, and cross-sectional. About 40% were surveys, followed by administrative or linked administrative data, fee or cost schedules, discharges, and other types of data. Diagnosis information was available in most data sources through procedure or diagnosis codes, self-report, registry, or chart review. Cost elements included inpatient hospitalizations (42.0%), physician and other outpatient services (45.5%), outpatient pharmacy or laboratory (28.4%), out-of-pocket (22.7%), patient time and other direct nonmedical costs (35.2%), and wages (13.6%). About half were freely available for downloading or available for a nominal fee, and the cost of obtaining the remaining data sources varied by the scope of the project. CONCLUSIONS: Available data sources vary in population included, type of data source, scope, and accessibility, and have different strengths and weaknesses for specific research questions.","Lund, Jennifer L; Yabroff, K Robin; Ibuka, Yoko; Russell, Louise B; Barnett, Paul G; Lipscomb, Joseph; Lawrence, William F; Brown, Martin L",Med.

Positive Effects of Television on Children's Social Interactions: A Meta-Analysis,"We conducted a meta-analysis of 34 studies of the positive effects of television on children's social interactions, levels of aggression, altruism, and levels of stereotyping (a total of 108 effect sizes, 5,473 children). Across dependent measures, there were consistent moderate positive effects for those who watched prosocial content in experimental settings compared to control groups or those who watched antisocial content. Moreover, the positive effect of self-selected exposure to prosocial content was as strong as the negative effect of self-selected exposure to violent content. Effects were largest for depictions of altruism, primarily because such content tended to involve explicit modeling of desired behaviors. Strong negative effects occurred in the few studies where children watched aggressive prosocial content.

Estimated tax price elasticities suggest that changes in the tax treatment of charitable contributions could lead to substantial reductions in monetary donations.

Social Rewards: From Basic Social Building Blocks to Complex Social Behavior,"Humans are social creatures, engaging almost constantly in social behaviors that serve ultimate social goals, such as forming strong bonds with one another. However, most social behaviors provide only incremental progress toward an ultimate goal. Instead, the drive to engage in any individual social act may derive from its proximal value rather than its ultimate goal. Thus, this proximal value forms the foundation on which the complexities of human sociality are built. We describe two complementary approaches for using proximal social rewards to understand social behaviors and their ultimate goals: (a) decontextualizing social rewards—paring down complex social interactions can help identify which basic building blocks remain valuable even in minimalistic contexts—and (b) recontextualizing social rewards—reintroducing motivational and contextual factors into the study of social experience can help identify how proximal rewards serve their ultimate function. We discuss how this dual-approach framework can inform future research by bridging basic social building blocks and real-world social goals. © The Author(s) 2018.","Tamir, D.I.; Hughes, B.L.",Perspect.

It depends who is watching you: 3-D agent cues increase fairness,"Laboratory and field studies have demonstrated that exposure to cues of intentional agents in the form of eyes can increase prosocial behavior. However, previous research mostly used 2-dimensional depictions as experimental stimuli. Thus far no study has examined the influence of the spatial properties of agency cues on this prosocial effect. To investigate the role of dimensionality of agency cues on fairness, 345 participants engaged in a decisionmaking task in a naturalistic setting. The experimental treatment included a 3-dimensional pseudo-realistic model of a human head and a 2-dimensional picture of the same object. The control stimuli consisted of a real plant and its 2-D image. Our results partly support the findings of previous studies that cues of intentional agents increase prosocial behavior. However, this effect was only found for the 3-D cues, suggesting that dimensionality is a critical variable in triggering these effects in a real-world settings. Our research sheds light on a hitherto unexplored aspect of the effects of environmental cues and their morphological properties on decision-making. © 2016 Krátký et al.

The Door-in-the-Face Persuasive Message Strategy: A Meta-Analysis of the First 35 Years,"A random-effects meta-analysis was undertaken to examine the effectiveness of the Door-in-the-Face (DITF) persuasive message strategy on compliance. Results indicate an overall significant effect of the DITF strategy on verbal compliance (k=78, r=.126), but an insignificant effect for behavioral compliance (k=39, r=.052). In terms of verbal compliance, the DITF strategy works significantly better than controls for different samples, across varied communication media, and for prosocial causes. Additionally, the DITF technique is more successful than controls for volunteering/research than other target behaviors (e.g., monetary donation). For both verbal and behavioral compliance outcomes, the toughness (measured as amount of baseline compliance) of the donation context negatively predicted the magnitude of the DITF effect. It is argued social responsibility theory best accounts for observed moderator factors.

"To be(come) or not to be(come) an organ donor, that's the question: a meta-analysis of determinant and intervention studies","A meta-analysis was conducted to quantify profiles of posthumous organ donors. Bibliographic databases were used to identify 1280 psychosocial studies on organ donation published from 1970 until February 2007. Methodological quality of 220 studies with relevant abstracts was assessed. Twenty-four studies comparing registered organ donors and those who had not made their organ donation preference explicit were included in the meta-analysis. Log odds ratios (LOR) and standard errors (SELOR) were calculated for ‘demographic characteristics’, standardised mean differences (ESsm) and standard errors (SEsm) for ‘psychosocial factors’. A random effects model was used to pool the studies. ‘Education’, ‘religion’, ‘knowledge’, ‘attitude’, ‘social influence’, ‘family discussion’, and ‘altruism’ significantly predicted donor status in a positive way. The variables ‘fear of death’, and ‘organ donation-related fear’ were negatively related to registered donor status. mmb Organ donation promotion programmes should focus on fear reduction, emphasising positive aspects, and bringing about a positive social norm encouraged by altruistic motives. Lower educated people should be a specific priority group for organ donation promotion programmes.

Generosity and livelihoods: Dictator game evidence on the multidimensional nature of sharing among the Kenyan Maasai,This paper investigates whether sharing behavior is multidimensional and embedded in social organization and modes of economic production. It uses a modified dictator game varying social distance to the recipient and varying the resource (money vs. six in-kind resources) being shared among the pastoral Maasai of Kenya. Results show that both social distance and the nature of the resource matter for sharing as well as their combination. The discussion argues that these findings are consistent with the nature and role of these resources in the pastoral livelihood among the Maasai. © 2019 The Authors.

Promoting Sustainable Hotel Guest Behavior: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Unsustainable patterns of tourist behavior produce a massive environmental burden. Nevertheless, it is unknown which behavioral strategies can be implemented to foster resource-efficient behavior in customers of leisure and travel services. This article aims to identify and summarize the evidence about the interventions which have been tested to promote sustainable hotel guest behavior. Electronic searches were performed in the main databases from inception to September 2016. Papers deemed eligible for inclusion were experimental field studies, reporting factual changes in guest behavior. The final sample was composed of nine papers comprising 13 studies in a total of 5,859 hotel stays. Results showed that all included interventions targeted towel reuse. Five different types of interventions were identified including environmental appeals, messages prompting commitment for conservation, donation to charity, social norms, and nudges. Only the last two forms of interventions (social norms: effect size [ES] = −0.25, 95% confidence interval [CI] = [−0.39, −0.12], p =.004 and nudges: ES = −0.43, 95% CI = [−0.72, −0.13], p =.009) showed significant positive effects in promoting towel reuse. Particularly regarding social norms, our work shows an effect weaker than reported in previous meta-analyses but consistent (low between-study heterogeneity) in producing modest increases in the levels of towel reuse. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","Nisa, Claudia; Varum, Celeste; Botelho, Anabela",Cornell Hospitality Quarterly,795

Changes in self-perceptions as a result of successfully persuading others,"Can we change other people without changing ourselves as well? To test this question, participants used one of three techniques-door-in-the-face, authoritative influence, and rational arguments - to convince a confederate to attend a campus meeting that favored an issue opposed by the confederate, but supported by the subject. Following the confederate's compliance, participants evaluated their perceptions of their performance and the performance of the confederate. Participants using rational arguments described themselves as intelligent and friendly, participants using authoritative influence described themselves as dominant and unfriendly, and participants using door-in-the-face described themselves as submissive. As predicted from an earlier study (O'Neal, Kipnis, & Craig, 1994), the use of the three influence techniques also caused systematic changes in participants' evaluations of the target. Because the use of certain behavior techniques (e.g., controlling, deceptive) can cause users to devalue themselves and others, it is recommended that ethical safeguards governing the use of these techniques should be considered.","Rind, B.; Kipnis, D.",J.

The eye of the camera: Effects of security cameras on prosocial behavior,"This study addresses the effects of security cameras on prosocial behavior. Results from previous studies indicate that the presence of others can trigger helping behavior, arising from the need for approval of others. Extending these findings, the authors propose that security cameras can likewise trigger such approval-seeking behaviors by implying the presence of a watchful eye. Because people vary in the extent to which they strive for others' approval, it was expected that the effects of security cameras on prosocial behavior vary with participants' need for approval. To test these predictions, an experimental study was conducted with ""presence of security camera"" and ""need for approval"" as independent variables. Results showed that participants indeed offered more help in the presence of a security camera but only to the extent that this helping involved public or observable behavior. As expected, this effect was more pronounced for individuals high in need for approval.

Effects of initial request size and timing of a second request on compliance: The foot in the door and the door in the face,"Tested 4 separate procedures for influencing compliance to the 2nd of 2 requests in a field study. 2 factors, size of initial request and timing of the 2nd request, were included in a 2 × 2 factorial design. The 88 adult Ss were induced either to comply with a small initial request or to refuse a large initial request. They then received a moderate request either immediately (no delay) or 7-10 days later (delay). Compliance to the 2nd request was the dependent measure. A 2nd study was conducted with 60 new Ss to replicate the no-delay and control conditions of the main study. Results in the 2 delay conditions and the small-request-no-delay condition support a self-perception position in that the induction of one kind of behavior (compliance or noncompliance) carried over to affect subsequent behavior similarly. The large-request-no-delay condition. supported a bargaining explanation, as initial refusal to comply led to an increase in subsequent compliance.

More giving or more givers? The effects of tax incentives on charitable donations in the UK,"This paper estimates the effects of tax incentives on charitable contributions in the UK, using the universe of self-assessment income tax returns between 2005 and 2013. We exploit variation from a large reform in 2010 to estimate intensive- and extensive-margin tax-price elasticities of giving. Using a predicted-tax-rate instrument for the price of giving relative to consumption, we find an intensive-margin elasticity of about − 0.2 and an extensive-margin elasticity of − 0.1, yielding a total elasticity of about − 0.3. To further explore the extensive-margin response, we propose a model with a fixed cost of declaring donations and obtain a structural estimate of that cost of around £47.

Population Structure Promotes the Evolution of Intuitive Cooperation and Inhibits Deliberation,"Spatial structure is one of the most studied mechanisms in evolutionary game theory. Here, we explore the consequences of spatial structure for a question which has received considerable empirical and theoretical attention in recent years, but has not yet been studied from a network perspective: whether cooperation relies on intuitive predispositions or deliberative self-control. We examine this question using a model which integrates the ""dual-process"" framework from cognitive science with evolutionary game theory, and considers the evolution of agents who are embedded within a social network and only interact with their neighbors. In line with past work in well-mixed populations, we find that selection favors either the intuitive defector strategy which never deliberates, or the dual-process cooperator strategy which intuitively cooperates but uses deliberation to switch to defection when doing so is payoff-maximizing. We find that sparser networks (i.e., smaller average degree) facilitate the success of dual-process cooperators over intuitive defectors, while also reducing the level of deliberation that dual-process cooperators engage in; and that these results generalize across different kinds of networks. These observations demonstrate the important role that spatial structure can have not just on the evolution of cooperation, but on the co-evolution of cooperation and cognition. © 2018 The Author(s).","Mosleh, M.; Rand, D.G.",Sci.

Putting the long-term into behavior change,"Behavior change is a topic that is of great interest to many people. People can use apps to exercise more, eat healthier, or learn a new skill, but and digital interventions and games are also used by policy makers and companies to create a safe environment for the general public or to increase sales. Given this interest in behavior change, it is not surprising that this topic has seen a lot of interest from the scientific community. This has resulted in a wide range of theories and techniques to bring about behavior change. However, maintaining behavior change is rarely addressed, and as a result poorly understood. In this paper, we take a first step in the design of digital interventions for long-term behavior change by placing a range of behavior change techniques on a long-term behavior change timeline. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","de Weerd, H.; Degens, N.",Lect.

From Altruists to Workers: What Claims Should Healthy Participants in Phase I Trials Have Against Trial Employers?,"Phase I trials, which test the safety and toxicity of an investigational agent, are a vital stage of drug development. Many of these trials enroll healthy participants and recent data suggest that some of the healthy participants treat phase I research participation as a form of work. This chapter examines three facets of the shift from research participation as a form of altruism to research participation as a form of work. First, I set out three features of trial participation that support labeling healthy participants' enrollment in phase I research as a form of work. Second, I ask: is phase I research participation similar to risky occupations such as firefighting or coal mining, or is phase I research participation similar to non-risky, low-wage occupations such as janitorial work? To answer this question, I draw upon original data from a systematic review of 475 phase I trials with healthy participants that measures the risk level of the trials. Third, once I have found the appropriate ``occupational bucket'' for phase I work, I briefly examine the implications for contested questions within research ethics, such as the information persons need prior to consent, rights of withdrawal and compensation for injury, and efforts to increase the transparency of trial results. I argue that conceiving of phase I research as a form of work can bolster the rights of research participants in some of these areas and that bioethicists ought to be less wary of this shift in research participants' roles.","Johnson, Rebecca A",Research Ethics Forum,808
Attentiveness to eyes predicts generosity in a reputation-relevant context,"Eyes play a vital role in human social interactions. In fact, some prior work indicates that simply the presence of eyes or eye-like stimuli increases people's prosocial behavior, arguably because the eyes serve as cues of being watched and thus elicit reputational concerns. The current study was designed to address two questions in this regard. First, we examined how salient the eyes are among the human features. Second, we asked whether individual differences in attentiveness to eyes (but not other human features such as ears or hands) are predictive of reputation-enhancing behavior. Using an eye-tracking paradigm, we found that participants looked longest to eyes compared to other human features. Critically, greater attentiveness to eyes correlated with greater generosity on a donation task, but only in a reputation-relevant context (i.e., when donations were public but not when they were anonymous). Attentiveness to other human features did not predict donation behavior. Eyes are thus an especially salient human feature, and attentiveness to eyes may signal individuals' concerns about their reputations. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Vaish, A.; Kelsey, C.M.; Tripathi, A.; Grossmann, T.",Evol.

The Temporal Effects of Story and Statistical Evidence on Belief Change,"An experiment investigated characteristics of evidence that influenced beliefs across multiple time periods. Respondents, after reading one of four written messages that crossed evidence type (story or statistical) with vividness (vivid or nonvivid), completed belief measures at one of three time intervals (immediate, 48-hour delay, or 1-week delay). Statistical evidence was found to be more persuasive than story evidence. Vivid and nonvivid statistical evidence were persuasive relative to the control at 48 hours, and vivid statistical evidence remained persuasive through 1 week. Neither form of story evidence was persuasive relative to the control at delayed time intervals. © 1994, Sage. All rights reserved.","Baesler, E.J.; Burgoon, J.K.",Commun. Res.,811
Empathic Joy and the Empathy-Altruism Hypothesis,"Three experiments tested whether empathy evokes egoistic motivation to share vicariously in the victim's joy at improvement (the empathic-joy hypothesis) instead of altruistic motivation to increase the victim's welfare (the empathy-altruism hypothesis). In Experiment 1, Ss induced to feel either low or high empathy for a young woman in need were given a chance to help her. Some believed that if they helped they would receive feedback about her improvement; others did not. In Experiments 2 and 3, Ss induced to feel either low or high empathy were given a choice of getting update information about a needy person's condition. Before choosing, they were told the likelihood of the person's condition having improved-and of their experiencing empathic joy-was 20%, was 50%, or was 80%. Results of none of the experiments patterned as predicted by the empathic-joy hypothesis; instead, results of each were consistent with the empathy-altruism hypothesis.","Batson, C.D.; Batson, J.G.; Slingsby, J.K.; Harrell, K.L.; Peekna, H.M.; Todd, R.M.",J.

Random allocation of pies promotes the evolution of fairness in the Ultimatum Game,"In the Ultimatum Game, two players are offered a chance to win a pie. The proposer suggests how to split the pie. The responder can either accept or reject the deal. If an agreement is not reached, neither player gets anything. Both game theory and evolutionary game theory predict the rational solution that the proposer offers the smallest possible share and the responder accepts it. Fairness thus requires additional mechanisms for natural selection to favor it. Studies to date assumed that individuals have competed for the fixed size of pies, in sharp contrast with real situations, where randomness is ubiquitous. Here we study the impact of random allocation of pies on the evolution of fairness in the Ultimatum Game. Interestingly, we find that the evolution of fairness can be promoted by the randomness associated with the size of pies, without the support of any additional evolutionary mechanisms.","Wang, X.; Chen, X.; Wang, L.",Sci.

How does the incentive effect of the charitable deduction vary across charities?,"We examine how taxes affect donations given to nonprofit organizations and how this varies across nonprofit types. Most prior studies constrained tax price elasticities to be constant across nonprofits, primarily because the data do not provide donations by nonprofit type. Using nonprofit-level data and average marginal tax rates that vary across years and states, we estimate tax price elasticities by nonprofit type. We find an aggregate public charity elasticity of approximately-1.0 and a private foundation elasticity of approximately -2.0. These results suggest that the cost of the charitable contribution deduction is roughly proportional to its benefit for public charities, but that the deduction stimulates significant giving for private foundations. When we partition our elasticities across 24 public charity types, we find significant elasticities of-1.0 or larger for six types. This result suggests that the effect of the charitable contribution deduction varies significantly across nonprofit types. © 2013 American Accounting Association.","Yetman, M.H.; Yetman, R.J.",Account.

Why we share our cookies: Prosocial behavior from a psychological perspective,"In order to accomplish the benefits and overcome the difficulties associated with group living, societies critically depend on prosocial behaviors of their members. With various disciplines exploring the preconditions and constraints of altruism and cooperation, psychological research is concerned with the motivations that underlie human prosociality. The present paper summarizes the respective literature, starting out with an overview of the measures most commonly employed to assess prosocial tendencies in the laboratory. In short, psychologists make use of (i) questionnaires in which people rate their own traits, attitudes and behaviors, employ (ii) game theoretical paradigms that aim to enhance objectivity by means of anonymity and real monetary earnings and observe (iii) behavior in controlled, but realistically complex environments. The subsequent section addresses the issue how these measures can be structured and summarizes results of a recent study that categorized the various measurement methods. Specifically, the authors propose a framework of human prosociality that assumes three distinct motivation-based sub-components: Altruistically motivated prosocial behavior reflecting the genuine aim to enhance others’ well-being, norm motivated prosocial behavior referring to the tendency to enforce social norms and self-reported prosocial behavior as the inclination to perceive and describe oneself as a good person. The third section outlines situational and personal factors that influence prosocial behavior, specifically focusing on socio-affective and socio-cognitive facets. This part demonstrates that the proposed sub-components of prosocial behavior are differentially related to some of the personal moderators, for instance to gender, cognitive skills, trait affect and narcissism, which corroborates the framework of distinct aspects of prosociality. Finally, I briefly summarize attempts to enhance prosocial behavior by altering its situational, biological or personal preconditions. The influence of meditation-based trainings has received increasing attention during the last decade, and differential effects of these interventions on the facets of prosociality further support the idea that distinct motivations drive the different behavioral tendencies. © 2019 E.

Dual-process reasoning in charitable giving: Learning from non-results,"To identify dual-process reasoning in giving, we exposed experimental participants making a charitable donation to vivid images of the charity’s beneficiaries in order to stimulate affect. We hypothesized that the effect of an affective manipulation on giving would be larger when we simultaneously put the subjects under cognitive load using a numerical recall task. Independent treatment checks reveal opposite responses in men and women and cast some doubt on the reliability of our mainstream treatment manipulations and assessment tools. We find no evidence for dual-process decision-making, even among women, whose responses to the manipulations conformed most to our expectations. These results highlight the need for caution in the use of these common manipulations, the importance of independent manipulation checks, and the limitations of dual-process models for understanding altruistic behavior. © 2017 by the authors.

The rise of school-supporting nonprofits,"This paper examines voluntary contributions to public education via charitable school foundations, booster clubs, parent teacher associations, and parent teacher organizations. We use panel data on school-supporting charities with national coverage from 1995 to 2010, which we geocode and match to school districts. We document the meteoric rise of school-supporting nonprofits during this panel, and then estimate a series of regression models to examine the distributional consequences of voluntary contributions. We find relatively large districts have higher probabilities of receiving revenues from a school-supporting nonprofit but the level of per-pupil voluntary contributions declines with student enrollment. In addition, we find school districts with higher endowments have higher probabilities of being served by at least one school-supporting nonprofit and higher levels of per-pupil contributions. Finally, we find no evidence that impressive recent growth in the number and financial size of these school-supporting charities relates to reductions in the public financing of schools. © 2014 Association for Education Finance and Policy.","Nelson, A.A.; Gazley, B.",Educ.

Social observation increases deontological judgments in moral dilemmas,"A concern for positive reputation is one of the core motivations underlying various social behaviors in humans. The present study investigated how experimentally induced reputation concern modulates judgments in moral dilemmas. In a mixed-design experiment, participants were randomly assigned to the observed vs. the control group and responded to a series of trolley-type moral dilemmas either in the presence or absence of observers, respectively. While no significant baseline difference in personality traits and moral decision tendency were found across two groups of participants, our analyses revealed that social observation promoted deontological judgments especially for moral dilemmas involving direct bodily harm (i.e., personal moral dilemmas), yet with an overall decrease in decision confidence and significant prolongation of reaction time. Moreover, participants in the observed group, but not in the control group, showed the increased sensitivities towards warmth vs. competence traits words in the lexical decision task performed after the moral dilemma task. Our findings suggest that reputation concern, once triggered by the presence of potentially judgmental others, could activate a culturally dominant norm of warmth in various social contexts. This could, in turn, induce a series of goal-directed processes for self-presentation of warmth, leading to increased deontological judgments in moral dilemmas. The results of the present study provide insights into the reputational consequences of moral decisions that merit further exploration. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Lee, M.; Sul, S.; Kim, H.",Evol. Hum.

Intelligent people defect more in a one-shot prisoner's dilemma game,"Why so many people make the theoretically irrational decision to cooperate in a one-shot Prisoner's Dilemma game remains a puzzle in game theory. Recent developments in evolutionary psychology suggest that the anomaly may be attributable to evolutionary constraints on the human brain and their interaction with general intelligence. We conduct a laboratory experiment to test three hypotheses: (a) projection of a video image of another experimental subject increases cooperation because the human brain implicitly assumes that their choice is not anonymous; (b) more intelligent individuals are more likely to defect, because they are more likely to comprehend the evolutionarily novel features of the experiment that make defection rational; and (c) the effect of the video projection on cooperation is greater among less intelligent individuals. The experiment clearly supports two of the three hypotheses.","Kanazawa, S.; Fontaine, L.",J. Neurosci. Psychol. Econ.,821
How to Attract Donations: The Case of US NGOs in International Development,"We assess the determinants of private donations across a large sample of US based NGOs with foreign aid activities.

Private donors rather rely on the frequently offered option to designate donations to preferred purposes - even though this is unlikely to tie the NGOs' hands. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Nunnenkamp, P.; Öhler, H.",J.

Scope insensitivity in helping decisions: Is it a matter of culture and values?,"The singularity effect of identifiable victims refers to people's greater willingness to help a single concrete victim compared with a group of victims experiencing the same need. We present 3 studies exploring values and cultural sources of this effect. In the first study, the singularity effect was found only among Western Israelis and not among Bedouin participants (a more collectivist group). In Study 2, individuals with higher collectivist values were more likely to contribute to a group of victims. Finally, the third study demonstrates a more causal relationship between collectivist values and the singularity effect by showing that enhancing people's collectivist values using a priming manipulation produces similar donations to single victims and groups. Moreover, participants' collectivist preferences mediated the interaction between the priming conditions and singularity of the recipient.

"Resistance to extreme strategies, rather than prosocial preferences, can explain human cooperation in public goods games","The results of numerous economic games suggest that humans behave more cooperatively than would be expected if they were maximizing selfish interests. It has been argued that this is because individuals gain satisfaction from the success of others, and that such prosocial preferences require a novel evolutionary explanation. However, in previous games, imperfect behavior would automatically lead to an increase in cooperation, making it impossible to decouple any form of mistake or error from prosocial cooperative decisions. Here we empirically test between these alternatives by decoupling imperfect behavior from prosocial preferences in modified versions of the public goods game, in which individuals would maximize their selfish gain by completely (100%) cooperating. We found that, although this led to higher levels of cooperation, it did not lead to full cooperation, and individuals still perceived their group mates as competitors. This is inconsistent with either selfish or prosocial preferences, suggesting that the most parsimonious explanation is imperfect behavior triggered by psychological drives that can prevent both complete defection and complete cooperation. More generally, our results illustrate the caution that must be exercised when interpreting the evolutionary implications of economic experiments, especially the absolute level of cooperation in a particular treatment.","Kümmerli, R.; Burton-Chellew, M.N.; Ross-Gillespie, A.; West, S.A.",Proc.

Overall evaluation of economic theories,"This article evaluates economic theories of the non-profit sector by their ability to enlighten our understanding of the scope of inquiry, the determinants of the size and scope of the non-profit sector, and the behavioural responses of donors, volunteers, paid staff and non-profit organisations to changes in their external environment. Adherence to a non-distribution constraint has proven to be a useful way of delimiting economic analysis of non-profit organisations, but more attention should be paid to alternatives. Economists have been less successful at developing usable distinctions between voluntary action and exchange. The size and scope of the sector appear to be determined by entrepreneurial supply factors, donations (which in turn are influenced by tax policy, governmental spending, fund-raising, and the quality and mixture of organisational outputs, commercial or charitable), commercial activities, capital supply, the supply of labour (paid and volunteered), the marketability of outputs, and the distribution of consumer characteristics. Variations of James's (1983) model have proven useful to predict the reaction of non-profits to exogenous changes.","Steinberg, R.",Voluntas,828
The relationship between the entrepreneurial personality and the Big Five personality traits,"Although meta-analyses show that the Big Five personality traits predict business intention, creation, and success (Brandstätter, 2011), they also indicate that narrow personality traits, such as innovativeness, predict these outcomes better than broad traits, such as Conscientiousness and Extraversion (Rauch & Frese, 2007). The current study extends previous research to examine the relationship between the Big Five and a wider range of entrepreneurial outcomes (e.g. founding charitable organisations, organising events, and changing organisational practices). Additionally, it establishes the incremental validity of a narrow measure of entrepreneurial personality over the Big Five (META, Ahmetoglu, Leutner, & Chamorro-Premuic, 2011). Both the Big Five and META significantly predict various forms of entrepreneurial success, though META does so more consistently. This suggests that narrow personality traits have incremental validity in predicting entrepreneurial success vis-à-vis the Big Five. Theoretical and applied implications are discussed.

This research uses a number of model specifications and estimating techniques to appropriately capture the relationship between government grants and private donations. Under alternative specifications, the relationship between government grants and private donations suggests crowding-in between $0.14 and $1.15. The crowd-in relationship does change according to art type: symphony orchestras and music companies experience a modest crowd-in while dance and ballet companies experience a small crowd-out. Although the crowd-in falls to zero under the strictest condition, there is a lack of evidence of crowd-out for nonprofit performing arts organizations as a group. © 2007 The Authors.

Reluctance to vaccinate: Omission bias and ambiguity,"Subjects are reluctant to vaccinate a (hypothetical) child when the vaccination itself can cause death, even when this is much less likely than death from the disease prevented. This effect is even greater when there is a ‘risk group’ for death (with its overall probability held constant), even though the test for membership in the risk group is unavailable. This effect cannot be explained in terms of a tendency to assume that the child is in the risk group. A risk group for death from the disease has no effect on reluctance to vaccinate. The reluctance is an example of omission bias (Spranca, Minsk & Baron, in press), an overgeneralization of a distinction between commissions and omissions to a case in which it is irrelevant. Likewise, it would ordinarily be prudent to find out whether a child is in a risk group before acting, but in this case it is impossible, so knowledge of the existence of the risk group is irrelevant. The risk‐group effect is consistent with Frisch & Baron's (1988) interpretation of ambiguity. Copyright © 1990 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Ritov, I.; Baron, J.",J. Behav. Decis. Mak.,831

They further argue that when it is easy to manipulate a proposed psychological process but difficult to measure it that designs that examine underlying process by utilizing moderation can be effective. It is only when measurement of a proposed psychological process is easy and manipulation of it is difficult that designs that rely on mediational analyses should be preferred, and even in these situations careful consideration should be given to the limiting factors of such designs.

Machine perfusion versus cold storage of kidneys derived from donation after cardiac death: a meta-analysis,"BACKGROUND: In response to the increased organ shortage, organs derived from donation after cardiac death (DCD) donors are becoming an acceptable option once again for clinical use in transplantation. However, transplant outcomes in cases where DCD organs are used are not as favorable as those from donation after brain death or living donors. Different methods of organ preservation are a key factor that may influence the outcomes of DCD kidney transplantation. METHODS: We compared the transplant outcomes in patients receiving DCD kidneys preserved by machine perfusion (MP) or by static cold storage (CS) preservation by conducting a meta-analysis. The MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Library databases were searched. All studies reporting outcomes for MP versus CS preserved DCD kidneys were further considered for inclusion in this meta-analysis. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated to compare the pooled data between groups that were transplanted with kidneys that were preserved by MP or CS. RESULTS: Four prospective, randomized, controlled trials, involving 175 MP and 176 CS preserved DCD kidney transplant recipients, were included. MP preserved DCD kidney transplant recipients had a decreased incidence of delayed graft function (DGF) with an odd ration of 0.56 (95% CI = 0.36-0.86, P = 0.008) compared to CS. However, no significant differences were seen between the two technologies in incidence of primary non-function, one year graft survival, or one year patient survival. CONCLUSIONS: MP preservation of DCD kidneys is superior to CS in terms of reducing DGF rate post-transplant. However, primary non-function, one year graft survival, and one year patient survival were not affected by the use of MP or CS for preservation.","Deng, Ronghai; Gu, Guangxiang; Wang, Dongping; Tai, Qiang; Wu, Linwei; Ju, Weiqiang; Zhu, Xiaofeng; Guo, Zhiyong; He, Xiaoshun",PLoS One,834
Extending the simple linear regression model to account for correlated responses: An introduction to generalized estimating equations and multi-level mixed modelling,"Much of the research in epidemiology and clinical science is based upon longitudinal designs which involve repeated measurements of a variable of interest in each of a series of individuals. Such designs can be very powerful, both statistically and scientifically, because they enable one to study changes within individual subjects over time or under varied conditions. However, this power arises because the repeated measurements tend to be correlated with one another, and this must be taken into proper account at the time of analysis or misleading conclusions may result. Recent advances in statistical theory and in software development mean that studies based upon such designs can now be analysed more easily, in a valid yet flexible manner, using a variety of approaches which include the use of generalized estimating equations, and mixed models which incorporate random effects. This paper provides a particularly simple illustration of the use of these two approaches, taking as a practical example the analysis of a study which examined the response of portable peak expiratory flow meters to changes in true peak expiratory flow in 12 children with asthma. The paper takes the reader through the relevant practicalities of model fitting, interpretation and criticism and demonstrates that, in a simple case such as this, analyses based upon these model-based approaches produce reassuringly similar inferences to standard analyses based upon more conventional methods.","Burton, P.; Gurrin, L.; Sly, P.",Stat.

Does narrative information bias individual's decision making? A systematic review,"Although it seemed likely that narrative information affected individuals' decision making processes and outcomes, it was unclear why narratives affected the decision making process, whether they facilitated or biased decision making and whether they affected the quality and/or outcome of the decision. XCM: The search question was broad but clear. The search strategy was extensive and attempts were made to identify unpublished data. The restriction to English-language articles meant that the results may have been affected by language bias. It was unclear how many reviewers performed the study selection and data extraction, so errors or bias may have been introduced during the review process. A validity assessment was conducted, although reporting of this indicated that it may have been rather subjective and no details were given on how it was performed. The narrative synthesis was appropriate.Some aspects of the review process are not well reported, but the authors'conclusions are suitably cautious and reflect the limited evidence presented. XIM: Practice: The authors suggested that people who designing interventions to facilitate informed decision making avoid use of patient testimonials until there was evidence to explain what type of narrative encouraged bias in information processing and decision making and which mechanisms mediated the effect.Research: The authors stated that studies should aim to strengthen validity by using non-student or patient populationa and/or scenariosinformed by current health practice. The quality of research could also be improved by explicit reporting of the sampling procedure and inclusion of validated measures. Further research is also needed to examine the impact of including different narrative types in hypothetical scenarios.","Winterbottom, A; Bekker, H L; Conner, M; Mooney, A",,836

The effects of psychosocial stress on intergroup resource allocation,"Stress changes our social behavior. Traditionally, stress has been associated with “fight-or-flight” – the tendency to attack an aggressor, or escape the stressor. But stress may also promote the opposite pattern, i.e., “tend-and-befriend” – increased prosociality toward others. It is currently unclear which situational or physiological factors promote one or the other. Here, we hypothesized that stress stimulates both tendencies, but that fight-or-flight is primarily directed against a potentially hostile outgroup, moderated by rapid-acting catecholamines, while tend-and-befriend is mainly shown towards a supportive ingroup, regulated by cortisol. To test this hypothesis, we measured stress-related neurohormonal modulators and sex hormones in male and female participants who were exposed to a psychosocial stressor, and subsequently played an intergroup social dilemma game in which they could reveal prosocial motives towards an ingroup (ingroup-love) and hostility towards an outgroup (outgroup-hate). We found no significant effects of stress on social preferences, but stress-related heart-rate increases predicted outgroup-hostile behavior. Furthermore, when controlling for testosterone, cortisol was associated with increased ingroup-love. Other-regarding behavior was overall higher in male than female participants. Our mixed results are of interest to scholars of the effects of stress on prosocial and aggressive behavior, but call for refinement in future replications. © 2019, The Author(s).","Schweda, A.; Faber, N.S.; Crockett, M.J.; Kalenscher, T.",Sci.

The Influence of Nietzsche on Freud's Ideas,"Background. The striking analogies between the ideas of Freud and Friedrich Nietzsche, whose works were published from one to three decades before those of Freud, have been commented upon, but no previous systematic correlation of the ideas of Nietzsche and Freud has been made. Method. The major works of Nietzsche were read, and each possible analogy to an idea later broached by Freud was correlated by a systematic review of his works. Any references to Nietzsche in Freud's writings and reported conversation were culled. Results. Concepts of Nietzsche which are similar to those of Freud include (a) the concept of the unconscious mind; (b) the idea that repression pushes unacceptable feelings and thoughts into the unconscious and thus makes the individual emotionally more comfortable and effective; (c) the conception that repressed emotions and instinctual drives rater are expressed in disguised ways (for example, hostile feelings and ideas may be expressed as altruistic sentiments and acts); (d) the concept of dreams as complex, symbolic `'illusions of illusions'' and dreaming itself as a cathartic process which has healthy properties; and (e) the suggestion that the projection of hostile, unconscious feelings onto others, who are then perceived as persecutors of the individual, is the basis of paranoid thinking. Some of Freud's basic terms are identical to those used by Nietzsche. Conclusion. Freud repeatedly stated that he had never read Nietzsche. Evidence contradicting this are his references to Nietzsche and his quotations and paraphrases of him, in casual conversation and his now published personal correspondence, as well as in his early and later writings.","Chapman, A H; Chapman-Santana, Mirian",Br.

Image induction and social influence: Explication and initial tests,"Image induction posits that social influencers can manipulate a target's self-image to gain increased compliance. By preceding a request with a question that creates a salient self-image in a target, targets are more likely to behave consistently with that image by complying with the request. Three studies provide empirical tests of image induction. Results indicate that the addition of an image-inducing pretreatment question is associated with increased rates of compliance when compared to a control group. These findings held across two types of image induction manipulations (helpfulness, willingness to try new things), two types of behaviors (agreeing to complete a survey, agreeing to receive a free soft drink sample), and both face-to-face and written requests. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Bolkan, S.; Andersen, P.A.",Basic Appl.

What Kind of Information About Marginal Donors Is Available Through Sources Other Than Health Care Professionals for Patients on the Waiting List for Organ Transplantation?,"BACKGROUND: The current organ shortage has necessitated expanding the criteria for potential donations to marginal donors (older or sick donors whose organs would have been considered unsuitable before). In France, physicians are not required to provide information to recipients about marginal donors except for hepatitis C or hepatitis B infection and non-heart-beating donations. We hypothesized that patients can be informed about these risks by other information sources than health care professionals, such as websites and patient associations. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of the study were to identify the main health information sources of transplant patients other than health professionals and to evaluate the information provided by websites and associations to patients about the risks of transplantation from marginal donors. METHODS: In this study, the information sources for kidney, liver, heart, and lung patients that had already received transplants or registered on waiting lists were identified by a survey in four transplant centers. Further, the information proposed by French and English language websites and patient associations were evaluated, respectively, by a systematic review of websites and a survey among the presidents of kidney, liver, heart, and lung patient associations. RESULTS: For the first survey, (367/402) 91.3% responses were registered. Apart from health professionals identified as the principal information source (363/367) 98.9%, 19 liver and 28 heart patients searched for information on the websites, while 37 kidney and 42 lung patients were more informed by patients' associations. Our two last surveys showed that information about marginal donors is accessible by websites and (10/34) 30% of associations. All of the 60 Internet documents evaluated on French language and English language websites proposed information about marginal donors. Otherwise, (52/65) 80% of these documents were dedicated to health professionals and contained specialized information, difficult to understand by patients. Certain associations, (20/34) 59%, provided information about the risks of transplantation. There were 45/115 patients considering associations as their main information source that were informed by an association's website. However, only (5/22) 23% of associations communicated the risks of transplantation with patients through their websites. CONCLUSIONS: Currently, patients want to be more informed by other information sources than health professionals, particularly by the websites. Nevertheless, they cannot always trust information proposed by these sources. They need to have their physicians inform them about specialized keywords and present them with reliable information sources. So reliable centers such as universities, transplant centers, and associations should develop the quality and quantity of information proposed to patients on their websites.","Kamran, Sara; Calmus, Yvon; Pomey, Marie Pascale; Vidal-Trécan, Gwenaëlle",Interact.

Effectiveness of Error Management Training: A Meta-Analysis,"Error management training (EMT) is a training method that involves active exploration as well as explicit encouragement for learners to make errors during training and to learn from them. Past evaluation studies, which compared skill-based training outcomes of EMT with those of proceduralized error-avoidant training or of exploratory training without error encouragement, have yielded considerable variation in effect sizes. The present meta-analysis compiles the results of the existing studies and seeks to explain this variation. Although the mean effect of EMT across all 24 identified studies (N = 2,183) was positive and significant (Cohen's d = 0.44), there were several moderators. Moderator analyses showed effect sizes to be larger (a) for posttraining transfer (d = 0.56) than for within-training performance and (b) for performance tasks that were structurally distinct (adaptive transfer; d = 0.80) than for tasks that were similar to training (analogical transfer). In addition, both active exploration and error encouragement were identified as effective elements in EMT. Results suggest that EMT may be better suited than error-avoidant training methods for promotion of transfer to novel tasks. © 2008 American Psychological Association.","Keith, N.; Frese, M.",J.

The social neuroscience of reputation,"Human behavior is strongly influenced by the presence of others. Obtaining a good reputation or avoiding a bad one is a powerful incentive for a plethora of human actions. Theoretical considerations suggest that reputation may be a key mediator of aspects of altruistic behavior that are uniquely human. Despite its considerable influence on human social behavior and the growing interest in social neuroscience, investigations of the neural basis of reputation-based decision-making are still in their infancy. Here, I argue that reputation is an important aspect of human social cognition and present some of the candidate neural mechanisms. © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd and the Japan Neuroscience Society.","Izuma, K.",Neurosci.

Looking Under the Hood of Third-Party Punishment Reveals Design for Personal Benefit,"Third-party intervention, such as when a crowd stops a mugger, is common. Yet it seems irrational because it has real costs but may provide no personal benefits. In a laboratory analogue, the third-party-punishment game, third parties (“punishers”) will often spend real money to anonymously punish bad behavior directed at other people. A common explanation is that third-party punishment exists to maintain a cooperative society. We tested a different explanation: Third-party punishment results from a deterrence psychology for defending personal interests. Because humans evolved in small-scale, face-to-face social worlds, the mind infers that mistreatment of a third party predicts later mistreatment of oneself. We showed that when punishers do not have information about how they personally will be treated, they infer that mistreatment of other people predicts mistreatment of themselves, and these inferences predict punishment. But when information about personal mistreatment is available, it drives punishment. This suggests that humans’ punitive psychology evolved to defend personal interests. © The Author(s) 2016.","Krasnow, M.M.; Delton, A.W.; Cosmides, L.; Tooby, J.",Psychol. Sci.,853
Reaching substantive female representation among decision-makers: A qualitative research study of gender-related experiences from the health sector in Mozambique,"Background Achieving significant female representation in government at decision-making levels has been identified as a key step towards achieving gender equality. In 2015, women held 39.6% of parliamentary seats in Mozambique, which is above the benchmark of 30% that has been suggested as the turning point for minority representation to move from token status to having a sizable impact. We undertook a study to identify gender-related barriers and facilitators to improving women-centered policies in the health sector. Methods We conducted in-depth interviews with 39 individuals (32 women, 7 men) involved at a senior level in policy making or implementation of woman-centric policies within the Mozambique Ministry of Health and affiliated institutions. We used a semi-structured interview guide that included questions on difficulties and facilitating factors encountered in the policy making process, and the perceived role of gender in this process. We used both deductive and inductive analysis approaches, starting with a set of pre-identified themes and expanding this to include themes that emerged during coding. Results Our data suggest two main findings: (1) the women who participated in our study generally do not report feeling discrimination in the workplace and (2) senior health sector perceive women to be more personally attuned to women-centric issues than men. Within our specific sample, we found little to suggest that gender discrimination is a problem professionally for female decision-makers in Mozambique. However, these findings should be contextualized using an intersectional lens with recognition of the important difference between descriptive versus substantive female representation, and whether “percentage of women” is truly the best metric for gaging commitment to gender equality at the policy making level. Conclusions Mozambique’s longstanding significant representation of women may have led to creating an environment that leads to positive experiences for female decision-makers in the government. However, while the current level of female representation should be celebrated, it does not negate the need for continued focus on female representation in decision-making positions. © 2018 Sawadogo-Lewis et al.

The Scarecrow and the Tin Man: The Vicissitudes of Human Sympathy and Caring,"Why do some victims elicit outpourings of sympathy from those who are unaffected, while others do not? The authors propose a theoretical framework for making sense of the vicissitudes of sympathy based on the interaction between two qualitatively different mental processes. One, which the authors term ""sympathy,"" is caring but immature and irrational. The other process, which the authors term ""deliberation,"" is rational but uncaring. After proposing a framework for how these two factors interact, the authors first discuss a variety of factors that affect the strength of sympathy, including whether one is in the same state as the victim, one's past and vicarious experiences, proximity, similarity, vividness, and newness. Next, the authors discuss factors that affect the relative influence of deliberation. The framework helps to integrate a wide range of disparate experimental findings and provides a possible resolution to parallel debates taking place in psychology and economics over the nature of altruism. © 2007 American Psychological Association.","Loewenstein, G.; Small, D.A.",Rev.

Applications of continuous improvement methodologies in the voluntary sector: a systematic literature review,"Despite the vast acceptance of continuous improvement (CI) methodologies in manufacturing and services industries, few organisations have implemented CI in the voluntary sector (VS). This paper presents a systematic review of the literature on CI methodologies in VS. 20 publications on the application of CI methodologies in VS were included drawn from four academic databases (EBSCOHost, Emerald Insight, Web of Science and Scopus). The review was restricted to peer-reviewed English-written academic articles published between 2000 and 2017. The findings revealed that cost reduction, increased customer satisfaction and improved staff empowerment are some of the potential benefits of implementing CI in the VS. Further, the possible challenges include resistance to change, lack of formal processes and the diversity of customers. This review underlines the critical success factors for the adoption of CI methodologies as appropriate leadership and organisational culture and staff engagement. Additionally, the paper identifies emerging trends and research gaps in this area. The findings of the study will enable VS professionals to gain a better understanding of the application of CI methodologies and will allow academics to conduct further research in this area using the identified research gaps.","Jevanesan, Thivya; Antony, Jiju; Rodgers, Bryan; Prashar, Anupama",Total Qual.

How Social an Animal? The Human Capacity for Caring,"We live in a social arena. Yet, in our interactions with others do we ever really care about them, or is the real target of our concern always, exclusively ourselves? For many years psychology, including social psychology, has assumed that we are social egoists, caring exclusively for ourselves. Today, the computer analogy that underlies so much thinking in cognitive and social psychology overlooks the fact that we care altogether. Recent evidence in support of the empathy-altruism hypothesis suggests a very different view. It suggests that not only do we care but also that when we feel empathy for others in need, we are capable of caring for them for their sakes and not our own. Limits on the human capacity for altruistic caring are discussed.","Batson, C.D.",Am. Psychol.,857
Founders' fortunes and philanthropy: A history of the U.S. Charitable-contribution deduction,"Since 1917, tax filers in the United States who itemize tax deductions have been able to subtract gifts to eligible charities from their taxable income. The deduction is especially valuable to successful entrepreneurs who donate corporate stock. Such philanthropy was seen as a close substitute for government spending until after the mid-twentieth century. In the 1950s and 1960s, high tax rates catalyzed the formation of large foundations from industrial fortunes and precipitated a national debate about the legitimacy of such giving. The midcentury debate preceded increased oversight of charities and foundations and a shift in the way U.S. lawmakers regarded the contribution deduction - from a subsidy by philanthropists of public goods government would otherwise provide to an implicit public cost. © 2019 The President and Fellows of Harvard College.","Duquette, N.J.",Bus.

Rebate versus matching: Does how we subsidize charitable contributions matter?,"A rebate subsidy of rate sr is functionally equivalent to a matching subsidy of rate sm=sr/ (1-sr). Other things equal, an individual should respond identically to the two subsidies. We test the effect on charitable giving of the framing of a subsidy as a rebate or as a match. Subjects make a series of 'dictator' allocation decisions, dividing an endowment between themselves and their chosen charities. Allocation decisions vary by the endowment level, the net price of giving, and the form of the subsidy. We find that contributions are significantly higher with matching subsidies than with rebate subsidies. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.","Eckel, C.C.; Grossman, P.J.",J.

The impact of the National Endowment for the Arts in the United States: Institutional and sectoral effects on private funding,This paper examines the impact of the National Endowment for the Arts on private donations to the arts. The aim of the analysis is to assess whether public funding generates a crowding effect on private giving. We distinguish between institutional and sectoral crowding phenomena and discuss their possible implications. We used both a qualitative approach and an econometric model to estimate the effect of NEA introduction and appropriations on donations. Our results suggest that at the institutional level NEA grants do not generally induce donations to recipients while at the sectoral level appropriations and private giving are independent. The introduction of the agency appears to have caused a decrease in donations. © 2004 Kluwer Academic Publishers.,"Borgonovi, F.; O'Hare, M.",J. Cult. Econ.,861
Accuracy of cervical transvaginal sonography in predicting preterm birth: a systematic review,"Both cervical length and funneling, either alone or in combination, can help in predicting spontaneous pre-term birth in asymptomatic women. There were limited data on symptomatic women, but the findings showed that funneling appeared to predict spontaneous pre-term birth. XCM: The review question was clear in terms of the study design, test and reference standard, and participants. Several relevant sources were searched and no language restrictions were applied. Two reviewers independently selected English language publications and this reduced the potential for bias and errors. However, the methods used to assess quality and extract the data were not described; hence, any efforts made to reduce errors and bias cannot be judged. Quality was assessed using established criteria and the results were reported.Adequate information on the included studies was tabulated and appropriate statistical methods were used to synthesise the data. Various subgroup analyses were undertaken and the results for high-quality studies were analysed separately. The authors discussed some of the limitations of the review, such as the need for caution when interpreting LRs in the presence of heterogeneity and the limited power due to the small number of studies within each subgroup; many subgroups only contained one study. The authors' general conclusions are likely to be reliable. However, as the authors pointed out, the usefulness of cervical length measurement and funneling depends upon the method chosen to define the abnormality. Furthermore the clinical heterogeneity among the included studies must be borne in mind. XIM: Practice: The authors stated that with the provision of individual threshold estimates stratified according to common testing gestational ages, clinicians should be able to use the more realistic probabilities presented in the review to predict spontaneous pre-term birth.Research: The authors did not state any implications for further research.","Honest, H; Bachmann, L M; Coomarasamy, A; Gupta, J K; Kleijnen, J; Khan, K S",,862
PERSPECTIVES: Mental Health Policy in India: Seven Sets of Questions and Some Answers,"BACKGROUND: This paper frames the state of mental health policy in India in terms of seven sets of questions, and seeks to provide at least partial answers to these questions, based on a meta-analysis of existing research. The context of the analysis is the arguably poor state of mental health care in India, as well as an unprecedented level of policy attention to the issue. AIMS OF THE STUDY: In brief, the questions we pose pertain to (i) the provision of such care in hospitals, (ii) non-hospital provision, including by non-medical providers, (iii) issues of education and social acceptance, (iv) affordability, (v) within-country variation of care and possibilities for benchmarking, (vi) aggregate resource impacts of a concerted effort to change policies and improve care, and (vii) the shape of a more effective ""continuum of care"" for mental health issues. METHODS: Given the complexity of the subject, this paper is meant to serve as a framing of issues for further research, but in doing so, to clarify what issues are most pressing, those that are most difficult and perhaps those that can be tackled more readily, to create some momentum in changing the relatively poor state of mental health care in India. RESULTS: While new laws and policies being introduced in India propose ideas and changes that are groundbreaking for that country, leading to cautious optimism, there still are many gaps in the understanding of the challenges of the provision of increased access to, as well as better quality, mental health care in India. These challenges can be understood on two fronts: one is the psychiatric and medical aspect of the issues, and the other is the management and administration of the system. DISCUSSION: Perhaps the highest priority in achieving the goals of greater access and better quality is to increase the number of trained personnel at all levels of specialization and skilling that are relevant. Further, while the new legal framework and policy identify the importance of information technology in rapid expansion of access to mental healthcare, more context-specific research and trials are needed. With respect to the administration and management needs of the public system, important challenges will be the need for significant organizational innovations in the education system, and cultural changes that allow specialized medical professionals to accept the use of software and less-qualified, more dispersed, frontline providers. A final area is the interface between the public and private sectors, including the role of non-profit organizations: challenges include information sharing, division of responsibilities, and resource allocation. IMPLICATIONS FOR HEALTH CARE PROVISION AND USE: Our analysis suggests that incorporating information technology, along with training professionals at a variety of skill levels in its use, may provide a resource-feasible approach to improving access to mental healthcare at reasonable cost and quality in the Indian context. IMPLICATIONS FOR HEALTH POLICIES: India's mental health policies are already undergoing major changes, and our analysis emphasizes the need for translating these generic policies into specific and implementable versions that can be tested at the local level across different regional and social contexts in India. IMPLICATIONS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH: The overall challenge is daunting, being the need to expand access and improve quality, while still managing costs, all within an overall healthcare system that is itself struggling to achieve these goals. Further research based on piloting and trials of assistive software and training programs will likely be useful.","Mirza, Arshad; Singh, Nirvikar",J. Ment. Health Policy Econ.,863

Why the Door-in-the-Face Technique Can Sometimes Backfire: A Construal-Level Account,"We put forward a construal-level account to explain why the door-in-the-face (DITF) technique can sometimes backfire in the prosocial domain. We argue that after rejecting an initial prosocial request, more abstract construals promote a more coherent selfish version of the self in people's minds, which then fosters less compliance with subsequent requests. Across three experiments, results indicated that relative to an outright request, the DITF technique was less likely to get participants to comply with various prosocial requests (e.g., writing to sick children) when participants adopted more abstract construals.

Watching eyes on potential litter can reduce littering: Evidence fromtwo field experiments,"Littering constitutes a major societal problem, and any simple intervention that reduces its prevalence would be widely beneficial. In previous research, we have found that displaying images of watching eyes in the environment makes people less likely to litter. Here, we investigate whether the watching eyes images can be transferred onto the potential items of litter themselves. In two field experiments on a university campus, we created an opportunity to litter by attaching leaflets that either did or did not feature an image of watching eyes to parked bicycles. In both experiments, the watching eyes leaflets were substantially less likely to be littered than control leaflets (odds ratios 0.22-0.32). We also found that people were less likely to litter when there other people in the immediate vicinity than when there were not (odds ratios 0.04-0.25) and, in one experiment but not the other, that eye leaflets only reduced littering when there no other people in the immediate vicinity. We suggest that designing cues of observation into packaging could be a simple but fruitful strategy for reducing littering. © 2015 Bateson et al.","Bateson, M.; Robinson, R.; Abayomi-Cole, T.; Greenlees, J.; O'Connor, A.; Nettle, D.",PeerJ,867

Extracorporeal resuscitation for refractory out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in adults: A systematic review of international practices and outcomes,"AIM: Extracorporeal resuscitation during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) deploys rapid cardiopulmonary bypass to sustain oxygenated circulation until the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). The purpose of this systematic review is to address the defining elements and outcomes (quality survival and organ donation) of currently active protocols for ECPR in refractory out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) of cardiac origin in adult patients. The results may inform policy and practices for ECPR and help clarify the corrresponding intersection with deceased organ donation. METHODS: We searched Medline, Embase, Cochrane and seven other electronic databases from 2005 to 2015, with no language restrictions. Internal validity and the quality of the studies reporting outcomes and guidelines were assessed. The review was included in the international prospective register of systematic reviews (Prospero, CRD42014015259). RESULTS: One guideline and 20 outcome studies were analyzed. Half of the studies were prospective observational studies assessed to be of fair to good methodological quality. The remainder were retrospective cohorts, case series, and case studies. Ages ranged from 16 to 75 years and initial shockable cardiac rhythms, witnessed events, and a reversible primary cause of cardiac arrest were considered favorable prognostic factors. CPR duration and time to hospital cannulation varied considerably. Coronary revascularization, hemodynamic interventions and targeted temperature management neuroprotection were variable. A total of 833 patients receiving this ECPR approach had an overall reported survival rate of 22%, including 13% with good neurological recovery. Additionally, 88 potential and 17 actual deceased organ donors were identified among the non-survivor population in 8 out of 20 included studies. Study heterogeneity precluded a meta-analysis preventing any meaningful comparison between protocols, interventions and outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: ECPR is feasible for refractory OHCA of cardiac origin in adult patients. It may enable neurologically good survival in selected patients, who practically have no other alternative in order to save their lives with quality of life, and contribute to organ donation in those who die. Large, prospective studies are required to clarify patient selection, modifiable outcome variables, risk-benefit and cost-effectiveness.","Ortega-Deballon, Iván; Hornby, Laura; Shemie, Sam D; Bhanji, Farhan; Guadagno, Elena",Resuscitation,870

Interrater reliability: The kappa statistic,"The kappa statistic is frequently used to test interrater reliability. The importance of rater reliability lies in the fact that it represents the extent to which the data collected in the study are correct representations of the variables measured. Measurement of the extent to which data collectors (raters) assign the same score to the same variable is called interrater reliability. While there have been a variety of methods to measure interrater reliability, traditionally it was measured as percent agreement, calculated as the number of agreement scores divided by the total number of scores. In 1960, Jacob Cohen critiqued use of percent agreement due to its inability to account for chance agreement. He introduced the Cohen's kappa, developed to account for the possibility that raters actually guess on at least some variables due to uncertainty. Like most correlation statistics, the kappa can range from -1 to +1. While the kappa is one of the most commonly used statistics to test interrater reliability, it has limitations. Judgments about what level of kappa should be acceptable for health research are questioned. Cohen's suggested interpretation may be too lenient for health related studies because it implies that a score as low as 0.41 might be acceptable. Kappa and percent agreement are compared, and levels for both kappa and percent agreement that should be demanded in healthcare studies are suggested.","McHugh, M.L.",Biochem Med.,872
Humans expect generosity,"Mechanisms supporting human ultra-cooperativeness are very much subject to debate. One psychological feature likely to be relevant is the formation of expectations, particularly about receiving cooperative or generous behavior from others. Without such expectations, social life will be seriously impeded and, in turn, expectations leading to satisfactory interactions can become norms and institutionalize cooperation. In this paper, we assess people's expectations of generosity in a series of controlled experiments using the dictator game. Despite differences in respective roles, involvement in the game, degree of social distance or variation of stakes, the results are conclusive: subjects seldom predict that dictators will behave selfishly (by choosing the Nash equilibrium action, namely giving nothing). The majority of subjects expect that dictators will choose the equal split. This implies that generous behavior is not only observed in the lab, but also expected by subjects. In addition, expectations are accurate, matching closely the donations observed and showing that as a society we have a good grasp of how we interact. Finally, correlation between expectations and actual behavior suggests that expectations can be an important ingredient of generous or cooperative behavior. © 2017 The Author(s).","Brañas-Garza, P.; Rodríguez-Lara, I.; Sánchez, A.",Sci.

Electrophysiological studies of face perception in humans,"Event-related potentials (ERPs) associated with face perception were recorded with scalp electrodes from normal volunteers. Subjects performed a visual target detection task in which they mentally counted the number of occurrences of pictorial stimuli from a designated category such as butterflies. In separate experiments, target stimuli were embedded within a series of other stimuli including unfamiliar human faces and isolated face components, inverted faces, distorted faces, animal faces, and other nonface stimuli. Human faces evoked a negative potential at 172 msec (N170), which was absent from the ERPs elicited by other animate and inanimate nonface stimuli. N170 was largest over the posterior temporal scalp and was larger over the right than the left hemisphere. N170 was delayed when faces were presented upside-down, but its amplitude did not change. When presented in isolation, eyes elicited an N170 that was significantly larger than that elicited by whole faces, while noses and lips elicited small negative ERPs about 50 msec later than N170. Distorted human faces, in which the locations of inner face components were altered, elicited an N170 similar in amplitude to that elicited by normal faces. However, faces of animals, human hands, cars, and items of furniture did not evoke N170. N170 may reflect the operation of a neural mechanism tuned to detect (as opposed to identify) human faces, similar to the 'structural encoder' suggested by Bruce and Young (1986). A similar function has been proposed for the face-selective N200 ERP recorded from the middle fusiform and posterior inferior temporal gyri using subdural electrodes in human. However, the differential sensitivity of N170 to eyes in isolation suggests that N170 may reflect the activation of an eye-sensitive region of cortex. The voltage distribution of N170 over the scalp is consistent with a neural generator located in the occipitotemporal sulcus lateral to the fusiform/inferior temporal region that generates N200.","Bentin, S.; Allison, T.; Puce, A.; Perez, E.; McCarthy, G.",J.

"Fairness, fast and slow: A review of dual process models of fairness","Fairness, the notion that people deserve or have rights to certain resources or kinds of treatment, is a fundamental dimension of moral cognition. Drawing on recent evidence from economics, psychology, and neuroscience, we ask whether self-interest is always intuitive, requiring self-control to override with reasoning-based fairness concerns, or whether fairness itself can be intuitive. While we find strong support for rejecting the notion that self-interest is always intuitive, the literature has reached conflicting conclusions about the neurocognitive systems underpinning fairness. We propose that this disagreement can largely be resolved in light of an extended Social Heuristics Hypothesis. Divergent findings may be attributed to the interpretation of behavioral effects of ego depletion or neurostimulation, reverse inference from brain activity to the underlying psychological process, and insensitivity to social context and inter-individual differences. To better dissect the neurobiological basis of fairness, we outline how future research should embrace cross-disciplinary methods that combine psychological manipulations with neuroimaging, and that can probe inter-individual, and cultural heterogeneities. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Hallsson, B.G.; Siebner, H.R.; Hulme, O.J.",Neurosci.

Application of compliance techniques to direct-mail requests for charitable donations,"The possibility that psychological compliance techniques might be applied to increase the effectiveness of direct-mail requests for charitable contributions is raised. Although there are few studies with direct bearing on this possibility, there is an extensive literature on compliance techniques in general and many studies on the effectiveness of such techniques when applied to verbal requests for contributions, most often in door-to-door campaigns. Research on the application of the foot-in-the-door, door-in-the-face, low-ball, and legitimization-of-small-donation techniques to verbal requests for charitable contributions is reviewed, and the relevance of these studies to potential direct-mail applications is explored. The few attempts to apply the legitimization of small contributions to the direct-mail mode, which have produced mixed results, are also reviewed and analyzed. It is suggested that successful application of compliance techniques to the direct-mail mode may depend on careful modifications of the techniques to calibrate them optimally to direct mail, and to the particular situations in which campaigns are to be undertaken.

Insuring Your Donation: An Experiment,"An increasing fraction of donations is channeled through donation intermediaries. These entities serve multiple purposes, one of which seems to be providing donors with greater certainty: that the donation reaches its intended goal, and that the donor may be sure to receive a tax benefit. We interpret this function as insurance and test the option to insure donations in the lab. Our participants indeed have a positive willingness to pay for insurance against either contingency. Yet the insurance option is only critical for their willingness to donate to a charity if the risk affects the proper use of their donation. Participants have a higher willingness to pay for insurance if, in case the risk materializes, they receive their money back. With this design of the insurance, almost no participant wants to donate if she is not insured. © 2017 Cornell Law School and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Buijze, R.; Engel, C.; Hemels, S.",J. Empir.

"I want to help you, but i am not sure why: Gaze-cuing induces altruistic giving","Detecting subtle indicators of trustworthiness is highly adaptive for moving effectively amongst social partners. One powerful signal is gaze direction, which individuals can use to inform (or deceive) by looking toward (or away from) important objects or events in the environment. Here, across 5 experiments, we investigate whether implicit learning about gaze cues can influence subsequent economic transactions; we also examine some of the underlying mechanisms. In the 1st experiment, we demonstrate that people invest more money with individuals whose gaze information has previously been helpful, possibly reflecting enhanced trust appraisals. However, in 2 further experiments, we show that other mechanisms driving this behavior include obligations to fairness or (painful) altruism, since people also make more generous offers and allocations of money to individuals with reliable gaze cues in adapted 1-shot ultimatum games and 1-shot dictator games. In 2 final experiments, we show that the introduction of perceptual noise while following gaze can disrupt these effects, but only when the social partners are unfamiliar. Nonconscious detection of reliable gaze cues can prompt altruism toward others, probably reflecting the interplay of systems that encode identity and control gaze-evoked attention, integrating the reinforcement value of gaze cues. © 2013 American Psychological Association.","Rogers, R.D.; Bayliss, A.P.; Szepietowska, A.; Dale, L.; Reeder, L.; Pizzamiglio, G.; Czarna, K.; Wakeley, J.; Cowen, P.J.; Tipper, S.P.",J.

Promoting multiple policies to the Public: The difficulties of simultaneously promoting war and foreign humanitarian aid,"To drum up support for the U.S. military's efforts abroad, government officials sometimes encourage U.S. residents to justify or excuse (morally disengage from) the resultant casualties. Although more disengaged U.S. residents are more supportive of war, two studies show that they are also less supportive of foreign humanitarian aid, particularly when American identity is salient and a more global identity, such as moral identity, is not. Study 1 reveals this effect when residents must choose between donating to a charity that benefits foreign civilians and donating to two other charities, one of which benefits U.S. soldiers. Study 2 shows that the effect holds when the opportunity to support foreign civilians appears in isolation, without reference to war or soldiers. Thus, U.S. residents who respond positively to war may exhibit less charitableness toward foreign civilians. For policy makers seeking to disburse foreign aid during war, these findings suggest that any effort to drum up support for war should be accompanied by a corresponding effort to maintain the U.S. public's goodwill toward foreign civilians. © 2011, American Marketing Association.","Finnel, S.; Reed II, A.; Aquino, K.",J.

Incentivizing blood donation: systematic review and meta-analysis to test Titmuss' hypotheses,"OBJECTIVES: Titmuss hypothesized that paying blood donors would reduce the quality of the blood donated and would be economically inefficient. We report here the first systematic review to test these hypotheses, reporting on both financial and nonfinancial incentives. METHOD: Studies deemed eligible for inclusion were peer-reviewed, experimental studies that presented data on the quantity (as a proxy for efficiency) and quality of blood donated in at least two groups: those donating blood when offered an incentive, and those donating blood with no offer of an incentive. The following were searched: MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycINFO using OVID SP, CINAHL via EBSCO and CENTRAL, the Cochrane Library, Econlit via EBSCO, JSTOR Health and General Science Collection, and Google. RESULTS: The initial search yielded 1100 abstracts, which resulted in 89 full papers being assessed for eligibility, of which seven studies, reported in six papers, met the inclusion criteria. The included studies involved 93,328 participants. Incentives had no impact on the likelihood of donation (OR = 1.22 CI 95% 0.91-1.63; p = .19). There was no difference between financial and nonfinancial incentives in the quantity of blood donated. Of the two studies that assessed quality of blood, one found no effect and the other found an adverse effect from the offer of a free cholesterol test (β = 0.011 p < .05). CONCLUSION: The limited evidence suggests that Titmuss' hypothesis of the economic inefficiency of incentives is correct. There is insufficient evidence to assess their likely impact on the quality of the blood provided.","Niza, Claudia; Tung, Burcu; Marteau, Theresa M",Health Psychol.,882

This article looks at elements of crowd-out, both the direct impact on donors and the indirect impact caused by the response of nonprofits. We include both theoretical and empirical analyses of the reactions by donors and nonprofits to an increase in government funding based on data from the League of American Orchestras' annual reports from 2004 to 2007. To combat indirect crowd-out, renewed emphasis should be placed on grant design; for direct crowd-out, theories of collective action are appropriate. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Hughes, P.; Luksetich, W.; Rooney, P.",Nonprofit Manage.

The empathy-prospect model and the choice to help,"This paper presents a model of the cognitive processes that precede decisions to help another person. The empathy-prospect model predicts that potential helpers make decisions in much the same way as decision makers in other contexts do (i.e., they evaluate prospects) and that perceptions of need and the empathic reactions and intentions to help that they generate will be stronger for people observing losses rather than gains. The model also predicts that intentions to help should increase when (a) the predicament is serious, (b) money is not involved, or (c) help entails few costs for the potential altruist. The results from 2 experiments provide clear support for these predictions. The findings suggest that (a) the gains or losses of another person contribute to perceptions of that person's needs and feelings of empathy, (b) empathy is the primary proximal determinant of prosocial motivations, and (c) potential losses that are serious accentuate altruistic reactions.","Lee, J.A.; Murnighan, J.K.",J.

A self-presentational view of social phenomena,"Self-presentation is the use of behavior to communicate some information about oneself to others. The 2 main self-presentational motives are to please the audience and to construct (create, maintain, and modify) one's public self congruent to one's ideal. It is proposed that a wide range of social behavior is determined or influenced by these self-presentational concerns. Research evidence is examined to show the relevance of the self-presentational motives to giving and receiving help, conformity, reactance, attitude expression and change, responses to evaluations, aggressive behavior, self-serving and counter-defensive attributional statements, task performance, ingratiation, and emotion.

Success in an Online Giving Day: The Role of Social Media in Fundraising,"Social media platforms offer nonprofits considerable potential for crafting, supporting, and executing successful fundraising campaigns. How impactful are attempts by these organizations to utilize social media to support fundraising activities associated with online Giving Days? We address this question by testing a number of hypotheses of the effectiveness of using Facebook for fundraising purposes by all 704 nonprofits participating in Omaha Gives 2015. Using linked administrative and social media data, we find that fundraising success—as measured by the number of donors and value of donations—is positively associated with a nonprofit’s Facebook network size (number of likes), activity (number of posts), and audience engagement (number of shares), as well as net effects of organizational factors including budget size, age, and program service area. These results provide important new empirical insights into the relationship between social media utilization and fundraising success of nonprofits. © The Author(s) 2019.","Bhati, A.; McDonnell, D.",Nonprofit Volunt.

Rewarding altruism: addressing the issue of payments for volunteers in public health initiatives,"Lay involvement in public health programmes occurs through formalised lay health worker (LHW) and other volunteer roles. Whether such participation should be supported, or indeed rewarded, by payment is a critical question. With reference to policy in England, UK, this paper argues how framing citizen involvement in health only as time freely given does not account for the complexities of practice, nor intrinsic motivations. The paper reports results on payment drawn from a study of approaches to support lay people in public health roles, conducted in England, 2007-9. The first phase of the study comprised a scoping review of 224 publications, three public hearings and a register of projects. Findings revealed the diversity of approaches to payment, but also the contested nature of the topic. The second phase investigated programme support matters in five case studies of public health projects, which were selected primarily to reflect role types. All five projects involved volunteers, with two utilising forms of payment to support engagement. Interviews were conducted with a sample of project staff, LHWs (paid and unpaid), external partners and service users. Drawing on both lay and professional perspectives, the paper explores how payment relates to social context as well as various motivations for giving, receiving or declining financial support. The findings show that personal costs are not always absorbed, and that there is a potential conflict between financial support, whether sessional payment or expenses, and welfare benefits. In identifying some of the advantages and disadvantages of payment, the paper highlights the complexity of an issue often addressed only superficially. It concludes that, in order to support citizen involvement, fairness and value should be considered alongside pragmatic matters of programme management; however policy conflicts need to be resolved to ensure that employment and welfare rights are maintained.","South, Jane; Purcell, Martin E; Branney, Peter; Gamsu, Mark; White, Judy",Soc.

Safety of blood donation from individuals with treated hypertension or non-insulin dependent type 2 diabetes: a systematic review,"The overall level of evidence was limited. No evidence was found to indicate that blood donation by people with raised baseline blood pressure, treated hypertension or diabetes was associated with an increase in adverse effects in the donors. XCM: The review question was clearly stated, although study design was not specified. The search covered a number of relevant sources that included major databases and grey literature sources; this was likely to have reduced any effect of publication bias. As papers were excluded if they were published in languages other than English or did not have an English abstract, it was possible that language bias may have affected the review. The methods of study selection and data extraction did not aim at reducing reviewer error or bias. The quality of included studies was unclear and the authors did not state the methods used (such as how many reviewers performed the assessment). A narrative synthesis appeared appropriate given the diverse nature of included studies. Data came mainly from observational studies or small experimental studies; the authors commented on the limitations of data from these types of studies. The authors' conclusions seem cautious, but potential for bias in the review and the uncertain quality of the included studies should be taken into account when interpreting these conclusions.

Awakening Compassion in Managers—a New Emotional Skills Intervention to Improve Managerial Compassion,"Compassion is in high demand within organizational research, with important implications for leadership, well-being, and productivity. However, thus far only meditation-based interventions have been implemented to increase compassion in organizations. Our aim was to explore whether compassion could be increased among managers through improving their emotional skills. We implemented a quasi-randomized controlled trial with pre-test and post-test design of a new emotional skills cultivation training among managers, measuring the treatment group (N = 68), the control group (N = 90), and their followers (N = 85 and N = 72). Compared to the control group, the managers exhibited significantly increased sense of emotional skills, with some evidence for an improved sense of compassion. We also found that emotional skills mediated the impact of participating in the intervention group and compassion. Additionally, servant leadership behaviors in the intervention group improved following the intervention. These results demonstrate that instead of being something innate, compassion is a skill that can be increased through training emotional skills, with observable benefits for the organization. © 2020, The Author(s).","Paakkanen, M.; Martela, F.; Hakanen, J.; Uusitalo, L.; Pessi, A.",J.

A Comparison of Fixed-Effects and Mixed (Random-Effects) Models for Meta-Analysis Tests of Moderator Variable Effects,"The growing popularity of meta-analysis has focused increased attention on the statistical models analysts are using and the assumptions underlying these models. Although comparisons often have been limited to fixed-effects (FE) models, recently there has been a call to investigate the differences between FE and random-effects (RE) models, differences that may have substantial theoretical and applied implications (National Research Council, 1992). Three FE models (including L. V. Hedges & I. Olkin's, 1985, and R. Rosenthal's, 1991, tests) and 2 RE models were applied to simulated correlation data in tests for moderator effects. The FE models seriously underestimated and the RE models greatly overestimated sampling error variance when their basic assumptions were violated, which caused biased confidence intervals and hypothesis tests. The implications of these and other findings are discussed as are methodological issues concerning meta-analyses.","Overton, R.C.",Psychol. Methods,898
Number-needed-to-treat analysis of the prevention of myocardial infarction and death by antidyslipidemic therapy,"BACKGROUND: Atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries is the most common cause of death in the United States for persons over the age of 45. Dyslipidemia is one of the risk factors for the development of coronary atherosclerosis. Recent studies suggest that treating dyslipidemia in persons with coronary atherosclerosis may decrease morbidity and mortality. METHODS: A meta-analysis of 33 studies on the clinical and angiographic benefits of treating dyslipidemia in the prevention of morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular disease was performed. These benefits are quantitated in the form of ""number needed to treat"" (NNT) as an estimate of the public health benefit. The NNT is defined as the number of people that need to be treated to prevent one event. RESULTS: Treatment of dyslipidemia in persons with multiple atherosclerosis risk factors alone, ie, primary prevention, was effective in preventing myocardial infarction and all-cause death. In six trials of primary prevention, excluding the British cooperative trial using clofibrate, the NNT was 53 to prevent a nonfatal MI and 190 to prevent all-cause death (4.8 years treatment with total cholesterol reduction of 15%). Treatment of dyslipidemia in people with known atherosclerosis, ie, secondary and tertiary prevention, was also effective in preventing myocardial infarctions and death from all causes. For 23 trials of secondary and tertiary prevention, the NNT was 37 to prevent death from any cause (4.9 years treatment with total cholesterol reduction of 18%). In the trials with quantitative angiography, the NNT was 7 to prevent progression of coronary atherosclerosis and 10 to induce regression of coronary atherosclerosis (2.5 years treatment with a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol reduction of 28%). Similar benefits were observed in those trials employing HMG CoA reductase inhibitors. Benefits may be similar with niacin or dietary therapy, but these therapies did not reach significance in all categories of benefits, potentially due to beta error. These treatment benefits are comparable to other secondary prevention measures such as aspirin or beta blockers. The benefits appeared to extend to persons over 65, with less clearly defined benefits for women. CONCLUSIONS: These results support the overall clinical benefit of treating dyslipidemia, both in persons with and without known atherosclerosis.","Rembold, C M",J. Fam. Pract.,899

THE IMPACT OF TAX PRICE CHANGES ON CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE NEEDY,"Eliminating or reducing the federal charitable deduction can have serious impacts on the level of charitable donations. Tax price elasticity estimates from a multivariate sample selection model indicate that changing the deduction to a 12% tax credit would have reduced individual donations in 2012 by 18.9% if applied to itemizing taxpayers and by 10.5% if extended to nonitemizers. Elimination of the deduction would have led to a 35% reduction in individual charitable donations. Even if coupled with cuts in marginal tax rates, eliminating the charitable deduction will still likely result in substantial reductions given the inelastic income elasticities of charitable donations. The estimates justify the ardent opposition of many in the nonprofit sector to the more radical proposals for changing the tax treatment of charitable contributions.

The Nutritional Quality of Food Provided from Food Pantries: A Systematic Review of Existing Literature,"BACKGROUND: In many affluent countries, food-insecure households use food pantries to keep their family fed. The long-term dependence of many users on these programs calls for a systematic review of studies on the nutritional quality of food provided by food pantries. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this systematic review was to summarize the current scientific evidence about the nutritional quality of food bags distributed by food pantries. METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted in the electronic databases PubMed, PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, and Psychology Behavioral Sciences Collection to identify cross-sectional, cohort, and intervention studies reporting baseline data conducted in high-income countries and published between 1980 and 2015, which reported the nutritional quality of food bags distributed by food pantries. Identified citations were screened in two stages and data were independently extracted by two authors using a predefined data sheet. The quality of included studies was evaluated using criteria of an adapted Ottawa Scale. The systematic review was reported in accordance to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. RESULTS: Applying the two-stage screening, 9 of 1,546 articles were identified for inclusion. Nutritional quality of food bags varied widely between and within studies. Milk products, vitamins A and C, and calcium were provided in particularly low amounts. None of the studies were nationally representative and only a few studies controlled for the household composition of the recipients of food bags. CONCLUSION: Food pantries likely have a strong influence on users' diets, but the food pantries examined in the selected studies were largely unable to support healthy diets. The distribution of more perishable foods would increase users' diet quality and may have an immense potential to address malnutrition in vulnerable population groups.","Simmet, Anja; Depa, Julia; Tinnemann, Peter; Stroebele-Benschop, Nanette",J.

The economic impact of initiatives to reduce stigma: demonstration of a modelling approach,AIMS: This paper seeks to provide a methodology to assess the cost-effectiveness of anti-stigma campaigns for people with mental health problems. METHODS: The costs of running a national campaign in Scotland were obtained and combined with the number of adults in the Scottish population and the estimated number of people with improved attitudes towards people with mental health problems. A decision model was constructed to estimate the economic impact of a campaign in terms of increased use of services by people with depression and increased work time. RESULTS: If the campaign caused 10% of changed attitudes then it was estimated to cost pound 35 per one less person who felt that people with mental health problems were dangerous and pound 186 per one less person who felt the public needs protection from people with mental health problems. The decision model suggested extra economic benefits (employment gains minus service costs) as a result of an anti-stigma campaign compared to the absence of a campaign. CONCLUSIONS: Data on the economic impact of anti-stigma campaigns are scarce and evaluation is intrinsically difficult. We have demonstrated a method to conduct such analyses. The model proposed here should be tested further as data become available.,"McCrone, Paul; Knapp, Martin; Henri, Mary; McDaid, David",Epidemiol. Psichiatr. Soc.,906
High stakes and acceptance behavior in ultimatum bargaining: A contribution from an international experiment,"This paper presents the results of a within-subject experiment testing whether an increase in the monetary stakes by a factor of 50-which had never been done before-influences individual behavior in a simple ultimatum bargaining game. Contrary to current wisdom, we found that lowest acceptable offers stated by the responder are proportionally lower in the high-stake condition than in the low-stake condition. This result may be interpreted in terms of the type of utility functions which characterize the subjects. However, in line with prior results, we find that an important increase of the monetary stakes in the ultimatum game has no effect on the offers made by the proposer. Yet, the present research suggests that the reasons underlying these offers are quite different when the stakes are high.","Munier, B.; Zaharia, C.",Theory Decis,907
"An uncertainty management perspective on long-run impacts of adversity: The influence of childhood socioeconomic status on risk, time, and social preferences","While there has been a recent increase in focus on the role of early life socioeconomic status (SES) on preferences and decision-making, there is still debate surrounding the proper theoretical framework for understanding such effects. Some have argued that early life SES can fundamentally shift time preferences per se, such that those from low SES backgrounds favor current rewards over future rewards. Others have argued that, while early life SES has lasting effects on behavior, such effects are only observable in the presence of salient cues to mortality. Here, we propose an alternative framework that centers on environmental uncertainty. In this uncertainty management framework, early life deprivation promotes the development of strategies that minimize the downside costs of uncertainty across domains. We argue that this focus on managing uncertainty results in greater risk-aversion, present-orientation, and prosociality. Furthermore, these effects need not be dependent on salient cues to mortality. Across four large samples of participants (total N = 4714), we find that childhood deprivation uniquely predicts greater risk-aversion (both incentivized and hypothetical) and greater prosociality in economic games. Childhood deprivation also predicts greater present-orientation, but not above-and beyond current SES. We further find that mortality cues are not necessary to elicit these differences. Our results support an uncertainty management perspective on the effects of childhood SES on risk, time, and social preferences. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Amir, D.; Jordan, M.R.; Rand, D.G.",J. Exp.

Heuristic versus systematic information processing and the use of source versus message cues in persuasion,"In Exp I, 183 undergraduates read a persuasive message from a likable or unlikable communicator who presented 6 or 2 arguments on 1 of 2 topics. High involvement (HI) Ss anticipated discussing the message topic at a future experimental session, whereas low-involvement (LI) Ss anticipated discussing a different topic. For HI Ss, opinion change was significantly greater given 6 arguments but was unaffected by communicator likability. For LI Ss, opinion change was significantly greater given a likable communicator but was unaffected by the argument's manipulation. In Exp II with 80 similar Ss, HI Ss showed slightly greater opinion change when exposed to 5 arguments from an unlikable (vs 1 argument from a likable) communicator, whereas LI Ss exhibited significantly greater persuasion in response to 1 argument from a likable (vs 5 arguments from an unlikable) communicator. Findings support the idea that HI leads message recipients to employ a systematic information processing strategy in which message-based cognitions mediate persuasion, whereas LI leads recipients to use a heuristic processing strategy in which simple decision rules mediate persuasion. Support was also obtained for the hypothesis that content- vs source-mediated opinion change would result in greater persistence.

Is fairness intuitive? An experiment accounting for subjective utility differences under time pressure,"Evidence from response time studies and time pressure experiments has led several authors to conclude that “fairness is intuitive”. In light of conflicting findings, we provide theoretical arguments showing under which conditions an increase in “fairness” due to time pressure indeed provides unambiguous evidence in favor of the “fairness is intuitive” hypothesis. Drawing on recent applications of the Drift Diffusion Model (Krajbich et al. in Nat Commun 6:7455, 2015a), we demonstrate how the subjective difficulty of making a choice affects decisions under time pressure and time delay, thereby making an unambiguous interpretation of time pressure effects contingent on the choice situation. To explore our theoretical considerations and to retest the “fairness is intuitive” hypothesis, we analyze choices in two-person binary dictator and prisoner’s dilemma games under time pressure or time delay. In addition, we manipulate the subjective difficulty of choosing the fair relative to the selfish option. Our main finding is that time pressure does not consistently promote fairness in situations where this would be predicted after accounting for choice difficulty. Hence, our results cast doubt on the hypothesis that “fairness is intuitive”. © 2018, Economic Science Association.","Merkel, A.L.; Lohse, J.",Exp. Econ.,910
"Effects of being watched on self-referential processing, self-awareness and prosocial behaviour","Reputation management theory suggests that our behaviour changes in the presence of others to signal good reputation (audience effect). However, the specific cognitive mechanisms by which being watched triggers these changes are poorly understood. Here we test the hypothesis that these changes happen because the belief in being watched increases self-referential processing. We used a novel deceptive video-conference paradigm, where participants believe a video-clip is (or is not) a live feed of a confederate watching them. Participants completed four tasks measuring self-referential processing, prosocial behaviour and self-awareness under these two belief settings. Although the belief manipulation and self-referential effect task were effective, there were no changes on self-referential processing between the two settings, nor on prosocial behaviour and self-awareness. Based on previous evidence and these findings, we propose that further research on the role of the self, social context and personality traits will help elucidating the mechanisms underlying audience effects. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Cañigueral, R.; Hamilton, A.F.D.C.",Conscious.

"Empathy and self-regulation as mediators between parenting and adolescents' prosocial behavior toward strangers, friends, and family","The current study examined the role of empathy and self-regulation as mediators between positive parenting (mothering and fathering) and early adolescents' prosocial behavior toward 3 targets (strangers, friends, and family). Data were taken from Time 1 and Time 2 of the Flourishing Families Project, and included reports from 500 families with an early adolescent child (mean age of child at Time 1=11.29). Analyses suggested that predictors of prosocial behavior toward the 3 targets differed, with empathy (as reported by mothers only) and self-regulation mediating the relation between positive parenting and prosocial behavior toward strangers and friends, but not toward family. Positive mothering was the only variable that was significantly related to prosocial behavior toward family. The discussion focuses on the need for continued research examining a relational approach to prosocial development. © 2010 The Authors.

"Insights from a systematic review of literature on social enterprise and networks: Where, how and what next?","Purpose: This paper aims to contribute to better understanding of where and how network concepts, theories and perspectives, organisational networks, and networking practices, are being studied and deployed in social enterprise research. This is done through a systematic review of social enterprise and networks literature in business and management journals. Key trends and developments in this literature, and gaps and limitations, are identified, culminating in discussion of what next for social enterprise and networks research. The papers in this special issue on “Social Enterprise and Networks” are introduced. Design/methodology/approach: A systematic review was undertaken of social enterprise and networks literature in business and management journals. Journals sampled included all those in the Entrepreneurship and Small Business subject area of the Association of Business Schools (ABS) Academic Journal Guide 2018, the journals in the Financial Times 50 research ranking, and selected wider business and society, non-profit management and public administration journals. Findings: Analysis of publishing patterns of social enterprise and networks research finds that such research is growing, and that varied network perspectives, concepts and theories are being deployed. Social enterprise and networks are also being studied globally, using different methodologies. Nevertheless, there remains scope for deeper theoretical engagement, and for a wider range of network theories to be used. More even geographic coverage is also needed, and further insights can be gained through use of alternative methodologies. Research limitations/implications: Discussions in this paper have implications for research through outlining systematically the state of current scholarship on social enterprise and networks. In so doing, insight is provided on what is known about social enterprise and networks. But also on what is not known and where further enquiry is needed. Direction is thus provided for future social enterprise and networks scholarship. Practical implications: In this paper, how, and the extent to which, social enterprise and networks scholarship offers implications for practice and policy is considered. Originality/value: This paper makes a valuable contribution to social enterprise scholarship. It outlines the state of current knowledge and research on social enterprise and networks, identifying where and how relationships between social enterprise and networks have been studied, whilst also providing insights for what next in future social enterprise and networks research. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Littlewood, David; Khan, Zaheer",Social Enterprise Journal,918
Do public grants to American theatres crowd-out private donations?,"This paper examines the relationship between public support and private donations by disaggregating the crowding effect into two components: one determined by level of public support and one determined by changes in public support levels. The analysis of a panel of American non-profit theatres shows that the crowding effect induced by the level of public support takes an inverted U shape: at low levels public support crowds-in private donations while at higher levels it displaces them. The change in total public support in the past year produces a constant crowding-in effect on the level of private donations. The paper finally illustrates how federal and state support have a crowding-in effect at all levels, while local support has a similar impact to total public support. © Springer 2006.","Borgonovi, F.",Public Choice,919

The Differential Effects of Anger on Trust: A Cross-Cultural Comparison of the Effects of Gender and Social Distance,"Accumulating empirical evidence suggests that anger elicited in one situation can influence trust behaviors in another situation. However, the conditions under which anger influences trust are still unclear. The present study addresses this research gap and examines the ways in which anger influences trust. We hypothesized that the social distance to the trustee, and the trusting person’s gender would moderate the effect of anger on trust. To test this hypothesis, a study using a 2 (Anger vs. Control) × 2 (Low vs. High social distance) × 2 (Men vs. Women) factorial design was conducted in Germany (N = 215) and in China (N = 310). Results reveal that in both countries men’s trust behavior was not influenced by the manipulations (i.e., anger and social distance). The pattern for women, however, differed by country. In Germany, women’s trust to a stranger (i.e., high social distance) was increased by anger; while in China, women’s trust to someone who they have communicated with (i.e., low social distance) was increased by anger. These results indicate that women’s trust levels seem to be more context-sensitive than men’s. © Copyright © 2020 Zhang, Goetz, Chen and Sverdlik.","Zhang, K.; Goetz, T.; Chen, F.; Sverdlik, A.",Front.

Social heuristics and social roles: Intuition favors altruism for women but not for men,"Are humans intuitively altruistic, or does altruism require self-control? A theory of social heuristics, whereby intuitive responses favor typically successful behaviors, suggests that the answer may depend on who you are. In particular, evidence suggests that women are expected to behave altruistically, and are punished for failing to be altruistic, to a much greater extent than men. Thus, women (but not men) may internalize altruism as their intuitive response. Indeed, a meta-analysis of 13 new experiments and 9 experiments from other groups found that promoting intuition relative to deliberation increased giving in a Dictator Game among women, but not among men (Study 1, N = 4,366). Furthermore, this effect was shown to be moderated by explicit sex role identification (Study 2, N = 1,831): the more women described themselves using traditionally masculine attributes (e.g., dominance, independence) relative to traditionally feminine attributes (e.g., warmth, tenderness), the more deliberation reduced their altruism. Our findings shed light on the connection between gender and altruism, and highlight the importance of social heuristics in human prosociality.","Rand, David G; Brescoll, Victoria L; Everett, Jim A C; Capraro, Valerio; Barcelo, Hélène",J.

"Money donations, volunteering and organizational efficiency","The purpose of this article is to explain the cross-sectional variation in money donations to charities at the organizational level. Using a unique data base which includes volunteer labor data, this article tests the hypotheses that money donations are positively related to volunteering and the technical efficiency of the firm. Technical efficiency is measured by a number of non-parametric indices. The empirical results indicate inter alia that the more technically efficient the charity, the more money donations it is able to raise. Moreoer, at least for one model, money donations and volunteering are found to be complementary at the organizational level. In addition, the results in this article are not consistent with the well-known hypothesis that government financing crowds out private donations. © 1994 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","Callen, J.L.",J Prod Anal,925
Endovascular stenting versus open surgery for thoracic aortic disease: systematic review and meta-analysis of perioperative results,"Results suggest that endovascular thoracic aortic repair reduces perioperative mortality and major neurological injury in stable patients with descending thoracic aortic aneurysms compared to open surgery. The benefit in other aortic conditions is less clear. XCM: The review question was supported by clear inclusion criteria. Several sources were searched without restriction and the authors attempted to locate unpublished material, minimising the likelihood of language and publication bias. It is unclear whether steps were taken to minimise the likelihood of reviewer error and bias in selecting papers for inclusion in the review, data extraction and assessment of study quality. Total scores for the quality assessment were reported. Standard meta-analytic methods were used. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed and subgroup analysis performed. Despite some minor limitations in reporting the authors' conclusions are likely to be reliable. XIM: Practice: the authors did not state any implications for practice.Research: the authors stated that future studies should avoid comparisons with historical open controls and use consecutive contemporaneous control patients. At a minimum, future reports should also provide 30-day mortality rates, cerebrovascular accident, paraplegia and major reintervention rates. The authors highlighted a lack of comprehensive cost-effectiveness analysis comparing endovascular stenting and open surgery.","Walsh, S R; Tang, T Y; Sadat, U; Naik, J; Gaunt, M E; Boyle, J R; Hayes, P D; Varty, K",,926
Economic games on the internet: The effect of $1 stakes,"Online labor markets such as Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) offer an unprecedented opportunity to run economic game experiments quickly and inexpensively. Using Mturk, we recruited 756 subjects and examined their behavior in four canonical economic games, with two payoff conditions each: a stakes condition, in which subjects' earnings were based on the outcome of the game (maximum earnings of $1); and a no-stakes condition, in which subjects' earnings are unaffected by the outcome of the game. Our results demonstrate that economic game experiments run on MTurk are comparable to those run in laboratory settings, even when using very low stakes. © 2012 Amir et al.","Amir, O.; Rand, D.G.; Gal, Y.K.",PLoS ONE,927
"Think twice before using door-in-the-face tactics in repeated negotiation: Effects on negotiated outcomes, trust and perceived ethical behaviour","Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the detrimental effects of the door-in-the-face (DITF) tactic in repeated negotiation. A more complete understanding of its negative consequences is essential to make an informed decision about its use. Design/methodology/approach: This paper is the product of two between-subjects scenario-based negotiation experiments involving university students in Hong Kong (Study 1) and professionals in the UK with negotiation experience (Study 2). Findings: Both the studies herein showed that detecting opponents using this tactic reduced the degree to which negotiators found their counterparts trustworthy. It also increased the likelihood of negotiators switching to an alternative partner in a collaborative project. This relationship is mediated by perceived trustworthiness. Negotiators who had detected opponents’ use of DITF made higher offers and obtained better outcomes in a subsequent negotiation. These findings indicate that negotiators who benefitted from DITF considered its use ethical, while those who suffered because of its use by others found it unethical. Practical implications: Before using DITF, users should be wary of the likelihood they and their counterpart will negotiate again and/or will collaborate in a future project. Originality/value: This paper presents a new perspective from which the use of DITF may backfire in a subsequent negotiation, in terms of both objective and subjective outcomes. This is, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, the first paper to address how user and victim judge the ethicality of DITF tactics. The findings offer a building block for future research on other compliance techniques in repeated negotiations. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Wong, R.S.; Howard, S.",Int. J. Confl.

For Your Eyes Only: A Field Experiment on Nudging Hygienic Behavior,"These days many gyms and fitness centers are closed to reduce transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in society. The gym is an environment rich in microorganisms, and careful hygiene is a necessity to keep infections at bay. Exercise centers strive for better hygiene compliance among their members. This effort has become essential in light of the current pandemic. Several experimental studies show that others’ physical presence, or the “illusion” of being watched, may alter behavior. This article reports on a natural field experiment testing one specific social nudge intended to increase gym members’ hygienic behavior. The study was conducted before the SARS-COV-2 pandemic. A picture of “observing eyes” was attached to paper dispensers and cleanser spray bottles at two different gyms in Norway. A reversal design, also called an ABA design, with and without the nudge’s presence, was used to investigate the impact on gym members’ hygienic behavior. A follow-up study was conducted in one of the centers to investigate whether the nudge stimuli would function over time. The study included 254 individual choice situations during nine observation sessions conducted over 9 weeks. The results from both centers provide evidence of a strong effect of the nudge. However, the effect decreased during the follow-up study. These findings support previous research indicating that human behavior is influenced by the presence of implicit observation cues – in this case – observing eyes. However, insights into the long-term effect of implicit observation cues are still needed since the salience of the stimuli faded over time. © Copyright © 2020 Mobekk, Hessen, Fagerstrøm and Jacobsen.","Mobekk, H.; Hessen, D.O.; Fagerstrøm, A.; Jacobsen, H.",Front.

Contagion of pro- and anti-social behavior among peers and the role of social proximity,"This paper uses a novel experimental design to study the contagion of pro- and anti-social behavior and the role of social proximity among peers. Across systematic variations thereof, we find that anti-social behavior is generally more contagious than pro-social behavior. Surprisingly, we also find that social proximity amplifies the contagion of anti-social behavior more strongly than the contagion of pro-social behavior. Anti-social individuals are also most susceptible to the behavioral contagion of other anti-social peers. These findings paired with the methodological contribution inform the design of effective norm-based policy interventions directed at facilitating pro-social behavior and reducing anti-social behavior in social and economic environments. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Dimant, E.",J.

"Affect, moral intuition, and risk","The natural way to deal with moral issues involving risk is to rely on our intuitive feelings. ""How bad is it? Well, how bad does it feel?"" We can also rely on reason to determine right and wrong but, as Jonathan Haidt has demonstrated, intuition comes first and dominates our responses unless we make an effort to critique and, if necessary, override it. We argue that our intuitive feelings are insensitive to large losses of life and thus mislead us in the face of natural disasters or human disasters associated with poverty, disease, and violence. Our intuitions seduce us into calmly turning away from these catastrophes, when we should be driven by outrage or sorrow to act. We propose ways to overcome this insensitivity through new forms of education and communication coupled with reliance on moral deliberation aimed at designing laws and institutions that compel attention to such problems. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Slovic, P.; Västfjäll, D.",Psychol.

A cognitive (attribution)-emotion-action model of motivated behavior: An analysis of judgments of help-giving,"Examined the relations of causal attributions and affect to judgments of help-giving in a total of 280 undergraduates in 6 experiments. The influence of 3 dimensions of causality (locus, stability, and control) on judgments concerning the lending of class notes was evaluated. Ratings of help were lowest when the cause of the need was internal to the actor and controllable (e.g., lack of effort). It is suggested that ascriptions to internal controllable factors maximized negative affect (disgust and anger) and promoted avoidance behavior. However, attributions to uncontrollable factors (e.g., ability or teacher shortcomings) were anticipated to generate positive affect (sympathy) and give rise to approach behavior (help). These hypotheses and an attributional model of helping were investigated using a simulational judgment paradigm with both correlational and experimental designs and scenarios describing a drunk or a disabled individual in need of aid. ANOVA indicated the existence of a temporal sequence of attribution-affect-action in which attributions guide feelings, but emotional reactions provide the motor and direction for behavior.

Meaning or money? Non-profit employee satisfaction,"Employees choosing careers with community-based non-profit human services organisations engaged in meeting human needs expecting intrinsic satisfaction often find that the same care and commitment espoused in mission statements are not reflected internally as a commitment to employee satisfaction. These frontline workers are at risk of becoming disillusioned by increasing demands for compliance, internal and external disparities in salaries, unpaid work hours and difficulties in achieving outcomes. Using Herzberg's two-factor theory as a framework, this article incorporates a systematic review of literature per the discipline of evidence-based research to examine the potential of applying non-monetary satisfiers to invigorate the human services workforce. The article, which includes recommendations for management, focuses on the environment for frontline workers and includes creating a flexible workplace as well as implementing best practices for intentionally engaging employees in decision making and problem solving.

Analyzing illumina gene expression microarray data from different tissues: methodological aspects of data analysis in the metaxpress consortium,"Microarray profiling of gene expression is widely applied in molecular biology and functional genomics. Experimental and technical variations make meta-analysis of different studies challenging. In a total of 3358 samples, all from German population-based cohorts, we investigated the effect of data preprocessing and the variability due to sample processing in whole blood cell and blood monocyte gene expression data, measured on the Illumina HumanHT-12 v3 BeadChip array.Gene expression signal intensities were similar after applying the log(2) or the variance-stabilizing transformation. In all cohorts, the first principal component (PC) explained more than 95% of the total variation. Technical factors substantially influenced signal intensity values, especially the Illumina chip assignment (33-48% of the variance), the RNA amplification batch (12-24%), the RNA isolation batch (16%), and the sample storage time, in particular the time between blood donation and RNA isolation for the whole blood cell samples (2-3%), and the time between RNA isolation and amplification for the monocyte samples (2%). White blood cell composition parameters were the strongest biological factors influencing the expression signal intensities in the whole blood cell samples (3%), followed by sex (1-2%) in both sample types. Known single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were located in 38% of the analyzed probe sequences and 4% of them included common SNPs (minor allele frequency >5%). Out of the tested SNPs, 1.4% significantly modified the probe-specific expression signals (Bonferroni corrected p-value<0.05), but in almost half of these events the signal intensities were even increased despite the occurrence of the mismatch. Thus, the vast majority of SNPs within probes had no significant effect on hybridization efficiency.In summary, adjustment for a few selected technical factors greatly improved reliability of gene expression analyses. Such adjustments are particularly required for meta-analyses.","Schurmann, Claudia; Heim, Katharina; Schillert, Arne; Blankenberg, Stefan; Carstensen, Maren; Dörr, Marcus; Endlich, Karlhans; Felix, Stephan B; Gieger, Christian; Grallert, Harald; Herder, Christian; Hoffmann, Wolfgang; Homuth, Georg; Illig, Thomas; Kruppa, Jochen; Meitinger, Thomas; Müller, Christian; Nauck, Matthias; Peters, Annette; Rettig, Rainer; Roden, Michael; Strauch, Konstantin; Völker, Uwe; Völzke, Henry; Wahl, Simone; Wallaschofski, Henri; Wild, Philipp S; Zeller, Tanja; Teumer, Alexander; Prokisch, Holger; Ziegler, Andreas",PLoS One,934

The door-in-the-face compliance strategy: An individual differences analysis of two models in an AIDS fundraising context,"This study examined the reciprocal concessions and self-presentation accounts of the door-in-the-face (DITF) compliance strategy within a fundraising context. Subjects were classified as low or high in exchange orientation, and as low or high in approval motivation on the basis of a pretest questionnaire. As predicted on the basis of reciprocal concessions theory, a significant interaction was obtained between exchange-orientation and message strategy. For high exchange-oriented subjects, the DITF message strategy substantially increased compliance rates, relative to the single-request control message. However, low exchange-oriented subjects were actually more charitable in response to the control message. Analysis of a post-treatment measure of obligation to the requestor revealed that obligation could account for less than half of the interaction effect, a finding which is inconsistent with concessions theory. Self-presentation theory suggests that DITF should work best when directed toward targets who are high in their approval motivation, but this hypothesized interaction between approval motivation and message strategy did not materialize. © 1996, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Bell, R.A.; Abrahams, M.F.; Clark, C.L.; Schlatter, C.",Int.

Probiotics for necrotizing enterocolitis: a systematic review,"The evidence appeared to lend support to the use of oral probiotics for the prevention of necrotising enterocolitis in pre-term infants less than 33 weeks' gestation and infants with very low birth weight. However, data were insufficient to comment on the safety of probiotics. XCM: The review question and inclusion criteria were clear. The search strategy was adequate, with no language restrictions. Limited attempts were made to identify unpublished studies. Study selection and quality assessment were undertaken in duplicate, which reduced the potential for reviewer bias and error, but it was unclear whether the same methods were used for data extraction. Adequate details of the included trials were presented, including the results of the quality assessment.In view of differences between trials in types of intervention and participant characteristics, a narrative synthesis was appropriate, although the synthesis was limited, with most results presented separately for the separate trials.This was a well-conducted systematic review and the authors' conclusions are likely to be reliable. XIM: Practice: The authors did not state any implications for practice.Research: The authors stated that further research was required to identify the optimal type, dose and timing of probiotics for pre-term infants and those with very low birth weight for the prevention of necrotising enterocolitis, as well as to assess potential adverse effects of such treatments. Future studies should have sufficient statistical power to assess the effects of probiotics on the incidence of severe necrotising enterocolitis, requirement for surgery, mortality attributable to necrotising enterocolitis, overall mortality and adverse events. Medium to long-term follow-up should involve secondary outcome measures such as growth, development and general well-being. Future studies should also have a standardised policy on breast milk donation.","Barclay, A R; Stenson, B; Simpson, J H; Weaver, L T; Wilson, D C",,940

Currency value moderates equity preference among young children,"Cooperative behavior depends in part on a preference for equitable outcomes. Recent research in behavioral economics assesses variables that influence adult concerns for equity, but few studies to date investigate the emergence of equitable behavior in children using similar economic games. We tested 288 3- to 6-year olds in an anonymous Dictator Game to assess how the value of the currency used affects equity preferences in children. To manipulate value, children played the game with their most or least favorite stickers. At all ages, we found a strong value effect with children donating more of their least favorite stickers than their favorite stickers. We also found a dramatic increase with age in the percentage of children who were prosocial (i.e. donated at least one sticker). However, children who were prosocial tended to give the same proportion of stickers at all ages - about half of their least favorite stickers and 40% of their favorite stickers. These findings highlight the influence of resource value on children's preference for equity, and provide evidence for two different processes underlying altruistic giving: the decision to donate at all and the decision about how much to donate. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.","Blake, P.R.; Rand, D.G.",Evol.

The effect of a robotic agent on dishonest behavior,"Future human-robot interactions will have to consider different human traits. One human feature that may be affected by the presence of virtual agents or robots is human honesty. Will people try to take advantage in the presence of a robot/virtual agent? Some previous studies have shown that the physical presence of a robot can decrease cheating in humans. In this paper, we investigated if merely a simple video of a robot looking at the user was enough to affect human's cheating behavior. Further, we also investigated if the Honesty-Humility personality trait predicted cheating. We conducted a study with 160 participants that were randomly allocated to one of two conditions: (1) performing the task with a video of a robot looking at them, or (2) doing the task alone. Results showed that being alone or with a video of a robot produced equal levels of cheating and the Honesty-Humility dimension predicted cheating, particularly the fairness sub-domain was responsible for predicting cheating behavior. This study has implications for future scenarios where dishonesty might be tempting, and physical presence of an observer might not be possible. © 2020 ACM.","Petisca, S.; Paiva, A.; Esteves, F.","Proc.

Does price matter in charitable giving? Evidence from a large-scale natural field experiment,"We conducted a natural field experiment to further our understanding of the economics of charity. Using direct mail solicitations to over 50,000 prior donors of a nonprofit organization, we tested the effectiveness of a matching grant on charitable giving. We find that the match offer increases both the revenue per solicitation and the response rate. Larger match ratios (i.e., $3:$1 and $2:$1) relative to a smaller match ratio ($1:$1) had no additional impact, however. The results provide avenues for future empirical and theoretical work on charitable giving, cost-benefit analysis, and the private provision of public goods.","Karlan, D.; List, J.A.",Am. Econ.

How much is it going to cost me? Bidirectional relations between adolescents' moral personality and prosocial behavior,"The current study examined bidirectional relations between adolescents' moral personality (prosocial values, self-regulation, and sympathy) and low- and high-cost prosocial behavior toward strangers. Participants included 682 adolescents (M age of child=14.31, SD=1.07, 50% female) who participated at two time points, approximately one year apart. Cross-lag analyses suggested that adolescents' values were associated with both low- and high-cost prosocial behavior one year later, self-regulation was associated with high-cost prosocial behavior, and sympathy was associated with low-cost prosocial behavior. Findings also suggested that low-cost prosocial behavior was associated with sympathy one year later, and high-cost prosocial behavior was associated with values. Discussion focuses on reciprocal relations between moral personality and prosocial behavior, and the need to consider a more multidimensional approach to prosocial development during adolescence. © 2014 The Foundation for Professionals in Services for Adolescents.","Padilla-Walker, L.M.; Fraser, A.M.",J.

Helping one or helping many? A theoretical integration and meta-analytic review of the compassion fade literature,"Researchers and practitioners in the area of charitable giving have long lamented the tendency to offer greater aid to one person who is suffering rather than to a large group with the same needs. Demonstrations of such compassion fade are common in the literature, although different explanations for these findings exist. To reconcile both past theory and empirical research, we utilized a dual concern framing (De Dreu, 2006; Pruitt & Rubin, 1985) in conducting a meta-analysis of 41 studies (95 independent samples; 13,259 total sample size) on compassion fade. Results suggest that victim group size negatively affects both helping intent and helping behavior, as well as our proposed mediating mechanisms of anticipated positive affect (self-oriented motivation) and perceived impact (hybrid other-/self-oriented motivation). However, significant effects were not found for empathetic concern (other-oriented motivation). Results also showed that the indirect effects of victim group size on helping are stronger through anticipated positive affect and perceived impact than through empathetic concern. Further, as indicated by supplemental analyses, anticipated positive affect and perceived impact likely operate as predictors of empathetic concern in a serial mediation process through which victim groups size affects helping. Finally, we examined calamity scope (number of victims) and event features (certainty, chronicity, and threat severity) as moderators of the observed relationships between victim group size and helping. Theoretical implications and directions for future compassion fade research emanating from these findings are discussed.

Does Government Funding Alter Nonprofit Governance? Evidence from New York City Nonprofit Contractors,"Government contracting has raised a collection of issues with respect to adequate oversight and accountability. This paper explores one avenue through which contracting agencies may achieve these tasks: through the governance practices of the contractor's board. Oversight and monitoring are a board's key responsibilities, and influencing a board's practices is one way a governmental agency can help to insure quality performance. Agencies could thus use both their selection process and their post-contracting power to influence board practice. Using a new, rich data set on the nonprofit contractors of New York City, a series of hypotheses were tested on the relationship between government funding and board practices. Significant differences were found to exist in board practices as a function of government funding levels, differences that mark a shift of energy away from some activities (i.e., traditional board functions, such as fund-raising) towards others (financial monitoring and advocacy). This suggests that government agencies may indeed use their contracting choices with an eye to particular governance practices. This increased emphasis on such activities appears to crowd out other activities, and is not unambiguously to the benefit of nonprofit board governance. © 2002 by the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management.","O'Regan, K.; Oster, S.",J.

Economic analysis of erythropoietin use in orthopaedic surgery,"The aim was to assess the cost-effectiveness of erythropoietin (EPO) to reduce patients' exposure to perioperative allogenic blood products in orthopaedic surgery. The use of EPO was assessed for EPO used alone and for EPO, to augment preoperative autologous donation (PAD). A decision analytical model was designed incorporating (i) the risk of receiving allogeneic blood, (ii) the costs of blood products, (iii) the likelihood of developing transfusion-related diseases, (iv) the costs of transfusion-related diseases, (v) the impact of transfusion-related diseases on patient morbidity and mortality and (vi) the effect of EPO upon the probability of transfusion. The efficacy of EPO was derived from data from a meta-analysis of published randomized trials. Estimates for the other parameters were obtained by a systematic review of the literature. EPO alone led to only modest incremental benefit compared to no intervention for orthopaedic surgery (0.000024 life-years gained per patient). As an augmentation to PAD, EPO also led to modest benefits (0.000006 life-years gained per patient). For EPO compared to no intervention, the incremental cost per life-year gained was $66 million (Canadian). For EPO to augment PAD, the incremental cost per life-year gained was $329 million (Canadian). Detailed sensitivity analysis did not reveal any circumstances in which the cost-effectiveness ratios reached a level generally considered attractive. On the basis of cost-effectiveness, the use of EPO to reduce perioperative allogeneic transfusions in orthopaedic surgery did not meet criteria conventionally considered acceptable.","Coyle, D; Lee, K M; Fergusson, D A; Laupacis, A",Transfus.

However, there remained evidence from higher quality RCTs to support the use of a manual therapy package, compared with GP care, for non-specific lower back pain of at least six weeks duration. XCM: Inclusion criteria for the review were clearly defined. Several relevant databases were searched; search terms were not provided. Publication bias was not assessed and could not be ruled out. The potential for language bias was unclear. Suitable methods were used to minimise the risk of reviewer bias during quality assessment, but the authors did not report on whether such methods were used for study selection and data extraction.Trial quality assessment was undertaken according to a modified version of Van Tulder criteria; an assessment of the trial size and statistical rigour was also conducted, which gave a good indication of trial quality. However, there was a lack of details on the trial participants which may affect generalisability. The trial outcomes were assessed using L’Abbe plots. Other graphical techniques were used to determine the effects of quality and trial size on outcomes, which appeared appropriate.Overall, the authors’ conclusions were suitably cautious and consistent with the review aims and available evidence. XIM: Practice: The authors stated that at this point in time, manipulation used in isolation cannot be recommended. Likewise no recommendations can be made for massage interventions due to the lack of RCTs fulfilling all criteria for best available evidence. Research: The authors stated that future RCTs to inform clinical practice should have an adequate sample size, methodological quality and statistical rigour. Future trials should use relevant and valid outcome measures and identify subgroups where specific treatments may be most effective.","Hettinga, D M; Hurley, D A; Jackson, A; May, S; Mercer, C; Roberts, L",,955
Self-efficacy: Toward a unifying theory of behavioral change,"Presents an integrative theoretical framework to explain and to predict psychological changes achieved by different modes of treatment. This theory states that psychological procedures, whatever their form, alter the level and strength of self-efficacy. It is hypothesized that expectations of personal efficacy determine whether coping behavior will be initiated, how much effort will be expended, and how long it will be sustained in the face of obstacles and aversive experiences. Persistence in activities that are subjectively threatening but in fact relatively safe produces, through experiences of mastery, further enhancement of self-efficacy and corresponding reductions in defensive behavior. In the proposed model, expectations of personal efficacy are derived from 4 principal sources of information: performance accomplishments, vicarious experience, verbal persuasion, and physiological states. Factors influencing the cognitive processing of efficacy information arise from enactive, vicarious, exhortative, and emotive sources. The differential power of diverse therapeutic procedures is analyzed in terms of the postulated cognitive mechanism of operation. Findings are reported from microanalyses of enactive, vicarious, and emotive modes of treatment that support the hypothesized relationship between perceived self-efficacy and behavioral changes.

Immersive virtual environments versus traditional platforms: Effects of violent and nonviolent video game play,"An experiment focused on the effects of platform (desktop computer, immersive virtual environment; IVE), content (violent, nonviolent), and player gender on video game play outcomes. Results revealed an interaction such that participants reported higher levels of aggressive feelings when playing a violent video game in an IVE compared to violent game play on a desktop platform or nonviolent game play on either platform. Physiological results supported these findings. No gender effects were found, nor did platform intensify any effects for nonviolent game play. The findings suggest that the intensifying effects of IVEs for game play and aggression are content specific and provide further evidence that attention to playing platform is crucial in understanding violent video game effects.","Persky, S.; Blascovich, J.",Media Psychol.,957
Outcome switching in randomized controlled oncology trials reporting on surrogate endpoints: A cross-sectional analysis,"Inconsistent reporting of clinical trials is well-known in the literature. Despite this, factors associated with poor practice such as outcome switching in clinical trials are poorly understood. We performed a cross-sectional analysis to evaluate the prevalence of, and the factors associated with outcome switching. PubMed and Embase were searched for pharmaceutical randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in oncology reporting on a surrogate primary outcome published in 2015. Outcome switching was present in 18% (39/216). First-author male sex was significantly more likely associated with outcome switching compared to female sex with an OR of 3.05 (95% CI 1.07-8.64, p = 0.04) after multivariable adjustment. For-profit funded RCTs were less likely associated with outcome switching compared to non-profit funded research with an OR of 0.22 (95% CI 0.07-0.74, p = 0.01). First author male sex was more likely associated with outcome switching compared to female sex in drug oncology RCTs reporting on a primary surrogate endpoint. For-profit funded research was less likely associated with outcome switching compared to research funded by non-profit organizations. Furthermore, 18 percent of drug oncology trials reporting on a surrogate endpoint could have a higher risk of false positive results due to primary outcome switching. © 2017 The Author(s).","Falk Delgado, Alberto; Falk Delgado, Anna",Sci.

Attributional thoughts about consumer behavior,"Two fundamental principles from attribution theory were examined for the role they might play in the psychology of the consumer. They are: (1) perceptions of causality along a stability dimension influence the anticipated likelihood of product satisfaction, and (2) perceptions of causality along a controllability dimension influence judgments of responsibility and retributive actions. Comments about the longevity of an attributional framework, methodological recommendations, and the heuristic value of the theory also are included.","Weiner, B.",J. Consum. Res.,959
Charitable Giving: What Influences Donors’ Choice Among Different Causes?,"While the literature is replete with studies that identify factors explaining why people are likely to make monetary contributions, less is known about which particular charitable causes they are likely to choose and how much they donate to them. This article examines donor choice among eight different causes using survey data collected in 2011 for a nationally representative sample in Austria. In particular, the study investigates the role of individual-level factors: subjective dispositions such as empathic concern, trust, and religiosity, and resources such as education and income. We find that subjective dispositions rather predict a donor’s incidence of giving among causes but not the amount donated. Human resources, in contrast, are associated with both the incidence and the amount donated to particular causes, and they also mediate the impact of subjective dispositions. What is more, the study reveals that being asked to donate has the highest explanatory power regarding the incidence of giving among all causes investigated. © 2019, International Society for Third-Sector Research and The Johns Hopkins University.","Neumayr, M.; Handy, F.",Voluntas,960
"Explaining abstinence rates following treatment for alcohol abuse: a quantitative synthesis of patient, research design and treatment effects","We examined the relationships of treatment, patient and research design characteristics to treatment outcome (i.e. abstinence rates) in a sample of 150 treatment conditions drawn from 100 alcohol treatment outcome studies published between 1980 and 1992. Treatment characteristics were related to abstinence rates: more intensive treatments had higher abstinence rates than less intensive treatments, whereas treatments with an expressed goal other than abstinence had lower abstinence rates than treatments with an abstinence goal. When the public vs. private ownership status of the treatment facility was taken into account, the presence of behavioral elements in the treatment condition also was related to higher abstinence rates. Because of inconsistent reporting in primary studies, we assessed the effects of only one patient pre-treatment characteristic; treatment conditions with a higher proportion of socially stable patients had better outcomes. Research design characteristics were also related to abstinence rates. Treatment conditions with shorter follow-ups and treatments drawn from studies that did not use criteria to exclude more impaired subjects had better outcomes. We discuss possible reasons why our findings regarding the effects of treatment intensity and the use of exclusionary criteria differ from those in previous reviews.","Monahan, S C; Finney, J W",Addiction,961
Ostracism increases social susceptibility,"Ostracism, the act of ignoring and excluding, is a universally applied tactic of social control. Individuals who detect ostracism often change their behaviors to be readmitted into the group, even if it means becoming excessively socially susceptible to influence. We tested whether ostracized individuals are more socially susceptible to a subsequent influence attempt. In this study, 65 undergraduates were randomly assigned to a 2 (Inclusion or Ostracism) × 3 (Compliance tactic: foot-in-the door, target request only, door-in-the-face) between-participants design. The participants played Cyberball and were either included or ostracized, and then they were approached with a request to donate money. Despite no differences between the three tactics, ostracism increased compliance across all request types. Our discussion focuses on the implications for ostracism-induced social susceptibility.","Carter-Sowell, A.R.; Chen, Z.; Williams, K.D.",Soc. Influ.,962
Rational self-interest and other orientation in organizational behavior: A critical appraisal and extension of Meglino and Korsgaard (2004),"B. M. Meglino and M. A. Korsgaard (2004; see record 2004-21169-004). argued that rational self-interest varies across individuals and negatively relates to other orientation (OO). OO moderates effects of job characteristics on attitudes, motivation, and helping. Viewing organizations as social dilemmas in which employees face a mixture of competitive and cooperative incentives, the author argues in this article that strength of self-interest links to self-concern (SC), which should be distinguished from OO. SC and OO are orthogonal and unipolar. Implications are that some propositions by Meglino and Korsgaard need to be rewritten in terms of SC or OO, and that SC is predicted to moderate effects of self-related variables (e.g., job characteristics), whereas OO might moderate effects of social variables (e.g., team climate) on satisfaction, motivation, and helping. This also implies that when both SC and OO are strong (weak), individual- and group-level constructs are both (in)valid predictors of satisfaction, motivation, and helping.

Eye spots do not increase altruism in children,"The evolutionary legacy hypothesis proposes that an evolved reciprocity-based psychology affects human behavior in anonymous one-shot interactions when reciprocity is not explicitly possible. Empirical support rests on experiments showing that altruism among adults increases in the presence of stylized eye spots or faces. Such stimuli do not affect material payoffs, but they are assumed to activate a person's reciprocity-based psychology. We identify two versions of the evolutionary legacy hypothesis. The weak hypothesis posits that reputational concerns can generate altruism in the absence of opportunities for a good reputation. The strong hypothesis posits that reputational concerns alone can explain anonymous one-shot altruism, and they can do so specifically in lieu of explanations based on group selection. A number of experimental studies support the weak hypothesis but are merely consistent with the strong hypothesis. To address both the weak and strong hypotheses, we conducted an eye spot experiment with children. Altruism can vary by age or sex in childhood, and under the strong hypothesis this kind of variation should reveal associated variation in sensitivity to eye spots. Although we found significant variation in altruism among children, we found no corresponding variation in sensitivity to eye spots. More generally, we found no eye spot effects of any kind. We discuss the possibility that eye spots might only affect altruism under specific conditions. We further argue that conditional effects do not refute the weak hypothesis in any way, but they do suggest potential limitations on the explanatory scope of the strong hypothesis. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Vogt, S.; Efferson, C.; Berger, J.; Fehr, E.",Evol.

Moral values and increasing stakes in a dictator game,"Using data from a large representative US sample (N = 1519), we compare hypothetical moral fairness values from the Moral Foundations Sacredness Scale with actual fairness behavior in an incentivized dictator game with either low or high stakes. We find that people with high moral fairness values fail to live up to their high fairness standards, when stake size increases. This violates principles from consistency theories according to which moral values are supposedly aligned with moral behavior, but is in line with temptation theories that question the absoluteness of morality values. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Schier, U.K.; Ockenfels, A.; Hofmann, W.",J.

Criteria to Identify a Potential Deceased Organ Donor: A Systematic Review,"OBJECTIVES: To systematically review the global published literature defining a potential deceased organ donor and identifying clinical triggers for deceased organ donation identification and referral. DATA SOURCES: Medline and Embase databases from January 2006 to September 2017. STUDY SELECTION: All published studies containing a definition of a potential deceased organ donor and/or clinical triggers for referring a potential deceased organ donor were eligible for inclusion. Dual, independent screening was conducted of 3,857 citations. DATA EXTRACTION: Data extraction was completed by one team member and verified by a second team member. Thematic content analysis was used to identify clinical criteria for potential deceased organ donation identification from the published definitions and clinical triggers. DATA SYNTHESIS: One hundred twenty-four articles were included in the review. Criteria fell into four categories: Neurological, Medical Decision, Cardiorespiratory, and Administrative. Distinct and globally consistent sets of clinical criteria by type of deceased organ donation (neurologic death determination, controlled donation after circulatory determination of death, and uncontrolled donation after circulatory determination of death) are reported. CONCLUSIONS: Use of the clinical criteria sets reported will reduce ambiguity associated with the deceased organ donor identification and the subsequent referral process, potentially reducing the number of missed donors and saving lives globally through increased transplantation.","Squires, Janet E; Coughlin, Mary; Dorrance, Kristin; Linklater, Stefanie; Chassé, Michaël; Grimshaw, Jeremy M; Shemie, Sam D; Dhanani, Sonny; Knoll, Gregory A",Crit.

A Systematic Review of Fatalities Related to Acute Ingestion of Salt. A Need for Warning Labels?,"There are sporadic cases of fatalities from acutely eating salt. Yet, on social media, there are ""challenges to"" and examples of children and some adults acutely eating salt, and recently a charity advocated eating small amounts of salt to empathize with Syrian refugees. We performed a systematic review of fatalities from ingesting salt to assess if relatively moderate doses of salt could be fatal. In 27 reports, there were 35 fatalities documented (19 in adults and 16 in children). The lethal dose was estimated to be less than 10 g of sodium (<5 teaspoons of salt) in two children, and less than 25 g sodium in four adults (<4 tablespoons of salt). The frequency of fatal ingestion of salt is not able to be discerned from our review. If investigation of the causes of hypernatremia in hospital records indicates salt overdose is relatively common, consideration could be given to placing warning labels on salt containers and shakers. Such warning labels can have the added advantage of reducing dietary salt consumption.","Campbell, Norm R C; Train, Emma J",Nutrients,967
Diversification of revenue strategies: Evolving resource dependence in nonprofit organizations,"This article examines the effects of three major revenue strategies in nonprofit organizations. Evolving resource dependence is demonstrated by the shifting reliance on each source of funds: private contributions, government funding, and commercial activities. A wide-ranging literature review is condensed into summary profiles comparing revenue volatility, goal displacement, process, and structure effects of each strategy. The profiles are drawn upon to anticipate potential advantages and disadvantages of increasingly diversified revenue strategies employed by nonprofits to combat resource dependence. The potential interaction effects raise critical but unanswered questions about nonprofit performance, legitimacy, and public policy issues.","Froelich, K.A.",Nonprofit Volunt. Sect. Q.,968

The crowding-out effect within government funding: Implications for within-source diversification,"The benefits and risks of revenue diversification lead scholars to propose within-source diversification as a possible compromise. Although this revenue strategy sounds promising, no scholarly attention has been devoted to empirically examining it. This study explores within-source diversification across government funding, specifically whether nonprofit receipt of support from a major government funder affects support from other government funders. Using a panel dataset of U.S.-based international development nonprofits from 1995 to 2014, we find that nonprofits with more funding from the major funder are associated with significantly less funding from other funders. This crowding-out effect weakens as organization size grows. The findings imply that the within-source diversification strategy might be more desirable for larger organizations with the capacity to manage multiple funding relationships. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Zhao, J.; Lu, J.",Nonprofit Manage.

"Foreign Aid, Government Spending, and Contributions toward Public Goods: Experimental Evidence from the Philippines","Scholars have long argued that government spending crowds out contributions to public goods through taxes or through nonprofit organizations. In developing countries where public goods are often financed by foreign donors, foreign aid may have a similar inhibiting effect. Aid, it is argued, leads citizens to question the legitimacy of their state and reduces their willingness to comply with taxes. Recent studies show that externally funded non-government organizations and programs fail to catalyze collective action as expected. Bringing together these strands of research, we examine whether information on government and/or foreign financing crowds out willingness to contribute to public goods, and explore mechanisms linking the information and individuals’ responses. Using a survey experiment on elite university students in the Philippines, we find that both government spending and foreign aid reduce willingness to contribute to the public good, albeit not uniformly across different modes of engagement. Moreover, we find that individuals are likely to reduce their contributions, not because they view government and foreign financing as perfect substitutes for their contributions, as the classic crowding out thesis suggests, but because they have little confidence that existing resources will be properly disbursed. Our results point to a general lack of confidence in the state as well as other intermediary institutions involved in the implementation of government and aid programs. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Montinola, G.R.; Taylor, T.W.; Largoza, G.L.",Stud.

The Function of Eyespot Patterns in the Lepidoptera,"1. Lepidoptera belonging to several different families bear eyespot patterns on their wings, often with a very strong resemblance to the vertebrate eye. These have been derived from different morphological structures in different groups, and their evolution is therefore convergent within the order. 2. A study of two individual hand-reared Yellow Buntings has shown that the pursuit of flying insect prey is fully released at the bird's first encounter with a flying butterfly, but that the orientation of the attack is modified by experience. 3. Eyespot patterns are associated with displays which exhibit them. In the case of a Nymphalid butterfly, Nymphalis io, an experiment has shown that the display releases escape responses from Yellow Buntings, and that the major part of this effect is due to the four ocelli on the upper surface of the fore- and hind wings. Experiments with other species of insects suggest that other factors contributing include the bright field of colour surrounding the eyespots, the rhythmic movements of the display, and the rustling noise which accompanies it. The bird's responses to this display waned rapidly in the majority of individuals, but some birds became conditioned to avoid the butterflies altogether. 4. Experiments with models showed that circular patterns presented suddenly to feeding birds (Chaffinches, Yellow Buntings and Great Tits) release escape responses more effectively than do non-circular patterns of the same area and perimeter. An increase in the perimeter of the models, achieved by the use of three concentric circles of the same area as the single circle, increased its releasing value. A flat, eye-like pattern which was so shaded and distorted as to appear three-dimensional was more effective than a similar flat pattern which was not shaded, and hence was more bright. Large models were more effective than similar small ones. Waning was again rapid. The differential responsiveness to circular and non-circular patterns is inborn in the case of Great Tits and Chaffinches. 5. An experiment with mealworms artifically ornamented with small eye-like spots at their extremities has shown that such markings, placed on a prey-object, tend to direct to themselves the attack of Yellow Buntings. The waning of the element of disturbed orientation in the responses is slow, and may not be significant. 6. The deflection and intimidation effects are discussed. The origin of the predator's responses to deflection marks is not known, but it is suggested that intimidating eyespots act by mimicking the eyes of the large avian predators preying on the small insectivorous passerines which are among their natural enemies. It has been shown that many small passerines possess inborn responses to their predators, and it is probable that these are ""parasitised"" by the eyespot patterns of insects. Eyespot patterns must be regarded as wholly distinct from pseudaposematic colouration. The effect of experience on small passerines, either of the predator-model or of an ocellated imitator, is most usually the reverse of that sustained by a predator encountering the model or mimic in a true case of Batesian or Mullerian mimicry, and the restrictions on the population size of a pseudaposematic insect relative to its model do not apply to insects utilising the inborn responses of their predators.","Blest, A.D.",Behaviour,972

Cognitive load and cooperation,"We study the effect of intuitive and reflective processes on cooperation using cognitive load. Compared with time constraint, which has been used in the previous literature, cognitive load is a more direct way to block reflective processes, and thus a more suitable way to study the link between intuition and cooperation. Using a repeated public goods game, we study the effect of different levels of cognitive load on contributions. We show that a higher cognitive load increases the initial level of cooperation. In particular, subjects are significantly less likely to fully free ride under high cognitive load. © 2017 F. Døssing, M. Piovesan and E. Wengström.","Døssing, F.; Piovesan, M.; Wengström, E.",Crit.

Light in Darkness: Low Self-Control Promotes Altruism in Crises,"People struggle regularly with the selfish impulse to maximize personal benefits and the prosocial impulse to care for others. However, little is known about how people naturally react in crises. We propose that people with lowered state self-control are more inclined to help in crisis situations. Four studies showed that individuals with lower self-control (both measured and manipulated) were more likely to help, share, and volunteer in high-crisis scenarios (Studies 1, 2, and 3b) and in an earthquake simulation (Study 4). The results were not merely a semantic priming effect of crisis descriptions (Study 3a). This research suggests that people naturally have different altruistic tendencies when faced with a crisis versus everyday situations. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Wang, Y.; Zhang, X.; Li, J.; Xie, X.",Basic Appl.

Social Presence Diminishes Contagious Yawning in the Laboratory,"Contagious yawning may be a useful measure of social psychological functioning, and thus it is important to evaluate the variables influencing its expression in laboratory settings. Previous research has documented that humans yawn less frequently in crowded environments and when under direct observation, but the impact of social presence on contagious yawning remains unknown. Here we present the first study to systematically alter the degree of social presence experienced by participants in the laboratory to determine its effect on contagious yawning frequency. Our results demonstrate that both implied and actual social presence significantly diminish yawn contagion in comparison to a control condition, indicating a key social component to contagious yawning. These findings provide a framework for pursuing additional research investigating the social factors influencing contagious yawning, while also offering applications for measuring this response in laboratory settings.","Gallup, A.; Church, A.M.; Miller, H.; Risko, E.F.; Kingstone, A.",Sci.

Tolerant indirect reciprocity can boost social welfare through solidarity with unconditional cooperators in private monitoring,"Indirect reciprocity is an important mechanism for resolving social dilemmas. Previous studies explore several types of assessment rules that are evolutionarily stable for keeping cooperation regimes. However, little is known about the effects of private information on social systems. Most indirect reciprocity studies assume public monitoring in which individuals share a single assessment for each individual. Here, we consider a private monitoring system that loosens such an unnatural assumption. We explore the stable norms in the private system using an individual-based simulation. We have three main findings. First, narrow and unstable cooperation: cooperation in private monitoring becomes unstable and the restricted norms cannot maintain cooperative regimes while they can in public monitoring. Second, stable coexistence of discriminators and unconditional cooperators: under private monitoring, unconditional cooperation can play a role in keeping a high level of cooperation in tolerant norm situations. Finally, Pareto improvement: private monitoring can achieve a higher cooperation rate than does public monitoring. © 2017 The Author(s).","Okada, I.; Sasaki, T.; Nakai, Y.",Sci. Rep.,981
Effects of Prosocial Video Games on Prosocial Behavior,"Previous research has documented that playing violent video games has various negative effects on social behavior in that it causes an increase in aggressive behavior and a decrease in prosocial behavior. In contrast, there has been much less evidence on the effects of prosocial video games. In the present research, 4 experiments examined the hypothesis that playing a prosocial (relative to a neutral) video game increases helping behavior. In fact, participants who had played a prosocial video game were more likely to help after a mishap, were more willing (and devoted more time) to assist in further experiments, and intervened more often in a harassment situation. Results further showed that exposure to prosocial video games activated the accessibility of prosocial thoughts, which in turn promoted prosocial behavior. Thus, depending on the content of the video game, playing video games not only has negative effects on social behavior but has positive effects as well. © 2010 American Psychological Association.","Greitemeyer, T.; Osswald, S.",J.

What factors predict drivers’ self-reported lane change violation behavior at urban intersections? A study in China,"Lane change violations are a major cause of traffic conflicts and accidents at urban intersections and one of many road-safety issues in China. This study aims to explore the socio-psychological factors underlying drivers’ motivation for lane change violation behavior at urban intersections and examines how these factors predict this violation behavior. A self-reported questionnaire is designed by applying the construct of the theory of planned behavior (TPB) to collect data. Five hundred-six valid responses are received from the questionnaire survey conducted on the Internet in China. The data are then analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM). The results of the analysis show that behavioral intention is the strongest predictor of self-reported lane change violation behavior at urban intersections. Perceived behavioral control has both direct and indirect effects on self-reported lane change violation behavior. Furthermore, attitude, subjective norms and perceived behavioral control are found to have significant correlations with drivers’ intention of lane change violations at urban intersections. The results of this study could provide a reference for designing more effective interventions to modify drivers’ lane change violation behavior at urban intersections. © 2019 Wang et al.

The evolution of trust and trustworthiness,"Trust and trustworthiness form the basis for continued social and economic interactions, and they are also fundamental for cooperation, fairness, honesty, and indeed for many other forms of prosocial and moral behaviour. However, trust entails risks, and building a trustworthy reputation requires effort. So how did trust and trustworthiness evolve, and under which conditions do they thrive? To find answers, we operationalize trust and trustworthiness using the trust game with the trustor's investment and the trustee's return of the investment as the two key parameters. We study this game on different networks, including the complete network, random and scale-free networks, and in the well-mixed limit. We show that in all but one case, the network structure has little effect on the evolution of trust and trustworthiness. Specifically, for well-mixed populations, lattices, random and scale-free networks, we find that trust never evolves, while trustworthiness evolves with some probability depending on the game parameters and the updating dynamics. Only for the scale-free network with degree non-normalized dynamics, we find parameter values for which trust evolves but trustworthiness does not, as well as values for which both trust and trustworthiness evolve. We conclude with a discussion about mechanisms that could lead to the evolution of trust and outline directions for future work. © 2020 The Author(s).","Kumar, A.; Capraro, V.; Perc, M.",J. R. Soc.

His study comprises a literature survey, a model of the donor-fundraiser relation, and finally, an econometric analysis of the impact of fundraising on giving behaviour. The survey introduces theoretical approaches to donor motivation, groups them according to their central assumptions, and assesses their empirical relevance. The theoretical analysis takes for granted that fundraising is an integral part of the giving process, and models the potential conflict concerning the amount of fundraising exerted. Fundraising typically displays an ambiguous effect on donor utility. The empirical analysis employs two extensive datasets to investigate this complex donor-fundraiser relation, while establishing a convincing link of donor-level data to non-profit financial data. © 2014 Springer Fachmedien Wiesbaden.

"Cognitive reflection, 2D:4D and social value orientation","The current study seeks confirmation for the hypothesis that 2D:4D (positively) predicts prosociality when people are more likely to rely on intuition than deliberation. We assess intuition and deliberation using the Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT) and measure prosociality via the validated Social Value Orientation (SVO) slider measure. Although our results do not provide collective evidence for our main proposition, we observe in the data that for low (right) 2D:4D men, the more intuitive they are, the less prosocial they become, whereas for high (right) 2D:4D men the thinking style does not affect their prosociality. Importantly, we find that two alternative measures of cognitive reflection, CRT and CRT-2, differently relate to prosocial decision making such that only CRT-2 (but not the classic CRT) positively predicts prosociality. Given that previous research on the role of cognitive reflection and 2D:4D in prosocial decision making provided inconsistent results, the present study findings are highly valuable to get a better understanding in this domain of study. Furthermore, some of our findings invite further confirmatory tests, thereby opening up multiple avenues for further research. © 2019 Millet, Aydinli.

"A Note on the Ultimatum Paradox, Bounded Rationality, and Uncertainty","The ultimatum game is a sequential-move bargaining game in which a giver offers a taker a share of a monetary pie. The predicted subgame perfect equilibrium in the ultimatum game is for purely rational givers who act in their own narrow self-interest to offer the smallest possible share of a monetary price, and for purely rational takers to accept. Experimental trials suggest, however, that givers make generous offers because they have a taste for fairness. The analysis presented in this paper argues that it is in the best interest of givers of any type to make offers that will not be rejected, and that offers become more generous as a giver's uncertainty about the taker's reservation offer increases. © 2012 International Atlantic Economic Society.","Webster, T.J.",Int.

Effects of eye images and norm cues on charitable donation: A dield experiment in an izakaya,"Laboratory and field experiments have shown that people are more likely to be prosocial in the presence of watching eyes images. This ''watching eyes effect'' may be explained by the reputation-based partner choice model or a norm-compliance model suggesting that eye images elicit conformity to locally specific behavioral norms. A previous laboratory study that investigated the effects of local norms on charitable donations by using watching eye images and manipulating money visible in a collection box found that the presence of eye images significantly increased overall donations; however, the images did not make people more likely to conform to the apparent local norm. Here, we report the results of a field study examining the effects of watching eyes and the amount of money in transparent collection boxes on charitable giving in an izakaya (a Japanese-style tavern) setting. Contrary to the previous study, we found that the amount donated increased more under the large- than the small-norm treatment. The presence of eye images increased the overall amount donated but was more salient under the small-norm treatment. We found that participants were more likely to increase the amount of money in the box than to conform to the local norm of a small donation when the eye images were present. The results of this study suggest that an appropriate combination of eye images and normative information can alter people's behavior without changing their economic incentives. © The Author(s) 2016.","Oda, R.; Ichihashi, R.",Evol.

A motivational perspective on punishment in social dilemmas,"In social dilemma situations, individuals benefit from uncooperative behaviour while exploiting resources of the collective. One prominent solution to prevent uncooperative behaviour and to increase cooperation is to establish a sanction system in that private resources are invested by individuals to punish uncooperative interaction partners. The present review is intended to provide an overview concerning motivational determinants of punishment in social dilemma situations. Specifically, we (a) outline that fairness concerns and revenge motivate individuals to punish uncooperative other individuals, (b) show that this is done especially when they possess the basic motivational orientation of a prevention focus. We (c) illustrate that individuals do not punish to acquire a good reputation in the eyes of others, and (d) elaborate on whether individuals punish to regulate satisfaction. Finally, we present empirically neglected motivational factors in studies on punishment in social dilemmas and discuss limitations and possible future directions in this field of research. © 2017 European Association of Social Psychology.","Pfattheicher, S.; Keller, J.",Eur.

Oral essential fatty acid supplementation in atopic dermatitis: a meta-analysis of placebo-controlled trials,"There was no evidence that EFA supplements improve AD. The treatment may be successful in subgroups such as young children, but there was insufficient evidence to assess this. XCM: The review question was clear in terms of the study design, intervention and participants. Three databases were searched and attempts were made to minimise language bias. No attempt was made to locate unpublished studies, thus raising the possibility of the omission of relevant data and publication bias. However, the reviewers did assess the potential for publication bias. The methods used to select the studies were not described, so it is not known whether any efforts were made to reduce errors and bias; methods were used to minimise bias in the validity assessment and some of the data extraction. Validity was assessed using established criteria, and some additional methodological limitations of the included studies were discussed in the text of the review.Adequate information on the included studies was presented. Studies reporting adequate data were combined in a meta-analysis and meta-analysis graphs were presented for GLA studies. The influence of various factors on the results was explored.

Crowding Out and Crowding In of Private Donations and Government Grants,"A large literature examines the interaction of private and public funding of charities, much of it testing if public funding crowds out private funding. In this article, the author looks for two alternative phenomena using a large panel data set gathered from nonprofit organizations' tax returns. First, the author looks for crowding out in the opposite direction: increased private funding may cause reduced public funding. Second, the author tests whether one type of funding acts as a signal of charity quality and thus crowds in other funding. The author finds evidence that government grants crowd in private donations. Crowding in is larger for younger charities. This is consistent with signaling, if donors know less about younger charities and the signal value is stronger. The author finds no evidence of an effect of private donations on government grants. © The Author(s) 2012.","Heutel, G.",Public Financ. Rev.,995
Eyes wide open: Only eyes that pay attention promote prosocial behavior,"Research from evolutionary psychology suggests that the mere presence of eye images can promote prosocial behavior. However, the ""eye images effect"" is a source of considerable debate, and findings across studies have yielded somewhat inconsistent support. We suggest that one critical factor may be whether the eyes really need to be watching to effectively enhance prosocial behavior. In three experiments, we investigated the impact of eye images on prosocial behavior, assessed in a laboratory setting. Participants were randomly assigned to view an image of watching eyes (eyes with direct gaze), an image of nonwatching eyes (i.e., eyes closed for Study 1 and averted eyes for Studies 2 and 3), or an image of flowers (control condition). Upon exposure to the stimuli, participants decided whether or not to help another participant by completing a dull cognitive task. Three independent studies produced somewhat mixed results. However, combined analysis of all three studies, with a total of 612 participants, showed that the watching component of the eyes is important for decision-making in this context. Images of watching eyes led to significantly greater inclination to offer help as compared to images of nonwatching eyes (i.e., eyes closed and averted eyes) or images of flowers. These findings suggest that eyes gazing at an individual, rather than any proxy to social presence (e.g., just the eyes), serve as a reminder of reputation. Taken together, we conclude that it is ""eyes that pay attention"" that can lift the veil of anonymity and potentially facilitate prosocial behavior. © The Author(s) 2016.","Manesi, Z.; Van Lange, P.A.M.; Pollet, T.V.",Evol.

"Effects of prosocial lyrics and musical production elements on emotions, thoughts and behavior","Popular music with prosocial lyrics affects listeners’ thoughts, emotions and behavior, yet little is known about the role played by the actual music in this process. This study focused on the interaction between the prosocial lyrics and the musical production elements, examining whether certain versions of a song can enhance the effect of prosocial lyrics on thoughts, emotions and behavior. Based on the general learning model and the reciprocal-feedback model of music perception, a laboratory experiment (N = 136) was conducted to test how listeners are affected by music with prosocial or neutral lyrics and by an electronic or an unplugged version of the music. For this purpose, an original song was composed and produced, using the same melodies and harmonies with varied lyrics and instrumentation. In a pilot study (n = 36), a version with acoustic instrumentation was rated as the most emotional and fitting, whereas an electronic dance version was rated as the least emotional and fitting. There was a significant interaction effect between the lyrics and the musical production elements: Those listening to the unplugged version with prosocial lyrics showed the most empathetic emotions. Prosocial lyrics also had an effect on prosocial thoughts but not on behavior. © The Author(s) 2020.","Ruth, N.; Schramm, H.",Psychol. Music,997
"Knowing what I should, doing what I want: From selfishness to inequity aversion in young children's sharing behavior","The social utility model suggests that people feel more satisfied with equal divisions of resources than from inequitable outcomes, even when the latter favors oneself. Research examining children's behavior has shown that the tendency to share half of one's endowment increases with age between the ages of 3 and 8. However, the satisfaction the children derive from their decisions (to share half of their endowments) has yet to be examined. I present two studies (using the dictator and ultimatum games) suggesting that young children (5-6. years old) are aware of the norms of fairness but choose to act selfishly and prefer not to share. Slightly older children aged 7-8 adopt these norms in their actual behavior but do not feel happier when they share half of their endowments than when they share less than half. Finally, true inequity aversion only appears at the ages of 9-10, when children not only give more, but they correspondingly also feel better when their endowments are equally divided. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Kogut, T.",J.

The Pique Then Reframe Technique: Replication and Extension of the Pique Technique,"This study examined the pique technique associated with a reframing sentence. Passersby in the street were asked for money, either for a common amount of change (control) or 37 cents (pique technique). In half of the cases, the requester added a direct reframing sentence at the end of the request. Results showed that the pique technique increased compliance with the request. Adding a reframing sentence to the pique did not increase compliance rate with the request but increased the amount of money given by the participants. These results support the theoretical explanation that a reframing sentence could reduce the influence of the script of refusal activated by the money request. © 2015, © 2015 Eastern Communication Association.","Guéguen, N.; Meineri, S.; Pascual, A.; Girandola, F.",Commun.

Are women the more empathetic gender? The effects of gender role expectations,"The present research aimed to extend the state of knowledge regarding the relationship between self-perceived empathy and traditional gender roles and placed particular focus on the contextual conditions under which gender differences in empathy are present, can be created, or eliminated. Across two studies, women rated themselves higher in empathy than men in all experimental conditions, whereas an objective female superiority in emotion recognition was only evident in one condition. In Study 1 (n = 736), using the term ‘social-analytic capacity’ instead of ‘empathic capacity’ increased gender differences in self-reported empathy and resulted in women performing better in the Eyes-test than men. In a neutral task (verbal intelligence), gender differences (in this case, a male superiority), were only found when participants believed that this task had an association with empathy. In Study 2 (n = 701), gender differences in self-reported empathic capacity, but not in performance in emotion recognition, increased when motivation for empathy was raised. Further, gender-role orientation mediated the association between gender and self-reported empathic capacity, whereas it did not account for the association between gender and emotion recognition. Overall, the present studies provide strong support for the idea that empathy is influenced by contextual factors and can be systematically biased by gender roles and stereotypical beliefs. © 2021, The Author(s).","Löffler, C.S.; Greitemeyer, T.",Curr.

"Public goods provision, inequality and taxes","The impact of redistributive policies on voluntary contributions is still not well understood. While a higher level of redistributive taxation decreases the price of voluntary giving, it also changes the income distribution by decreasing income inequality. This paper provides a controlled laboratory experiment to investigate the net impact of the tax rate on public goods provision. The experimental findings show that while the participants decrease their voluntary contributions as the pre-tax income distribution becomes more equal, they increase their contributions with taxation.

"Models of caring, or acting as if one cared, about the welfare of others","This article surveys the theoretical literature in which people are modeled as taking other peoples payoffs into account either because this affects their utility directly or because they wish to impress others with their social-mindedness. Key experimental results that bear on the relevance of these theories are discussed as well. Five types of models are considered. In the first, an individuals utility function is increasing in the payoffs of other people. The more standard version of these preferences supposes that only consumption leads to payoffs and has trouble explaining prosocial actions such as voting and charitable contributions by poor individuals. If one lets other variables determine happiness as well, this model can explain a much wider set of observations. The second type of model surveyed involves people trying to demonstrate to others that they have prosocial (or altruistic) preferences. In these models, altruistic acts need not have a direct effect on utility. The third class of models includes those of reciprocity in which peoples altruism depends on whether others act kindly or unkindly toward them. In the fourth type of model, inequality has a profound effect on altruism, with individuals being spiteful toward people whose resources exceed their own. Finally, I discuss the fifth type of model, in which specifications of altruism might have to be modified to take into account how people behave when they are able to transfer lotteries to others. © 2014 by Annual Reviews.

Little Dictators: A Developmental Meta-analysis of Prosocial Behavior,"Using the dictator game as a measure of prosocial behavior, we combined data from developmental studies from 14 different sites around the world (N = 1,601). We fitted several growth models to the developmental trajectories that varied in their complexity and levels of prosociality. The rationale we used here assumes we can infer something about where all children start on a generous-selfish continuum by looking at the shape of developmental change. We found the model that best explained the variation in developmental trajectories began with a sharing value of ~15%, more toward the selfish end of the spectrum. We also found tentative evidence that the rate at which these prosocial attitudes develop is dependent on the norm of the society. Essentially, if the adult-sharing norm is higher, as it is in non-Western societies, then the child needs to develop at a quicker rate to reach this norm by adulthood. Results are discussed with reference to whether the history of human evolution has left the content of a norm underspecified while leaving the cognitive architecture in place to acquire it?a process that we argue is analogous to imprinting.","Ibbotson, Paul",Curr.

Regard for reason in the moral mind,"The burgeoning science of ethics has produced a trend toward pessimism. Ordinary moral judgment and motivation, we’re told, are profoundly influenced by arbitrary factors and ultimately driven by unreasoned feelings or emotions-fertile ground for sweeping debunking arguments. This book counters the current orthodoxy on its own terms by carefully engaging with the empirical literature. The resulting view, optimistic rationalism, maintains that reason plays a pervasive role in our moral minds and that ordinary moral reasoning is not particularly flawed or in need of serious repair. The science does suggest that moral knowledge and virtue don’t come easily, as we are susceptible to some unsavory influences that lead to rationalizing bad behavior. Reason can be corrupted in ethics just as in other domains, but the science warrants cautious optimism, not a special skepticism about morality in particular. Rationality in ethics is possible not just despite, but in virtue of, the psychological and evolutionary mechanisms that shape moral cognition. © Joshua May 2018.","May, J.",Regard for Reason in the Moral Mind,1006

The variability of individual charitable giving in the US,"Using five-year panel data, this study examines the various dimensions of the variability of individual charitable contributions at all income levels: the variation in the generosity of individuals and the variability of the individuals' giving over a five-year period. The study finds considerable variability of both kinds. One finding is that the variability of generosity is substantially greater at the higher income levels. Another finding is that variability is substantially less pronounced by observing a five-year period of an individual's generosity than by observing annual behaviour. One consequence is that a relatively small proportion of donors account for a large proportion of total giving. The popular reputation of the wealthy for generosity is actually due to the exceptional generosity of a minority rather than widespread generosity among the wealthy. Differences in generosity and variability of giving over time are both more pronounced among high-income donors. Results of the study have implications for research on charitable giving, for predicting the effects of tax policy changes on giving, and for fund-raising. © 1990 Charities Aid Foundation.","Auten, G.; Rudney, G.",Voluntas,1008

Gender differences in the trade-off between objective equality and efficiency,"Generations of social scientists have explored whether males and females act differently in domains involving competition, risk taking, cooperation, altruism, honesty, as well as many others. Yet, little is known about gender differences in the trade-off between objective equality (i.e., equality of outcomes) and efficiency. It has been suggested that females are more equal than males, but the empirical evidence is relatively weak. This gap is particularly important, because people in power of redistributing resources often face a conflict between equality and efficiency. The recently introduced Trade-Off Game (TOG) – in which a decision-maker has to unilaterally choose between being equal or being efficient – offers a unique opportunity to fill this gap. To this end, I analyse gender differences on a large dataset including N=6,955 TOG decisions. The results show that females prefer objective equality over efficiency to a greater extent than males do. The effect turns out to be particularly strong when the TOG available options are “morally” framed in such a way to suggest that choosing the equal option is the right thing to do. © 2020 Global Research Online.

Negative pressure wound therapy: a vacuum of evidence?,"There was some suggestion that negative pressure wound therapy may improve wound healing in comparison with conventional therapy, but further well-designed studies are required to prove an additional clinical benefit. XCM: This review assessed a clear research question. Numerous sources were searched for both unpublished and published studies, with no language restrictions, so the risk of publication and language bias appeared low. However, the authors suggested that there was a risk of publication bias due to the large number of ongoing trials, prematurely terminated trials and unpublished trials. The risk of reviewer error and bias also appeared low as multiple reviewers assessed the studies for inclusion and extracted the study data and assessed study validity. The validity of the included studies was assessed, but the overall quality was poor, so the data included in the review may not be reliable. There appeared to be numerous differences between the included studies, particularly with respect to the definition of outcome measures and patient populations. In some cases this precluded the pooling of study data. These limitations were also acknowledged by the authors.Despite these limitations, the authors' cautious conclusions appear appropriate and adequately consider the paucity of data, differences between the studies and poor quality of the studies.

Factors modifying the efficacy of transcranial magnetic stimulation in the treatment of depression: a review,"OBJECTIVE: So far no convincing answer has emerged to the question of whether transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) can make a clinically useful contribution to the treatment of depression. Here we examine whether multiple sensitivity analyses can highlight parameters that predict a favorable treatment response. DATA SOURCES: Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane database for controlled trials were searched for relevant randomized controlled trials using the expression (transcranial magnetic stimulation or TMS) and depression. STUDY SELECTION: Thirty-three studies were identified and included in the random-effects meta-analysis, and between 17 and 31 studies were included in the secondary analyses comparing outcome of studies with different parameters. DATA EXTRACTION: Study data were extracted with a standardized data sheet. A meta-analysis based on Cohen d effect size measure was done for all studies and various subsets. Regression analysis of effect sizes with study parameters was done in 24 studies. DATA SYNTHESIS: Active TMS treatment was more effective than sham, but variability was too great to take any single study design as paradigmatic. No significant predictors of study effect size were found. Mean effect sizes were reduced, although still significant, in studies with stimulation intensity below 90% of motor threshold and new medication starting within 7 days before to 7 days after start of TMS. CONCLUSIONS: The absence of significant outcome predictors in the presence of significant variability of outcome measures can be interpreted in 2 ways: either study sizes and numbers and designs are insufficient to afford the power necessary to detect such predictors or TMS has a nonspecific effect on depression that is not influenced by study parameters. Large-scale comparative trials are necessary to decide between these interpretations.","Herrmann, Lucie L; Ebmeier, Klaus P",J. Clin. Psychiatry,1015
Audit value and charitable organizations,"I examine whether donors favor charities that use high quality auditors and whether the propensity to donate varies directly with audit quality. I find that audit quality affects donor decisions in the market for contributions. From a signaling perspective, charities benefit simply from engaging a higher quality auditor. From an information perspective, donors are more sensitive to changes in reported accounting information verified by a high quality auditor. I also find that, after conditioning on the charity's reputation, donors are still willing to give more to charities aligned with a quality auditor, but the effect of audit quality choice dissipates with the size of the charity. Thus, a charity's reputation and the choice of auditor are substitute mechanisms for signaling the credibility of financial information to donors. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Government Funding of Private Voluntary Organizations: Is There a Crowding-Out Effect?,"Private voluntary organizations (PVOs) are pivotal partners for the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) in implementing U.S. development projects abroad. Using PVO-level panel data from 1947 to 2005, this study shows that when government funding is up to a third of total PVO revenues (depending on the model), it attracts additional private donations; beyond that level, however, it displaces funding from private sources. The crowding-out effect occurs at lower levels of government funding for secular than for religious nonprofits. The results also demonstrate that while donors do not contribute to PVOs based on information about organizational efficiency, organizational age is positively correlated with private donations. U.S. donors are sensitive to government funding from both national and international sources, meanwhile. The results are robust to alternative specifications and a panel mortality correction. © The Author(s) 2014.","Nikolova, M.",Nonprofit Volunt. Sect. Q.,1017
Measuring the effect of federal research funding on private donations at research universities: Is federal research funding more than a substitute for private donations?,"The nature of federal research funding has changed in the United States over the last 30 years. In part, federal research funding has changed in the distribution of funding across disciplines and across universities. Federal funding to universities with historically low levels of funding has also experienced greater growth than those universities with historically high levels of funding. In addition, universities have become more involved in the political process with respect to the allocation of funding for higher education. As the nature of government funding changes, this paper questions its effect on private donations to research and non-research universities. The general presumption of much of the existing theoretical work is that government and private funding for charitable goods are substitutes. Limited evidence exists to suggest, in some circumstances, there may be a positive correlation between these two sources of funding. Potentially, because the government undertakes the expense to gather information about the research universities, and engages in such activities as peer-review of research proposals, the government through its grant awards may provide a signal of quality of research or other information to donors that is less noisy than that available to private donors. Similarly, there may be other types of spillover effects from research funding to private donations. In this case, a change in government grants has both a positive and negative effect on private donations, suggesting a positive correlation between private and public donations if the effect from the dissemination of information is greater than the substitution effect of government grants. I examine data for private and public universities in the United States to measure the relationship between private and public donations under a fixed-effects OLS regression. I explore issues of bias from endogeneity or omitted variables and report the results from a two stage least squares regression in which I use a set of measures that affect federal research funding but not private donations. Regardless of the specification, the results suggest private and public donations are positively correlated for research universities and negatively correlated for non-research institutions. On average, increasing federal research funding by one dollar increases private donations by 65 cents at research universities, decreases private donations by 9 cents at universities whose highest degree granted is a masters, and decreases private donations by 45 cents at liberal arts colleges.","Payne, A.A.",Int.

"Push, don't nudge: Behavioral spillovers and policy instruments","Policy interventions are generally evaluated for their direct effectiveness. Little is known about their ability to persist over time and spill across contexts. These latter aspects can reinforce or offset the direct impacts depending on the policy instrument choice. Through an online experiment with 1486 subjects, we compare four widely used policy instruments in terms of their ability to enforce a norm of fairness in the Dictator Game, and to persist over time (i.e., to a subsequent untreated Dictator Game) or spill over to a norm of cooperation (i.e., to a subsequent Prisoner's Dilemma). As specific policy interventions, we employed two instances of nudges: defaults and social information; and two instances of push measures: rebates and a minimum donation rule. Our results show that (i) rebates, the minimum donation rule and social information have a positive direct effect on fairness, although the effect of social information is only marginally significant, and that (ii) the effect of rebates and the minimum donation rule persists in the second game, but only within the same game type. These findings demonstrate that, within our specific design, push measures are more effective than nudges in promoting fairness. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","d'Adda, G.; Capraro, V.; Tavoni, M.",Econ.

Does observability amplify sensitivity to moral frames? Evaluating a reputation-based account of moral preferences,"A growing body of work suggests that people are sensitive to moral framing in economic games involving prosociality, suggesting that people hold moral preferences for doing the “right thing”. What gives rise to these preferences? Here, we evaluate the explanatory power of a reputation-based account, which proposes that people respond to moral frames because they are motivated to look good in the eyes of others. Across four pre-registered experiments (total N = 9601), we investigated whether reputational incentives amplify sensitivity to framing effects. Studies 1–3 manipulated (i) whether moral or neutral framing was used to describe a Trade-Off Game (in which participants chose between prioritizing equality or efficiency) and (ii) whether Trade-Off Game choices were observable to a social partner in a subsequent Trust Game. These studies found that observability does not significantly amplify sensitivity to moral framing. Study 4 ruled out the alternative explanation that the observability manipulation from Studies 1–3 is too weak to influence behavior. In Study 4, the same observability manipulation did significantly amplify sensitivity to normative information (about what others see as moral in the Trade-Off Game). Together, these results suggest that moral frames may tap into moral preferences that are relatively deeply internalized, such that the power of moral frames is not strongly enhanced by making the morally-framed behavior observable to others. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Capraro, V.; Jordan, J.J.; Tappin, B.M.",J.

Fatal and non-fatal repetition of self-harm. Systematic review,"BACKGROUND: Non-fatal self-harm frequently leads to non-fatal repetition and sometimes to suicide. We need to quantify these two outcomes of self-harm to help us to develop and test effective interventions. AIMS: To estimate rates of fatal and non-fatal repetition of self-harm. METHOD: A systematic review of published follow-up data, from observational and experimental studies. Four electronic databases were searched and 90 studies met the inclusion criteria. RESULTS: Eighty per cent of studies found were undertaken in Europe, over one-third in the UK. Median proportions for repetition 1 year later were: 16% non-fatal and 2% fatal; after more than 9 years, around 7% of patients had died by suicide. The UK studies found particularly low rates of subsequent suicide. CONCLUSIONS: After 1 year, non-fatal repetition rates are around 15%. The strong connection between self-harm and later suicide lies somewhere between 0.5% and 2% after 1 year and above 5% after 9 years. Suicide risk among self-harm patients is hundreds of times higher than in the general population.","Owens, David; Horrocks, Judith; House, Allan",Br. J. Psychiatry,1022

Revenue diversification in nonprofit organizations: Does it lead to financial stability?,"This article investigates whether revenue diversification leads to greater stability in the revenue structures of nonprofit organizations. Our findings suggest that nonprofits can indeed reduce their revenue volatility through diversification, particularly by equalizing their reliance on earned income, investments, and contributions. This positive effect of diversification on revenue stability implies that a diversified portfolio encourages more stable revenues and consequently could promote greater organizational longevity. Despite any additional complexity or crowding out, nonprofit managers may increase the financial stability of their organizations by adding additional revenue streams. However, our analysis also reveals several other important factors that contribute to nonprofit revenue stability. In particular, increasing a nonprofit organization's total expenses and fund balance reduces volatility, suggesting larger nonprofits and organizations with greater growth potential experience greater revenue stability. Finally, the results suggest nonprofits relying primarily on contributions will experience more volatility, whereas nonprofits located within urban areas will have more stable revenue structures over time.","Carroll, D.A.; Stater, K.J.",J.

Anxiety and social responsiveness moderate the effect of situational demands on children’s donating behavior,"This study examined dispositional and situational correlates of donating behavior in a sample of 221 eight-year-old children. Children were shown a promotional clip for a charity, including a donation call. For a random half of the children, the video fragment ended with a probe of a same-sex peer donating money to the charity. Seeing a peer donate was associated with higher donations. Empathy and inhibition were not related to donating. Anxiety and social responsiveness moderated the effect of the situational manipulation on donating. Anxious children and children with less social responsiveness problems donated more after seeing the donating peer than did less anxious children and children with more social responsiveness problems. Moreover, in absence of the donating peer, anxious children donated less money than did less anxious children. Our results indicate that donating behavior is dependent on situational demands, and the situational effect differs depending on children’s levels of anxiety or social responsiveness. © 2017 by Wayne State University Press, Detroit, MI 48201.","Wildeboer, A.; Thijssen, S.; Bakermans-Kranenburg, M.J.; Jaddoe, V.W.V.; White, T.; Tiemeier, H.; Van Ijzendoorn, M.H.",Merrill-Palmer Q.,1026

The findings show that desires fully mediated the effects of attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioural control and anticipated emotions on intentions- Significantly greater amounts ot variance are explained in intentions and behaviour by the new model in comparison to the TPB and vanriantss of the TPB that includede either anticipated emotions and/or past behaviour.","Perugini, M.; Bagozzi, R.P.",Br.

Does observability affect prosociality?,"The observation of behaviour is a key theoretical parameter underlying anumber of models of prosociality. However, the empirical findings showingthe effect of observability on prosociality are mixed. In thismeta-analysis, we explore the boundary conditions that may account forthis variability, by exploring key theoretical and methodologicalmoderators of this link. We identified 117 papers yielding 134 study leveleffects (total n = 788 164) and found a small but statisticallysignificant, positive association between observability and prosociality(r = 0.141, 95% confidence interval = 0.106, 0.175). Moderator analysisshowed that observability produced stronger effects on prosociality: (i)in the presence of passive observers (i.e. people whose role was to onlyobserve participants) versus perceptions of being watched, (ii) whenparticipants' decisions were consequential (versus non-consequential),(iii) when the studies were performed in the laboratory (as opposed to inthe field/online), (iv) when the studies used repeated measures (insteadof single games), and (v) when the studies involved social dilemmas(instead of bargaining games). These effects show the conditions underwhich observability effects on prosociality will be maximally observed.

The base-rate of hitch-hiking success and its moderators: A meta-analysis,"The inefficient use of automobiles has long become dissonance-provoking for ecologists and financially disadvantaged travellers. Although there are now more than a dozen psychological studies examining hitch-hiking success this is the first meta-analytic summary of the base-rate of hitch-hiking and its moderators. Every study reporting sufficient data to calculate the proportion of cars stopping divided by the amount of cars in total was included regardless of the gender and age of the hitch-hiking confederates and drivers. A random effects approach was used to calculate study weights and resulted in an overall mean proportion of 9.00% (CI=[8.0, 11.0]). Hitch-hikers’ gender and publication type were significant moderators while controlling for country and year. Females, 12.57% CI[10.33, 14.81], had a higher base-rate than males, 5.71% CI[4.49, 6.92], while published studies, 10.30 CI [8.49, 12,11], had a higher base-rate than unpublished studies, 4.56 [2.96, 6.16]. All of the results were stable in the face of Trim and Fill as well as a leave-one-out analysis. Future research should continue to research the factors influencing hitch-hiking success (e.g. hitch-hiking mode: either standing at the side of the road signaling by thumbg/sign or requesting a ride by asking the drivers) while considering the base-rate to compute the necessary sample size. In practice the base-rate provides hitch-hikers a reasonable estimate of their average success, potentially limiting superstitious mannerisms.","Kotz, Fabian",Transp. Res. Part F Traffic Psychol.

Door-in-the-face technique and monetary solicitation: An evaluation in a field setting,"To test the door-in-the-face technique for a private solicitation, 53 men and 37 women in several bars were engaged. In one condition, a female confederate asked the subject to buy her drink because her boyfriend had left without paying the bill. After the subject refused, the confederate requested only 2 or 3 coins. In the control condition, the latter request was the only one. Analysis showed a dramatic increase in compliance for the door-in-the-face condition. A positive effect of the door-in-the-face technique was also observed for the average amount of the donation.

The cost of callousness: Regulating compassion influences the moral self-concept,"It has often been argued that compassion is fundamental to morality. Yet people often suppress compassion for self-interested reasons. We provide evidence that suppressing compassion is not cost free, as it creates dissonance between a person's moral identity and his or her moral principles. We instructed separate groups of participants to regulate their compassion, regulate their feelings of distress, or freely experience emotions toward compassion-inducing images. Participants then reported how central morality was to their identities and how much they believed that moral rules should always be followed. Participants who regulated compassion-but not those who regulated distress or experienced emotions-showed a dissonance-based trade-off. If they reported higher levels of moral identity, they had a greater belief that moral rules could be broken. If they maintained their belief that moral rules should always be followed, they sacrificed their moral identity. Regulating compassion thus has a cost of its own: It forces trade-offs within a person's moral self-concept. © The Author(s) 2012.","Cameron, C.D.; Payne, B.K.",Psychol. Sci.,1032
"Social media, social causes, giving behavior and money contributions","In the present study we examine the effect of online social networks on voluntary engagement, giving behavior and online money contributions. The study is a secondary analysis based on the PEW data set (2008). We draw upon a combination between pro-social theories of voluntary engagement and communication theories of the Internet and show that (a) participation in social media and networking-blogging, Face book and journaling-significantly increase both online, and offline money contributions; (b) social causes moderate the link between socio-demographic characteristics and money contributions. We conclude that social media and networking are an effective means to increase ""ethical consumption"" both online and offline enhancing voluntary engagement and money contributions. These results assess the social diversification hypothesis suggesting that online behavior complements, and in some cases reinforces offline behavior. Differences in the type of affiliated social cause moderate the effects of social media on online pro-social behavior and giving behavior. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Nudged by a robot: Responses to agency and feedback,"The availability of always-on digital agents in hotel rooms, providing agency and surveillance cues, presents opportunities for behavioral interventions. This study tested the effectiveness of agency and social feedback on pro-environmental behavior intention of hotel consumers. A survey with scenario-based experimental design was distributed to US and UK travelers (N = 621). Results suggest that no one type of agent was more effective than the other in influencing pro-environmental behavior intention. Social feedback was found effective when given by a virtual assistant. Perception of another agent being ‘present’ in the room, even when invisible, is sufficient to induce normative behavior.

The effects of altercasting and counterattitudinal behavior on compliance: A lost letter technique investigation,"A field experiment was conducted to test the effectiveness of altercasting (Weinstein & Dutschberger, 1963) as a compliance-gaining technique. The central hypothesis predicts that positive altercasting messages should produce greater compliance than direct requests. Following Milgram's (1969) lost letter technique, 2,400 ostensibly ""lost"" letters were placed on car windshields throughout a metropolitan area along with a business card containing a handwritten altercasting or direct request message to mail the letter. The frequency of letters returned was used as a primary measure of compliance. The results do not demonstrate the effectiveness of altercasting as a compliance-gaining technique; on the contrary, they indicate that negative altercasting significantly reduces compliance. © 2010 Western States Communication Association.","Turner, M.M.; Banas, J.A.; Rains, S.A.; Jang, S.; Moore, J.L.; Morrison, D.",Commun.

Cultural differences in ultimatum game experiments: Evidence from a meta-analysis,"This paper reports the findings of a meta-analysis of 37 papers with 75 results from ultimatum game experiments. We find that on average the proposer offers 40% of the pie to the responder. This share is smaller for larger pie sizes and larger when a strategy method is used or when subjects are inexperienced. On average 16% of the offers is rejected. The rejection rate is lower for larger pie sizes and for larger shares offered. Responders are less willing to accept an offer when the strategy method is employed. As the results come from different countries, meta-analysis provides an alternative way to investigate whether bargaining behavior in ultimatum games differs across countries. We find differences in behavior of responders (and not of proposers) across geographical regions. With one exception, these differences cannot be attributed to various cultural traits on which for instance the cultural classifications of Hofstede (1991) and Inglehart (2000) are based.","Oosterbeek, H.; Sloof, R.; Van De Kuilen, G.",Exp.

Exposure to music with prosocial lyrics reduces aggression: First evidence and test of the underlying mechanism,"Previous research has predominantly focused on negative effects of music exposure by demonstrating that listening to antisocial music increases aggression and aggression-related variables. The present research tests the idea that listening to prosocial (relative to neutral) music decreases aggressive outcomes. In fact, five studies revealed that prosocial music exposure decreased aggressive cognition, affect, and behavior. Mediational analyses showed that the effect of music condition on aggressive behavior was accounted for by differences in aggressive affect. Implications of these results for the predictive validity of the general learning model (Buckley & Anderson, 2006) for the effects of media exposure on social tendencies are discussed. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.","Greitemeyer, T.",J.

Insights from sadness: A three-step model of the development of altruism as hedonism,"Research into the effects of sad mood on prosocial action is reviewed and is used as a vehicle for examining the transformation of altruism from a punishing to a gratifying event. A three-step model of the socialization of altruism as a reinforcer is proposed. The model argues for (a) an initial stage (presocialization) in which altruism occurs rarely among young children because of its punishing function, (b) a second stage (awareness of norms) in which altruism functions as a mechanism for the receipt of positive sanctions, and (c) a final stage (internalization) in which, by adulthood, altruism has acquired a gratifying function through its status as a conditioned reinforcer. Evidence for the functional equivalence of self-gratification and adult altruism is also presented. © 1981.","Cialdini, R.B.; Baumann, D.J.; Kenrick, D.T.",Dev. Rev.,1038

The watching eyes phenomenon: The role of a sense of being seen and public self-awareness,"In recent years, a growing number of researchers have examined the watching eyes phenomenon (i.e., increased prosocial and decreased antisocial behavior when subtle watching eyes are present in the environment). Somewhat surprisingly, the questions of how and under what conditions subtle cues of being watched operate have been unanswered so far. The present contribution addresses this research gap. In two studies, we document that (a) subtle cues of being watched induce a sense of being seen and (b) chronic public self-awareness moderates the watching eyes phenomenon in that specifically individuals with strong chronic public self-awareness show more prosocial behavior under conditions of watching eyes. The applicability of subtle cues of being watched in research on social presence is discussed. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Pfattheicher, S.; Keller, J.",Eur. J. Soc. Psychol.,1041
Butterfly eyespots: Their potential influence on aesthetic preferences and conservation attitudes,"Research has shown that the mere presence of stimuli that resemble eyes is sufficient to attract attention, elicit aesthetic responses, and can even enhance prosocial behavior. However, it is less clear whether eye-like stimuli could also be used as a tool for nature conservation. Several animal species, including butterflies, develop eye-like markings that are known as eyespots. In the present research, we explored whether the mere display of eyespots on butterfly wings can enhance: (a) liking for a butterfly species, and (b) attitudes and behaviors towards conservation of a butterfly species. Four online experimental studies, involving 613 participants, demonstrated that eyespots significantly increased liking for a butterfly species. Furthermore, eyespots significantly increased positive attitudes towards conservation of a butterfly species (Studies 1, 2 and 4), whereas liking mediated the eyespot effect on conservation attitudes (Study 2). However, we also found some mixed evidence for an association between eyespots and actual conservation behavior (Studies 3 and 4). Overall, these findings suggest that eyespots may increase liking for an animal and sensitize humans to conservation. We discuss possible implications for biodiversity conservation and future research directions. © 2015 Manesi et al.

The impact of taxes and wasteful government spending on giving,"We examine how taxes impact charitable giving and how this relationship is affected by the degree of wasteful government spending. In our model, individuals make donations to charities knowing that the government collects a flat-rate tax on income (net of charitable donations) and redistributes part of the tax revenue. The rest of the tax revenue is wasted. The model predicts that a higher tax rate increases charitable donations. Surprisingly, the model shows that a higher degree of waste decreases donations (when the elasticity of marginal utility with respect to consumption is high enough). We test the model’s predictions using a laboratory experiment with actual donations to charities and find that the tax rate has an insignificant effect on giving. The degree of waste, however, has a large, negative and highly significant effect on giving. © 2020, Economic Science Association.","Sheremeta, R.M.; Uler, N.",Exp. Econ.,1043
Management of opioid side effects in cancer-related and chronic noncancer pain: a systematic review,"Side effects can limit opioid dosage and reduce quality of life. The purpose of this systematic review was to assess the management of opioid side effects in the context of cancer pain management or, in the event that no evidence was available for cancer pain, for chronic noncancer pain. The side effects studied were constipation, pruritus, nausea and vomiting, myoclonus, sedation, respiratory depression, and delirium. Opioid rotation to manage side effects was also studied. For each side effect, we searched MEDLINE and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register and identified 657 possible titles for inclusion. Of these, 67 studies met inclusion criteria for analysis. The lack of well-designed, randomized controlled trials and the heterogeneity of populations and study designs made the drawing of firm conclusions difficult and precluded performance of meta-analysis. The type, strength, and consistency of evidence for available interventions to manage opioid side effects vary from strong (eg, on the use of naloxone to reverse respiratory depression or constipation) to weak (eg, changing from the oral to epidural route of morphine administration to manage sedation). Well-designed trials in the specified populations are required to furnish clinicians with secure evidence on managing opioid side effects successfully.","McNicol, Ewan; Horowicz-Mehler, Nathalie; Fisk, Ruth A; Bennett, Kyle; Gialeli-Goudas, Maria; Chew, Priscilla W; Lau, Joseph; Carr, Daniel; Americal Pain Society",J.

Lenders favor individual borrowers over groups or consortia of borrowers, a pattern consistent with the identifiable victim effect.

Spend or Save? Nonprofits’ Use of Donations and Other Revenues,"Panel regression methods are used to estimate the links between nonprofits’ revenues by source and the uses of those revenues. While charities spend most types of revenue on program services, they overwhelmingly save revenue from donations. This is true for all types of charity by National Taxonomy of Exempt Entities code. This saving is not driven by donor restrictions or by short-term strategic shifts but is consistent with expense smoothing over time.

Donor morbidity associated with right lobectomy for living donor liver transplantation to adult recipients: a systematic review,"The reported morbidity associated with live donor right lobe donation varied widely. This broad range was likely to be caused by varying definitions of complications. Standardised definitions of morbidity, and better methods for observing and measuring outcomes, are necessary to understand and potentially improve morbidity. XCM: The review question was clear, but two of the included studies contained no separate outcomes for right lobectomy. The authors carried out no validity assessment of the included studies. No details of the process of the review were reported, so it is not possible to judge whether the methodology was adequate. The search was confined to MEDLINE and reference lists, and to published English language papers, so relevant research is likely to have been missed. There is a possibility of publication bias towards successful outcomes, as unpublished studies were not sought. Details of the studies were reported well, and the synthesis was reasonable given the scarcity and poor quality of the available data.The conclusions followed from the results.

Social influence: Compliance and conformity,"This review covers recent developments in the social influence literature, focusing primarily on compliance and conformity research published between 1997 and 2002. The principles and processes underlying a target's susceptibility to outside influences are considered in light of three goals fundamental to rewarding human functioning. Specifically, targets are motivated to form accurate perceptions of reality and react accordingly, to develop and preserve meaningful social relationships, and to maintain a favorable self-concept. Consistent with the current movement in compliance and conformity research, this review emphasizes the ways in which these goals interact with external forces to engender social influence processes that are subtle, indirect, and outside of awareness.

Is there a dark side to government support for nonprofits?,"The relationship between government social spending and private donations to the nonprofit sector is an issue that is relevant to both public administrators and nonprofit managers. Does government funding displace philanthropy, or encourage it? This article introduces the debate into the public administration literature. First, I survey and interpret the empirical work performed to date in this area by economists. Second, I retest this question across four nonprofit subsectors using data on both federal and state/local spending. My survey of the literature shows mixed results, although a broad pattern indicates that ""crowding out"" tends to dominate, particularly in the areas of social service provision and health. My empirical results are consistent with these findings, although they must be interpreted cautiously from a policy perspective: While results are statistically significant, the degree of crowding out is generally small. On the other hand, the claim that government funding stimulates giving seems to lack both statistical and policy significance.","Brooks, A.C.",Public Adm. Rev.,1053
"Eyes are on us, but nobody cares: Are eye cues relevant for strong reciprocity?","Strong reciprocity is characterized by the willingness to altruistically reward cooperative acts and to altruistically punish norm-violating, defecting behaviours. Recent evidence suggests that subtle reputation cues, such as eyes staring at subjects during their choices, may enhance prosocial behaviour. Thus, in principle, strong reciprocity could also be affected by eye cues. We investigate the impact of eye cues on trustees' altruistic behaviour in a trust game and find zero effect. Neither the subjects who are classified as prosocial nor the subjects who are classified as selfish respond to these cues. In sharp contrast to the irrelevance of subtle reputation cues for strong reciprocity, we find a large effect of explicit, pecuniary reputation incentives on the trustees' prosociality. Trustees who can acquire a good reputation that benefits them in future interactions honour trust much more than trustees who cannot build a good reputation. These results cast doubt on hypotheses suggesting that strong reciprocity is easily malleable by implicit reputation cues not backed by explicit reputation incentives. © 2009 The Royal Society.","Fehr, E.; Schneider, F.",Proc.

Gaming tasks as a method for studying the impact of warning messages on information behavior,"New and nontraditional approaches are required to effectively tackle the global problem of cybercrime. Online warning messages offer the unique potential to influence information behavior at the exact point of user decision-making. This research assessed the prevention effect of differing components of warning messages. Thirty-five male par-ticipants, aged 18–43, participated in a behavioral-compliance task comprising messages received when visiting websites likely to contain malware. Participants also rated messages on believability, severity, and effects on intention to comply. The components of messages tested were as follows: three “signal words” (warning, hazard, and stop), two levels of message explicitness (high, low), and two imagery conditions (eyes, no eyes). Contrary to expectations, explicitness was the only message component to yield a significant preventative effect on self-rated and behavioral responses. Participants not only perceived the explicit messages as more believable, severe, and likely to increase intention to comply but also demonstrated, through their behavioral-compliance data, a preventative effect from more explicit messages. The implications of these findings for designing messages to prevent cybercrimes are explored. © 2020 The Board of Trustees, University of Illinois.","Haddad, A.; Sauer, J.; Prichard, J.; Spiranovic, C.; Gelb, K.",Libr.

A meta-analysis of the effectiveness of cell salvage to minimize perioperative allogeneic blood transfusion in cardiac and orthopedic surgery,"In orthopaedic surgery, both devices that wash and do not wash salvaged blood decrease the proportion of patients who receive a peri-operative allogeneic transfusion. The post-operative use of devices that do not wash salvaged blood in cardiac surgery was only marginally effective. The authors note that cell salvage did not appear to increase adverse events, although side-effects were inconsistently reported and the number of patients studied was relatively small. XCM: This review addressed a clearly stated research question. The interventions and the inclusion or exclusion criteria were stated, and the outcomes were well defined. The sources searched appear thorough, although the list of terms used for searching MEDLINE was fairly narrow. It is therefore possible that relevant trials were missed. However, the authors investigated possible publication bias using a funnel plot, and noted that no evidence of publication bias was found. The included trials were quality assessed, but this information was not used as an inclusion criterion. The authors investigated whether the Jadad (quality) score was related to the outcome.The details of the primary data provided in the review were insufficient. In particular, there was no information on the age and gender of the included patients. This could affect the interpretation of the results if the effects of cell salvage differ in different subgroups of the population. Furthermore, the authors presented the mean units of allogeneic blood transfused, whereas the primary outcome was the proportion of people getting one or more units of blood transfused. It is not clear from the paper how the authors reached a figure for the proportion of people getting at least one unit of blood as the figures in tables seem to be mean units received.The numbers of patients that the authors state are included in the meta-analysis (2,061) differs from the total number of patients enrolled in the individual trials (2,195). If this discrepancy occurred because enrolled patients were not randomised, or were lost to follow up, selection bias could have affected the results. The data in this review are pooled, despite the significant heterogeneity noted by the authors. The authors tried to investigate causes for this heterogeneity, but no conclusions were reached regarding this. In view of the heterogeneity noted between the studies, it may have been better to have used a random-effects model for the meta-analysis.The authors acknowledged the limitations of their review, such as the small sample size of the included studies, the heterogeneity that was found in some of the analyses, the exclusion of 19 published trials because the number of patients who received allogeneic red cell transfusions was not described, and the impossibility of blinding practitioners to the intervention. In the light of these limitations, the authors' conclusions are suitably conservative. XIM: Practice: The authors note problems associated with cell salvage and the high cost-utility ratio of this technique. They do not propose changes to practice in the light of their review.Research: The authors state that to determine which blood conservation technology is most appropriate, large comparisons of cell salvage such as pre-operative autologous donation, isovolemic haemodilution and the use of drugs (e.g. aprotinin, tranexamic acid, and erythropoietin), are needed.","Huet, C; Salmi, L R; Fergusson, D; W, Koopman-van Gemert A; Rubens, F; Laupacis, A",,1059
How important are work-family support policies? A meta-analytic investigation of their effects on employee outcomes,"This meta-analysis examines relationships between work-family support policies, which are policies that provide support for dependent care responsibilities, and employee outcomes by developing a conceptual model detailing the psychological mechanisms through which policy availability and use relate to work attitudes. Bivariate results indicated that availability and use of work-family support policies had modest positive relationships with job satisfaction, affective commitment, and intentions to stay. Further, tests of differences in effect sizes showed that policy availability was morestrongly related to job satisfaction, affective commitment, and intentions to stay than was policy use. Subsequent meta-analytic structural equation modeling results indicated that policy availability and use had modest effects on work attitudes, which were partially mediated by family-supportive organization perceptions and work-to-family conflict, respectively. Additionally, number of policies and sample characteristics (percent women, percent married-cohabiting, percent with dependents) moderated the effects of policy availability and use on outcomes. Implications of these findings and directions for future research on work-family support policies are discussed. © 2012 American Psychological Association.","Butts, M.M.; Casper, W.J.; Yang, T.S.",J.

The Effect of Lottery Scratch Tickets and Donation Offers on Response Fraction: A Study and Meta-Analysis,"Monetary incentives are the most effective way of increasing response to postal questionnaires; however, mailing currency is prohibited in many countries. Hence, nonmonetary incentives, such as lottery scratch tickets and donation offers, have been used. The effectiveness of different types of nonmonetary incentives is unclear, however. Two randomized controlled studies and meta-analyses were conducted to investigate the effect of two types of nonmonetary incentives on response. In the first study, the authors found that participants who received an unconditional lottery scratch ticket at invitation were 24% more likely to take part, while in the second study, the authors found that unconditional lottery scratch tickets and donation offers had a similar effect on response. The meta-analyses show that unconditional lottery scratch tickets significantly increase the chance of response by 9%, conditional scratch tickets have no effect, and donation offers cause a nonsignificant 4% increase in the chance of response. Unconditional lottery scratch tickets provide a modest increase in the likelihood of response.

"Dynamic income, progressive taxes, and the timing of charitable contributions","Using an econometric model of charitable giving and a 10-yr panel of US tax return data, the author finds that previous studies have underestimated the effects of permanent income and overestimated the effects of permanent changes in tax prices. The significant statutory tax changes that occurred during the 1980s, especially in 1986, serve to identify the key model parameters. The results imply that people smooth their giving when transitory income changes but also time their giving to exploit transitory changes in tax prices.

Priming intuition disfavors instrumental harm but not impartial beneficence,"Understanding the cognitive underpinnings of moral judgment is one of most pressing problems in psychological science. Some highly-cited studies suggest that reliance on intuition decreases utilitarian (expected welfare maximizing)judgments in sacrificial moral dilemmas in which one has to decide whether to instrumentally harm (IH)one person to save a greater number of people. However, recent work suggests that such dilemmas are limited in that they fail to capture the positive, defining core of utilitarianism: commitment to impartial beneficence (IB). Accordingly, a new two-dimensional model of utilitarian judgment has been proposed that distinguishes IH and IB components. The role of intuition on this new model has not been studied. Does relying on intuition disfavor utilitarian choices only along the dimension of instrumental harm or does it also do so along the dimension of impartial beneficence? To answer this question, we conducted three studies (total N = 970, two preregistered)using conceptual priming of intuition versus deliberation on moral judgments. Our evidence converges on an interaction effect, with intuition decreasing utilitarian judgments in IH—as suggested by previous work—but failing to do so in IB. These findings bolster the recently proposed two-dimensional model of utilitarian moral judgment, and point to new avenues for future research. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Capraro, V.; Everett, J.A.C.; Earp, B.D.",J.

THE COMBINED EFFECT OF DONATION PRICE AND ADMINISTRATIVE INEFFICIENCY ON DONATIONS TO US NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS,"We examine the effects that two accounting measures of nonprofit organization (NPO) inefficiency, administrative inefficiency and donation price, have on donations to US NPOs using a better-specified model and industry-specific samples. Although numerous studies examine the effect that donation price has on donations (e.g., Marudas and Jacobs, 2006; Marudas, 2004; Khanna and Sandler, 2000; and Tinkelman, 1999), only three studies examine the effect of administrative inefficiency on donations (Tinkelman and Mankaney, 2007; Frumkin and Kim, 2001; and Greenlee and Brown, 1999). However, none of these studies tests donation price and administrative inefficiency in one model and only two test industry-specific samples of NPOs. We find that misspecifying the model by including only one of these two inefficiency measures creates substantial bias and the effect of administrative inefficiency on donations varies substantially across industries. Administrative inefficiency has a significantly negative effect on donations to NPOs in the full sample and the philanthropy sample, but no significant effect on donations to NPOs in the arts, education, health, or human services samples. Furthermore, donation price has a significantly negative effect on donations to NPOs in the full sample and the education, health and human services samples, but not in the arts or philanthropy samples. Results are also reported for the other variables in the model – government support, program service revenue, fundraising and organizational age, wealth and size. © 2009 The Authors Journal compilation © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd","Jacobs, F.A.; Marudas, N.P.",Financ.

WHO is 'behavioral'? Cognitive ability and anomalous preferences,"In this paper, we ask whether variation in preference anomalies is related to variation in cognitive ability. Evidence from a new laboratory study of Chilean high-school students with similar schooling backgrounds shows that small-stakes risk aversion and short-run discounting are less common among those with higher standardized test scores. The relationship with test scores survives controls for parental education and wealth. We find some evidence that elementary-school GPA is predictive of preferences measured at the end of high school. Two laboratory interventions provide suggestive evidence of a possible causal impact of cognitive resources on expressed preferences. © 2013 by the European Economic Association.","Benjamin, D.J.; Brown, S.A.; Shapiro, J.M.",J.

"An experimental investigation of ultimatum games: information, fairness, expectations, and lowest acceptable offers","We designed two laboratory experiments to test popular hypotheses explaining the failure of subgame-perfect equilibrium models to explain behavior in ultimatum games. The first experiment varied information available to respondents. When respondents did not know the amount being divided, offerers offered (and respondents accepted) significantly lower offers than when the respondents knew the amount being divided. The second experiment replicated this result and also showed that people occasionally reject ""free"" money (i.e., offers with no strings attached). This evidence does not support earlier explanations for ultimatum anomalies and identifies conditions where subgame-perfect models apply. © 1995.","Straub, P.G.; Murnighan, J.K.",J. Econ. Behav.

Cognitive processes underlying distributional preferences: a response time study,"There is ample evidence that people differ considerably in their preferences. We identify individual heterogeneity in type and strength of social preferences in a series of binary three-person dictator games. Based on this identification, we analyze response times in another series of games to investigate the cognitive processes of distributional preferences. We find that response time increases with the number of conflicts between individually relevant motives and decreases with the utility difference between choice options. The selfish motive is more intuitive for subjects who are more selfish. Our findings indicate that the sequential sampling process and the intuition of selfishness jointly produce distribution decisions, and provide an explanation for the mixed results on the correlations between response time and prosociality. Our results also show that it is important to take heterogeneity of preferences into account when investigating the cognitive processes of social decision making. © 2019, Economic Science Association.","Chen, F.; Fischbacher, U.",Exp.

The secular landscape: The decline of religion in America,"This book proposes a comprehensive theory of the loss of religion in human societies, with a specific and substantive focus on the contemporary United States. Kevin McCaffree draws on a range of disciplines including sociology, psychology, anthropology, and history to explore topics such as the origin of religion, the role of religion in recent American history, the loss of religion, and how Americans are dealing with this loss. The book is not only richly theoretical but also empirical. Hundreds of scientific studies are cited, and new statistical analyses enhance its core arguments. What emerges is an integrative and illuminating theory of secularization. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s) 2017. All rights reserved.","McCaffree, K.",The Secul.

Genome wide association study (GWAS) of Chagas cardiomyopathy in Trypanosoma cruzi seropositive subjects,"BACKGROUND: Familial aggregation of Chagas cardiac disease in T. cruzi-infected persons suggests that human genetic variation may be an important determinant of disease progression. OBJECTIVE: To perform a GWAS using a well-characterized cohort to detect single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and genes associated with cardiac outcomes. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was developed by the NHLBI REDS-II program in Brazil. Samples were collected from 499 T. cruzi seropositive blood donors who had donated between 1996 and 2002, and 101 patients with clinically diagnosed Chagas cardiomyopathy. In 2008-2010, all subjects underwent a complete medical examination. After genotype calling, quality control filtering with exclusion of 20 cases, and imputation of 1,000 genomes variants; association analysis was performed for 7 cardiac and parasite related traits, adjusting for population stratification. RESULTS: The cohort showed a wide range of African, European, and modest Native American admixture proportions, consistent with the recent history of Brazil. No SNPs were found to be highly (P<10(-8)) associated with cardiomyopathy. The two mostly highly associated SNPs for cardiomyopathy (rs4149018 and rs12582717; P-values <10(-6)) are located on Chromosome 12p12.2 in the SLCO1B1 gene, a solute carrier family member. We identified 44 additional genic SNPs associated with six traits at P-value <10(-6): Ejection Fraction, PR, QRS, QT intervals, antibody levels by EIA, and parasitemia by PCR. CONCLUSION: This GWAS identified suggestive SNPs that may impact the risk of progression to cardiomyopathy. Although this Chagas cohort is the largest examined by GWAS to date, (580 subjects), moderate sample size may explain in part the limited number of significant SNP variants. Enlarging the current sample through expanded cohorts and meta-analyses, and targeted studies of candidate genes, will be required to confirm and extend the results reported here. Future studies should also include exposed seronegative controls to investigate genetic associations with susceptibility or resistance to T. cruzi infection and non-Chagas cardiomyopathy.","Deng, Xutao; Sabino, Ester C; Cunha-Neto, Edecio; Ribeiro, Antonio L; Ianni, Barbara; Mady, Charles; Busch, Michael P; Seielstad, Mark; REDSII Chagas Study Group from the NHLBI Retrovirus Epidemiology Donor Study-II Component International",PLoS One,1080
Anticipated guilt as behavioral motivation: An examination of appeals to help unknown others through bone marrow donation,"The current study posits that messages used to elicit behaviors to help unknown others must present substantial perceptions of a threat and efficacy to be successful. Given that many prosocial helping messages depict a threat to unknown others, the current investigation proposed that anticipated guilt is a motivating force behind individuals' willingness to engage in behaviors to avert the unknown-other-directed threat. Specifically, this study hypothesized that messages which induce substantial perceptions of (a) threat, (b) response-efficacy, and (c) self-efficacy would result in feelings of anticipated guilt that subsequently motivate behavioral intent and, ultimately, behaviors to avert the threat to unknown others and avoid the future guilt that they might feel personally. Brehm's (1966) psychological reactance theory, however, notes that such appeals might result in reactance and thus decrease compliance with a message's prescribed actions. Two research questions were posed to determine (a) whether or not individuals experience reactance and (b) what effect, if any, reactance has on compliance. Additionally, participants' accuracy in forecasting guilt was assessed. The proposed model and research questions were tested by focusing on the topic of bone marrow donation. Participants were assigned randomly to one of three message conditions (control and two experimental messages), completed a questionnaire and returned to complete a follow-up survey 7-10 days later. The data were consistent with the proposed model, and additional findings indicated that participants did not experience psychological reactance and were not accurate when forecasting future feelings of guilt. © 2005 International Communication Association.","Lindsey, L.L.M.",Hum.

"Personality traits, emotional intelligence and decision-making styles in Lebanese universities medical students","Background: This study aims to assess the impact of personality traits on emotional intelligence (EI) and decision-making among medical students in Lebanese Universities and to evaluate the potential mediating role-played by emotional intelligence between personality traits and decision-making styles in this population. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted between June and December 2019 on 296 general medicine students. Results: Higher extroversion was associated with lower rational decision-making style, whereas higher agreeableness and conscientiousness were significantly associated with a higher rational decision-making style. More extroversion and openness to experience were significantly associated with a higher intuitive style, whereas higher agreeableness and conscientiousness were significantly associated with lower intuitive style. More agreeableness and conscientiousness were significantly associated with a higher dependent decision-making style, whereas more openness to experience was significantly associated with less dependent decision-making style. More agreeableness, conscientiousness, and neuroticism were significantly associated with less spontaneous decision-making style. None of the personality traits was significantly associated with the avoidant decision-making style. Emotional intelligence seemed to fully mediate the association between conscientiousness and intuitive decision-making style by 38% and partially mediate the association between extroversion and openness to experience with intuitive decision-making style by 49.82 and 57.93% respectively. Conclusion: Our study suggests an association between personality traits and decision-making styles. The results suggest that EI showed a significant positive effect on intuitive decision-making style and a negative effect on avoidant and dependent decision-making styles. Additionally, our study underlined the role of emotional intelligence as a mediator factor between personality traits (namely conscientiousness, openness, and extroversion) and decision-making styles. © 2020 The Author(s).","El Othman, R.; Hallit, R.; Obeid, S.; Hallit, S.",BMC Psychol.,1082

XIM: The authors did not state any implications for practice.Research: The authors stated that further trials were required to identify the optimum dosage of MSM and DMSO and consider their long-term safety and efficacy as adjunctive or alternative treatments for osteoarthritis. There was a need to improve the design, analysis and reporting of future studies; these included adequate power to detect a treatment effect, use of an adequate treatment period, appropriate outcome measures and appropriate blinding. A trial that compared MSM and standard conventional treatment would be of value.","Brien, S; Prescott, P; Bashir, N; Lewith, H; Lewith, G",,1085
Who gives? Partisan donations in Europe,"Party finance reformers often call for European parties to increase their financial reliance on small donors, but researchers have made few efforts to establish the feasibility of such strategies. This study examines partisan giving in Europe, investigating the potential for parties and policymakers to increase this type of political participation. It also asks whether there are national-level factors that make such efforts more likely to succeed in some countries. The research uses data from the European Social Survey to examine patterns of contributions to political parties in 16 European countries. It finds that the strength of partisanship predicts political giving independent of party membership, which suggests that European political parties may have some scope to increase their number of individual donors. On the other hand, existing tax policies to encourage political giving do not seem to be effective in increasing this type of partisan political participation. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","Ponce, A.F.; Scarrow, S.E.",West Eur.

Cost-effectiveness of proton pump inhibitor therapy for acute peptic ulcer-related bleeding,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this investigation was to perform a cost-effectiveness analysis of adjunctive oral and intravenous proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapies for patients with acute peptic ulcer-related bleeding of sufficient severity to warrant hospitalization. DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness investigation. Four clinical scenarios were considered: scenario 1, diagnostic endoscopy with oral PPI therapy; scenario 2, diagnostic and therapeutic endoscopy with high-dose intravenous PPI therapy; scenario 3, diagnostic and therapeutic endoscopy available with oral PPI therapy; and scenario 4, diagnostic and therapeutic endoscopy (no PPI). Effectiveness was evaluated in terms of episodes of bleeding averted and quality-adjusted life years. SETTING: University teaching hospital in the United States. PATIENTS: Hospitalized patients with acute peptic ulcer bleeding. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Therapeutic endoscopy with high-dose intravenous PPI therapy (scenario 2) was the most cost-effective approach in terms of bleeding episode averted (8,490 vs. 10,201 US dollars for scenario 1, 8,756 US dollars for scenario 3, and 12,459 US dollars for scenario 4) and per quality-adjusted life year (4,810 vs. 5,533 US dollars for scenario 1, 4,946 US dollars for scenario 3, and 5,876 US dollars for scenario 4). The high-dose intravenous PPI scenario was the dominant approach as evidenced by both superior effectiveness and lower costs over the range of probability and cost variables used in the sensitivity analysis. However, the dominance would be lost if the purchase cost of the intravenous PPI was substantially higher than the baseline cost assumed in this investigation (61 US dollars per 3-day course of therapy). CONCLUSION: High-dose intravenous PPI therapy in conjunction with therapeutic endoscopy is the most cost-effective approach for the management of hospitalized patients with acute peptic ulcer bleeding.","Erstad, Brian L",Crit.

In particular, a between-subjects experiment (N = 143) examined differences in affective, cognitive, and motivational responses to lifestyle transforming versus game based reality programs. Findings indicate that lifestyle transforming reality TV produced stronger feelings of elevation and perceptions of the program as moving and thought-provoking than game reality TV, which in turn increased motivations for altruism.

Collaborative governance in theory and practice,"Over the past few decades, a new form of governance has emerged to replace adversarial and managerial modes of policy making and implementation. Collaborative governance, as it has come to be known, brings public and private stakeholders together in collective forums with public agencies to engage in consensus-oriented decision making. In this article, we conduct a meta-analytical study of the existing literature on collaborative governance with the goal of elaborating a contingency model of collaborative governance. After reviewing 137 cases of collaborative governance across a range of policy sectors, we identify critical variables that will influence whether or not this mode of governance will produce successful collaboration. These variables include the prior history of conflict or cooperation, the incentives for stakeholders to participate, power and resources imbalances, leadership, and institutional design. We also identify a series of factors that are crucial within the collaborative process itself. These factors include face-to-face dialogue, trust building, and the development of commitment and shared understanding. We found that a virtuous cycle of collaboration tends to develop when collaborative forums focus on ""small wins"" that deepen trust, commitment, and shared understanding. The article concludes with a discussion of the implications of our contingency model for practitioners and for future research on collaborative governance.","Ansell, C.; Gash, A.",J. Public Adm. Res.

A social identity threat perspective on being the target of generosity from a higher status other,"Both giving and receiving money have emotional benefits, but when gifts of value are made in the context of socioeconomic differences, there might also be emotional costs. Four studies (and an internal meta-analysis) tested the idea that receiving a generous gift from someone higher in perceived socioeconomic status (SES) signals social identity threat. In Study 1 (N = 218), participants on average, but especially those with relatively lower SES, reported experiencing more self-conscious negative affect when receiving a generous amount of money (vs. an even split) from a higher status giver in a dictator game. This effect was mediated by feeling pitied by the giver. Studies 2 (N = 331) and 3 (N = 426) revealed similar effects with recalled real-world experiences of receiving a generous gift from higher SES givers. Studies 3 and 4 (N = 142) revealed evidence for serial mediation, with lower relative SES predicting status awareness, status awareness predicting attributions of pity, and attributions of pity in turn predicting self-conscious negative affect. Effects were not significantly moderated by needing or requesting the money, suggesting that acts of generosity across the status divide readily signal social devaluation for those with lower perceived status. Findings have practical and conceptual implications for prosocial giving in a system of social and economic inequality.

Industry-supported meta-analyses compared with meta-analyses with non-profit or no support: differences in methodological quality and conclusions,"BACKGROUND: Studies have shown that industry-sponsored meta-analyses of drugs lack scientific rigour and have biased conclusions. However, these studies have been restricted to certain medical specialities. We compared all industry-supported meta-analyses of drug-drug comparisons with those without industry support. METHODS: We searched PubMed for all meta-analyses that compared different drugs or classes of drugs published in 2004. Two authors assessed the meta-analyses and independently extracted data. We used a validated scale for judging the methodological quality and a binary scale for judging conclusions. We divided the meta-analyses according to the type of support in 3 categories: industry-supported, non-profit support or no support, and undeclared support. RESULTS: We included 39 meta-analyses. Ten had industry support, 18 non-profit or no support, and 11 undeclared support. On a 0-7 scale, the median quality score was 6 for meta-analyses with non-profit or no support and 2.5 for the industry-supported meta-analyses (P < 0.01). Compared with industry-supported meta-analyses, more meta-analyses with non-profit or no support avoided bias in the selection of studies (P = 0.01), more often stated the search methods used to find studies (P = 0.02), searched comprehensively (P < 0.01), reported criteria for assessing the validity of the studies (P = 0.02), used appropriate criteria (P = 0.04), described methods of allocation concealment (P = 0.05), described methods of blinding (P = 0.05), and described excluded patients (P = 0.08) and studies (P = 0.15). Forty percent of the industry-supported meta-analyses recommended the experimental drug without reservations, compared with 22% of the meta-analyses with non-profit or no support (P = 0.57).In a sensitivity analysis, we contacted the authors of the meta-analyses with undeclared support. Eight who replied that they had not received industry funding were added to those with non-profit or no support, and 3 who did not reply were added to those with industry support. This analysis did not change the results much. CONCLUSION: Transparency is essential for readers to make their own judgment about medical interventions guided by the results of meta-analyses. We found that industry-supported meta-analyses are less transparent than meta-analyses with non-profit support or no support.","Jørgensen, Anders W; Maric, Katja L; Tendal, Britta; Faurschou, Annesofie; Gøtzsche, Peter C",BMC Med.

How do dogs monitor the human’s attentional state after challenged by the presence of forbidden food?,"Introduction: Converging evidence suggests that the presence of (attentive) others has a positive effect on people’s propensity to conform to social rules. It is also increasingly accepted that pet dogs are promising test subjects to study non-human analogues of ‘audience effect.’ This study investigates whether dogs show a tendency to change their behavior according to the visual attention of familiar and unfamiliar human partners in a situation in which human partners disallowed the dog from eating a piece of food. Methods: Dogs (n = 64) participated in two observational conditions (Attentive Owner and Attentive Experimenter) and a control condition in which both human participants engaged in distracting activity. Results: The results showed that the identity of the attentive or inattentive partner has little relevance to the dogs’ gazing behavior (i.e., head orientation toward the different partners and the food) and their decisions about breaking or following the rule. This is in line with previous studies suggesting that the presence of the owner predominantly determines the dogs’ responses to such situations. Discussion: Further analysis of dogs responding differently to the obedience challenge showed marked differences in the role of the ‘audience effect’ might play in modulating ‘fully obedient,’ ‘ignorer,’ and ‘hesitating’ dogs’ gazing behavior. These findings point to the context-dependent nature of the audience effect in dogs and highlight the importance of frequently ignored individual differences in dogs’ tendency to conform to the situational rules. © 2019, The Author(s).","Kiss, O.; Topál, J.",Biol.

Evolutionary Origins of Morality: Insights From Non-human Primates,"The aim of this contribution is to explore the origins of moral behavior and its underlying moral preferences and intuitions from an evolutionary perspective. Such a perspective encompasses both the ultimate, adaptive function of morality in our own species, as well as the phylogenetic distribution of morality and its key elements across primates. First, with regard to the ultimate function, we argue that human moral preferences are best construed as adaptations to the affordances of the fundamentally interdependent hunter-gatherer lifestyle of our hominin ancestors. Second, with regard to the phylogenetic origin, we show that even though full-blown human morality is unique to humans, several of its key elements are not. Furthermore, a review of evidence from non-human primates regarding prosocial concern, conformity, and the potential presence of universal, biologically anchored and arbitrary cultural norms shows that these elements of morality are not distributed evenly across primate species. This suggests that they have evolved along separate evolutionary trajectories. In particular, the element of prosocial concern most likely evolved in the context of shared infant care, which can be found in humans and some New World monkeys. Strikingly, many if not all of the elements of morality found in non-human primates are only evident in individualistic or dyadic contexts, but not as third-party reactions by truly uninvolved bystanders. We discuss several potential explanations for the unique presence of a systematic third-party perspective in humans, but focus particularly on mentalizing ability and language. Whereas both play an important role in present day, full-blown human morality, it appears unlikely that they played a causal role for the original emergence of morality. Rather, we suggest that the most plausible scenario to date is that human morality emerged because our hominin ancestors, equipped on the one hand with large and powerful brains inherited from their ape-like ancestor, and on the other hand with strong prosocial concern as a result of cooperative breeding, could evolve into an ever more interdependent social niche. © Copyright © 2018 Burkart, Brügger and van Schaik.","Burkart, J.M.; Brügger, R.K.; van Schaik, C.P.",Front. sociol.,1099
THE AID EFFECTIVENESS LITERATURE: THE SAD RESULTS OF 40 YEARS OF RESEARCH,"The aid effectiveness literature (AEL) consists of empirical macroeconomic estimates of the effects of development aid. By the end of 2004, it comprised 97 econometric studies of three families of related effects. Each family has been analyzed in a separate meta-analysis. The AEL is an ideal subject for meta-analysis as it uses only a few formally similar models to estimate the same underlying effects. It is also an area with strong beliefs, often generated by altruism. When this whole literature is examined, a clear pattern emerges. After 40 years of development aid, the preponderance of the evidence indicates that aid has not been effective. We show that the distribution of results is significantly asymmetric reflecting the reluctance of the research community to publish negative results. The Dutch disease effect on exchange rates provides a plausible explanation for the observed aid ineffectiveness. © Journal compilation © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Doucouliagos, Hristos; Paldam, Martin",J.

Investigating the origin and consequences of endogenous default options in repeated economic choices,"Classical value-based decision theories state that economic choices are solely based on the value of available options. Experimental evidence suggests, however, that individuals' choices are biased towards default options, prompted by the framing of decisions. Although the effects of default options created by exogenous framing-such as how choice options are displayed-are well-documented, little is known about the potential effects and properties of endogenous framing, that is, originating from an individual's internal state. In this study, we investigated the existence and properties of endogenous default options in a task involving choices between risky lotteries. By manipulating and examining the effects of three experimental features-time pressure, time spent on task and relative choice proportion towards a specific option-, we reveal and dissociate two features of endogenous default options which bias individuals' choices: a natural tendency to prefer certain types of options (natural default), and the tendency to implicitly learn a default option from past choices (learned default). Additional analyses suggest that while the natural default may bias the standard choice process towards an option category, the learned default effects may be attributable to a second independent choice process. Overall, these investigations provide a first experimental evidence of how individuals build and apply diverse endogenous default options in economic decision-making and how this biases their choices. © 2020 Couto et al.","Couto, J.; Van Maanen, L.; Lebreton, M.",PLoS ONE,1101
The impact of social approval and framing on cooperation in public good situations,"Several economists have maintained that social and internalized norms can enforce cooperation in public good situations.

The experiment has two treatment effects. Firstly, it reveals each person's identity and his contribution to the public good. Secondly, it presents the public good game in a language that suggests associations to social and internalized norms for cooperation.

Erythropoietin and preoperative autologous blood donation in the prevention of hepatitis C infection: necessity or luxury?,"BACKGROUND: Prevention of exposure to allogeneic blood transfusion during surgery is an important financial issue when recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) is used in addition to preoperative blood donation. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The aim of this study was to carry out a cost-effectiveness analysis of the use of rHuEPO in preoperative blood donation in orthopedic surgery. The study, based on a decision tree analysis of the use of rHuEPO, was conducted from the perspective of the French health care system. The efficacy criterion was the number of hepatitis C infections prevented. The decision tree analysis was constructed as follows: the residual risk of hepatitis C infection was 8.26 per million units transfused, and the chance node was defined according to the number of units transfused. RESULTS: With the use of rHuEPO in preoperative blood donation, 0.30562 cases of hepatitis C infection per 100,000 patients were prevented. The incremental cost of one prevented hepatitis C infection amounted to $888,000,000 (US). CONCLUSION: Despite the limitations of our model, the cost-effectiveness ratio was so large that variations only slightly modified the size of the result. From the societal perspective, it was not cost-effective to add rHuEPO to preoperative blood donation.","Woronoff-Lemsi, M C; Arveux, P; Limat, S; Morel, P; Le Pen, C; Cahn, J Y",Transfusion,1105
Responses of chimpanzees to cues of conspecific observation,"Recent evidence has shown that humans are remarkably sensitive to artificial cues of conspecific observation when making decisions with potential social consequences. Whether similar effects are found in other great apes has not yet been investigated. We carried out two experiments in which individual chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, took items of food from an array in the presence of either an image of a large conspecific face or a scrambled control image. In experiment 1 we compared three versions of the face image varying in size and the amount of the face displayed. In experiment 2 we compared a fourth variant of the image with more prominent coloured eyes displayed closer to the focal chimpanzee. The chimpanzees did not look at the face images significantly more than at the control images in either experiment. Although there were trends for some individuals in each experiment to be slower to take high-value food items in the face conditions, these were not consistent or robust. We suggest that the extreme human sensitivity to cues of potential conspecific observation may not be shared with chimpanzees. © 2013 The Authors.","Nettle, D.; Cronin, K.A.; Bateson, M.",Anim.

"Showing Off, Handicap Signaling, and the Evolution of Men's Work","Zahavi's1,2 handicap principle makes ""waste"" a common outcome of signal selection because the cost of a signal guarantees its honesty. The capacity to bear the cost reveals the show-off's hidden qualities, While displays take many forms, some also provide fitness-related benefits to the audience in addition to Information about the show-off. Zahavi 3 has used the handicap principle to explain both merely wasteful displays and altruistic behavior. Here we focus on the distinction between these two kinds of display and the importance of benefits other than Information in show-off explanations of a particular puzzle in human evolution: men's work. Males of other primate species do not contribute any significant fraction of the food consumed by females and juveniles. Our own species is different. When people live on wild foods, hunting is usually a specialty of men, and meat is commonly a substantial component of everyone's diet. Here we explore the hypothesis that this unique male subsistence contribution may have evolved as hunting large animals became a focus of competitive display.","Hawkes, K.; Bird, R.B.",Evol.

"Dual cognitive pathways to voice quality: Frequent voicers improvise, infrequent voicers elaborate","We investigate the involvement of Working Memory Capacity (WMC, the cognitive resource necessary for controlled elaborate thinking) in voice behavior (speaking up with suggestions, problems, and opinions to change the organization). While scholars assume voice requires elaborate thinking, some empirical evidence suggests voice might be more automatic. To explain this discrepancy, we distinguish between voice quantity (frequency of voice) and voice quality (novelty and value of voiced information) and propose that WMC is important for voice quality, but less for voice quantity. Furthermore, we propose that frequent voicers rely less on WMC to reach high voice quality than people who voice rarely. To test our ideas, we conducted three studies: a between-participant lab-study, a within-participant experiment, and a multi-source field-study. All studies supported our expectation that voice quantity is unrelated to WMC, and that voice quality is positively related to WMC, but only for those who rarely voice. This indicates that the decision to voice (quantity) might be more automatic and intuitive than often assumed, whereas its value to the organization (quality), relies more on the degree of cognitive elaboration of the voicer. It also suggests that frequent and infrequent voicers use distinct cognitive pathways to voice high-quality information: frequent voicers improvise, while infrequent voicers elaborate. © 2019 Wolsink et al.

Unofficial Development Assistance: A Model of Development Charities' Donation Income,"The empirical literature on the determinants of charities' donation income, distinguishing the charitable cause, is small. We consider the case of development charities specifically. Using a panel covering a quarter of a century, we observe a strong fundraising effect and a unitary household income elasticity. We find evidence that the conventionally identified 'price' effect may simply be the product of omitted variable bias. Our results further suggest that public spending on development crowds in private donations for development. We find a positive spillover effect of fundraising, suggesting the efforts of one development charity may increase contributions to other development charities. © 2014 The Authors.

It was hypothesized that unless the communication occasioned an effortful response or was structurally (rather than semantically) novel, responding that suggests ignorance of relevant information would occur. The predictions were confirmed for both oral (Exp I) and written communications (Exps II and III).

Battle for the thermostat: Gender and the effect of temperature on cognitive performance,"This paper studies differences in the effect of temperature on cognitive performance by gender in a large controlled lab experiment (N = 543). We study performance in math, verbal and cognitive reflection tasks and find that the effects of temperature vary significantly across men and women. At higher temperatures, women perform better on a math and verbal task while the reverse effect is observed for men. The increase in female performance in response to higher temperature is significantly larger and more precisely estimated than the corresponding decrease in male performance. In contrast to math and verbal tasks, temperature has no impact on a measure of cognitive reflection for either gender. Our findings suggest that gender mixed workplaces may be able to increase productivity by setting the thermostat higher than current standards. © 2019 Chang, Kajackaite.

Effects of individual and organizational factors on safety consciousness and safety citizenship behavior of construction workers: A comparative study between Hong Kong and Mainland China,"In view of the great number of accidents in the construction industry of both Hong Kong and Mainland China, research on the safety issues of construction personnel plays a significant role in industrial development and occupational health. Recently, although the safety consciousness (SC) and safety citizenship behavior (SCB) have been considered promising for safety enhancement, the relevant influence factors still remain unclarified. Therefore, the present study aimed to explore the main factors that influence the SC and SCB of construction workers by conducting a cross-sectional questionnaire survey with 207 responses from Hong Kong and 208 responses from Mainland China. The specifically designed questionnaires consisted of eight subscales measuring direct and indirect effects among six factors (safety climate, proactivity, prosociality, leader-to-member exchange, peer-to-peer exchange and work stress) and two constructs (SC and SCB). The collected data were analyzed through SPSS 24 and AMOS 24 to verify the influence mechanism in individual and organizational aspects of SC and SCB and further provide implications and suggestions for academic circles and industrial practitioners in line with the territorial comparison between Hong Kong and Mainland China. This study is unique as it offers a considerably good explanation for the territorial distinction of influence factors on SC and SCB for construction personnel in Mainland China and Hong Kong. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Meng, X.; Chan, A.H.S.; Lui, L.K.H.; Fang, Y.",Saf.

How We Perceive Others Resembling Us,"Eye contact is essential for social cognition, acting as an important tool for social communication. While differences in face scanning patterns concerning familiarity have been thoroughly investigated, the impact of facial similarity on gaze behavior has not been examined yet. We addressed this topic by recording subjects’ eye-directed gazing while looking at faces that were individually created systematically varying in terms of similarity to the self-face and familiarity. Subjects’ self-faces were morphed into three other faces including a close friend of the same sex. Afterwards, they rated similarity to their self-face of those morphed face stimuli in a separate rating task. Our results show a general preference for the eyes’ area as well as differences regarding fixation patterns depending on similarity to the self-face. The lower the similarity to the self-face, the more fixations on the eyes’ area. Subjects’ ratings followed a linear line, indicating well-pronounced face perception. Nevertheless, other faces were rated faster than the self-face independent of familiarity, while morphed faces got the slowest ratings. Our results mirror the importance of similarity to the self-face as a factor shaping the way we look at the eyes of others explaining variance apart from familiarity. © The Author(s) 2020.","Hoffmann, A.; Maran, T.; Sachse, P.",i-Perception,1118
Complementary or Supplementary? The Relationship Between Government Size and Nonprofit Sector Size,"Do government activities discourage or leverage nonprofit activities? The extant literature has proposed competing lines of arguments, making the net effect ambiguous. The present study conducts a meta-analysis to synthesize extant studies concerning the relationship between the level of government activities and the level of nonprofit activities within a locality and explore potential moderating effects. Through systematically reviewing 30 extant studies, the study finds a mostly positive association between the level of government activities and the level of nonprofit activities, but this relationship is generally weak and sometimes statistically insignificant. In addition, the moderator analysis concludes that data structure, unit of analysis, and field of activity significantly moderate effect size estimates across extant studies. Overall, the net relationship between the level of government activities and the level of nonprofit activities within a locality ranges from null to slight positive. Government activities generally seem not to discourage nonprofit activities, but may slightly leverage them. © 2018, International Society for Third-Sector Research and The Johns Hopkins University.","Lu, J.; Xu, C.",Voluntas,1119

Advanced maternal age: ethical and medical considerations for assisted reproductive technology,"OBJECTIVES: This review explores the ethical and medical challenges faced by women of advanced maternal age who decide to have children. Assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs) make post-menopausal pregnancy physiologically plausible, however, one must consider the associated physical, psychological, and sociological factors involved. METHODS: A quasi-systematic review was conducted in PubMed and Ovid using the key terms post-menopause, pregnancy + MeSH terms [donations, hormone replacement therapy, assisted reproductive technologies, embryo donation, donor artificial insemination, cryopreservation]. Overall, 28 papers encompassing two major themes (ethical and medical) were included in the review. CONCLUSION: There are significant ethical considerations and medical (maternal and fetal) complications related to pregnancy in peri- and post-menopausal women. When examining the ethical and sociological perspective, the literature portrays an overall positive attitude toward pregnancy in advanced maternal age. With respect to the medical complications, the general consensus in the evaluated studies suggests that there is greater risk of complication for spontaneous pregnancy when the mother is older (eg, >35 years old). This risk can be mitigated by careful medical screening of the mother and the use of ARTs in healthy women. In these instances, a woman of advanced maternal age who is otherwise healthy can carry a pregnancy with a similar risk profile to that of her younger counterparts when using donated oocytes.","Harrison, Brittany J; Hilton, Tara N; Rivière, Raphaël N; Ferraro, Zachary M; Deonandan, Raywat; Walker, Mark C",Int.

Do government grants to private charities crowd out giving or fund-raising?,"Economists have long observed that crowding out of government grants to private charities is incomplete. The accepted belief is that givers treat the grants as imperfect substitutes for private giving. We theoretically and empirically investigate a second reason: the strategic response of a charity will be to reduce fund-raising efforts after receiving a grant. Employing panel data from arts and social service organizations, we find that government grants cause significant reductions in fund-raising. This adds a new dimension to the policy discussions - analysts should account for the behavioral responses of the charity, as well as the donors, to government grants.","Andreoni, J.; Payne, A.A.",Am.

Open-Identity Sperm Donation: How Does Offering Donor-Identifying Information Relate to Donor-Conceived Offspring's Wishes and Needs?,"Over the past years, a growing number of countries have legislated open-identity donation, in which donor-conceived offspring are given access to the donor's identity once the child has reached maturity. It is held that donor anonymity creates identity problems for such children similar to the ""genealogical bewilderment"" described within the adoption context. The study of the social and psychological effects of open-identity donation is still very much in its infancy, but what has been left unquestioned is whether (and to what extent) offering access to the donor's name and address is an adequate response to such effects. This study has two goals: First, we aim to provide a systematic review of the reasons why donor-conceived (DC) offspring want to know the identity of their sperm donor. Second, we examine to what extent the provision of donor-identifying information can satisfy the reasons mentioned. The most important motivations appear to be: (1) to avoid medical risks and consanguineous relationships; (2) to satisfy curiosity; (3) to learn more about the self or to complete one's identity; (4) to learn more about what kind of person the donor is (biographical information, why he donated, etc.); (5) to form a relationship with the donor and/or his family; and (6) to learn about one's ancestry/genealogy. Our analysis shows that for nearly all of these reasons access to the donor's identity is not necessary. In those cases where it is, moreover, donor identification is not sufficient. What is really needed is (extended) contact with the donor, rather than the mere provision of his name.","Ravelingien, An; Provoost, Veerle; Pennings, Guido",J. Bioeth. Inq.,1124
Empirical Relations Between Government Spending and Charitable Donations,"One might expect that increased governmental social-service expenditures would reduce charitable donations, but the direction and magnitude of this effect is theoretically indeterminate. Empirical estimates of this “crowdout” phenomenon are produced from British time-series data. Results suggest that a dollar of governmental social-service expenditures “crowds out” only about one-half cent of charitable donations. This implies that governmental cutbacks will not be largely replaced by charitable donations, a result consistent with most previously published studies. © 1985, Sage Publications.

The impact of epidemic infectious diseases on the wellbeing of migrant workers: A systematic review,"Background: The COVID-19 outbreak poses challenges to people across the world and puts marginalized populations in an even more precarious position. Migrant workers, with their marginal socio-legal status in host countries, are especially vulnerable during the pandemic. The wellbeing of migrant workers, specifically low-wage laborers, is greatly compromised. Objectives: This study aims to systematically review the existing literature on how epidemic infectious diseases affect the wellbeing of migrant workers and what are the interventions to improve their wellbeing. Method: Following the PRISMA guideline, studies on migrant workers’ wellbeing or interventions to improve wellbeing during five major epidemic infectious diseases (i.e., COVID-19, SARS, Ebola, H1N1, MERS) were searched. Eleven electronic databases were used: Cochrane Library, WHO Global Research COVID-19 database, APA PsycInfo, CINAHL Plus, ERIC, MEDLINE, Social Index, PubMed, ProQuest, Social Care Online and EPPI-Mapper. In total, 17 articles that met the criteria were included. An assessment guide was developed to examine the quality of the studies. Results: Overall, the studies consistently show that major epidemic outbreaks negatively affect the physical, financial, psychological and social wellbeing of migrant workers. Migrant workers face a wide range of challenges such as risks of contagion, job insecurity, psychological distress, and discrimination. Factors associated with migrant workers’ marginal socio-economic status were attributed to these challenges. Several interventions were discussed including increased access to vaccinations, health screening at the border, promotion of hygiene strategies, and financial assistance in medical fees. Discussion: The findings highlight the need for a greater public awareness and stronger response to migrant workers’ wellbeing during an epidemic outbreak. Implications to practice and research were discussed. This review calls for more open-access data to advance research on migrant workers, and evidence-based interventions with a long-term effect. © 2020, International Journal of Wellbeing Charitable Trust.

What leads Indians to participate in clinical trials? A meta-analysis of qualitative studies,"BACKGROUND: With the globalization of clinical trials, large developing nations have substantially increased their participation in multi-site studies. This participation has raised ethical concerns, among them the fear that local customs, habits and culture are not respected while asking potential participants to take part in study. This knowledge gap is particularly noticeable among Indian subjects, since despite the large number of participants, little is known regarding what factors affect their willingness to participate in clinical trials. METHODS: We conducted a meta-analysis of all studies evaluating the factors and barriers, from the perspective of potential Indian participants, contributing to their participation in clinical trials. We searched both international as well as Indian-specific bibliographic databases, including Pubmed, Cochrane, Openjgate, MedInd, Scirus and Medknow, also performing hand searches and communicating with authors to obtain additional references. We enrolled studies dealing exclusively with the participation of Indians in clinical trials. Data extraction was conducted by three researchers, with disagreement being resolved by consensus. RESULTS: Six qualitative studies and one survey were found evaluating the main themes affecting the participation of Indian subjects. Themes included Personal health benefits, Altruism, Trust in physicians, Source of extra income, Detailed knowledge, Methods for motivating participants as factors favoring, while Mistrust on trial organizations, Concerns about efficacy and safety of trials, Psychological reasons, Trial burden, Loss of confidentiality, Dependency issues, Language as the barriers. CONCLUSION: We identified factors that facilitated and barriers that have negative implications on trial participation decisions in Indian subjects. Due consideration and weightage should be assigned to these factors while planning future trials in India.","Shah, Jatin Y; Phadtare, Amruta; Rajgor, Dimple; Vaghasia, Meenakshi; Pradhan, Shreyasee; Zelko, Hilary; Pietrobon, Ricardo",PLoS One,1132
Data on diagnostic performance of stress perfusion cardiac magnetic resonance for coronary artery disease detection at the vessel level,"Stress perfusion cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) has been proposed as an important gatekeeper for invasive coronary angiography (ICA) and percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) in patients evaluated for possible coronary artery disease (CAD) (Fihn et al., 2012; Montalescot et al., 2013) [1], [2]. Several meta-analyses have evaluated the accuracy of stress perfusion CMR to diagnose CAD at the vessel level (Danad et al., 2017; Dai et al., 2016; Jiang et al., 2016; Takx et al., 2015; Li et al., 2015; Desai and Jha, 2013; Jaarsma et al. 2012; Hamon et al., 2010; Nandalur et al. 2007) [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11]. However, they included in the same analysis studies with different definitions of significant CAD (i.e. fractional flow reserve [FFR] < 0.75 and < 0.80 or coronary stenosis ≥ 50% and ≥ 70%), magnetic field strength (1.5 or 3 Tesla [T]), and study protocol (integration or not of late gadolinium enhancement [LGE] into stress perfusion protocol). Data of 34 studies (6091 arteries) have been pooled with the aim of analyzing the accuracy of stress perfusion CMR for the diagnosis of ischemic heart disease at the vessel level according to different definitions of significant CAD, magnetic field strength and study protocol (Arnold et al., 2010; Bettencourt et al., 2013; Cheng et al., 2007; Chiribiri et al., 2013; Cury et al., 2006; De Mello et al., 2012; Donati et al., 2010; Ebersberger et al., 2013; Gebker et al., 2008; Greulich et al., 2015; Hussain et al., 2016; Ishida et al., 2005, 2003; Kamiya et al., 2014; Kitagawa et al., 2008; Klein et al., 2008; Klem et al., 2006; Klumpp et al., 2010; Krittayaphong et al., 2009; Lockie et al., 2011; Ma et al., 2012; Merkle et al., 2007; Meyer et al., 2008; Mor-Avi et al., 2008; Pan et al., 2015; Papanastasiou et al., 2016; Pons Lladó et al., 2004; Sakuma et al., 2005; Salerno et al., 2014; Scheffel et al., 2010; van Werkhoven et al., 2010; Walcher et al., 2013; Watkins et al., 2009; Yun et al., 2015) [12-45].

Enhancing engagement with community sector organisations working in sustainable waste management: A case study,"Voluntary and community sector organisations are increasingly being viewed as key agents of change in the shifts towards the concepts of resource efficiency and circular economy, at the community level. Using a meta-analysis and questionnaire surveys across three towns in the East Midlands of England, namely Northampton, Milton Keynes and Luton, this study aimed to understand public engagement with these organisations. The findings suggest that these organisations play a significant and wide-spread role, not only with regard to sustainable environmental management, but also a social role in community development and regeneration. The surveys indicated that there were generally high levels of awareness of the organisations and strong engagement with them. Clothes were the items most donated. Key reasons for engagement included the financial value offered and the perception that it helped the environment. However, potential limitations in future public engagement were also determined and recommendations for addressing these suggested.","Dururu, John; Anderson, Craig; Bates, Margaret; Montasser, Waleed; Tudor, Terry",Waste Manag.

Being watched: Effects of an audience on eye gaze and prosocial behaviour,"When someone is watching you, you may change your behaviour in various ways: this is called the ‘audience effect’. Social behaviours such as acting prosocially or changing gaze patterns may be used as signals of reputation and thus may be particularly prone to audience effects. The present paper aims to test the relationship between prosocial choices, gaze patterns and the feeling of being watched within a novel ecologically valid paradigm, where participants communicate with a video-clip of a confederate and believe she is (or is not) a live feed of a confederate who can see them back. Results show that when participants believe they are watched, they tend to make more prosocial choices and they gaze less to the confederate. We also find that the increase in prosocial behaviour when being watched correlates with social anxiety traits. Moreover, we show for the first time that prosocial choices influence subsequent gaze patterns of participants, although this is true for both live and pre-recorded interactions. Overall, these findings suggest that the opportunity to signal a good reputation to other people is a key modulator of prosocial decisions and eye gaze in live communicative contexts. They further indicate that gaze should be considered as an interactive and dynamic signal. © 2019 The Authors","Cañigueral, R.; Hamilton, A.F.D.C.",Acta Psychol.,1135
A worldwide review of support mechanisms for car clubs,"Car clubs have operated on a large scale only since 1987, when the first scheme began in Switzerland, although prior to that there were several smaller-scale projects. Schemes then spread to Germany, Austria and the Netherlands. More recently, car clubs have been set up in the UK, Denmark, Italy, and Sweden, and in Canada and the USA. These clubs have developed (and are still developing) in a number of ways. Some schemes are community-level schemes with only one or two vehicles, while others are national organisations with many thousands of members. And some schemes are run by volunteers and are non-profit making, while others are commercial ventures run by international companies. Despite such diverse beginnings, it is clear that the vast majority of schemes face similar problems in becoming established. One major barrier has been the lack of involvement or support from local and national Government. Given the potential benefits of car clubs to deliver environmental and social improvements to communities, this is somewhat surprising. As experience of car clubs spreads, this situation has begun to change and there are signs that Government attitudes across the world are becoming more enthusiastic to the idea of encouraging car clubs. This paper draws on the results of a state-of-the-art review, based on several face-to-face and telephone interviews, email communications, internet sites and existing literature to identify cases where such a change in attitude has occurred, how various levels of Government have translated this into action, and what lessons could be learnt from each example. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Effects of eye images on everyday cooperative behavior: A field experiment,"Laboratory studies have shown that images of eyes can cause people to behave more cooperatively in some economic games, and in a previous experiment, we found that eye images increased the level of contributions to an honesty box. However, the generality and robustness of the eyes effect is not known. Here, we extended our research on the effects of eye images on cooperative behavior to a novel context-littering behavior in a university cafeteria-and attempted to elucidate the mechanism by which they work, by displaying them both in conjunction with, and not associated with, verbal messages to clear one's litter. We found a halving of the odds of littering in the presence of posters featuring eyes, as compared to posters featuring flowers. This effect was independent of whether the poster exhorted litter clearing or contained an unrelated message, suggesting that the effect of eye images cannot be explained by their drawing attention to verbal instructions. There was some support for the hypothesis that eye images had a larger effect when there were few people in the cafÉ than when the cafÉ was busy. Our results confirm that the effects of subtle cues of observation on cooperative behavior can be large in certain real-world contexts. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.","Ernest-Jones, M.; Nettle, D.; Bateson, M.",Evol.

Recombinant activated factor VIIa for the treatment of bleeding in major abdominal surgery including vascular and urological surgery: a review and meta-analysis of published data,"A meta-analysis of case series showed a reduction of bleeding in 73.2% of patients undergoing abdominal surgery. Patients who responded to treatment with recombinant activated factor VII (where bleeding had stopped or was reduced) had a significantly higher probability of survival. Recombinant activated factor VII was not associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism compared with placebo. XCM: This review addressed a clear review question, but the study selection criteria were unclear. Appropriate databases were searched, but neither the fact that placebo-controlled trials were eligible for inclusion, nor what measures were taken to identify conference abstracts, was reported. Few details were provided of the review process, so the risk of reviewer errors and/or bias affecting study selection, assessment of study quality and data extraction was unclear.No quality assessment was reported, and most included studies were case reports or case series (generally considered lower quality evidence than large scale observational data or randomised controlled trials). Sufficient primary study details were reported for case reports and case series, but not for placebo-controlled trials. The method of synthesis generally appeared appropriate, although the stated assumption that the studies identified within the case series were a random sample may not be reliable; the intention to perform a meta-analysis of placebo-controlled studies was not stated at this stage. The results were adequately reported.Overall, as much of the review was unclearly reported and most of the included studies were of uncertain quality, the validity of the conclusions based on these results is unclear. Several of the authors disclosed financial links Novo Nordisk Pharma (manufacturers of rFVIIa drugs and one of the sponsors of the review). XIM: Practice: The authors stated that, if there are not pre-existing coagulation disorders, there are no indications for the prophylactic administration of rFVIIa, but rFVIIa can be considered as an additional therapeutic option if serious bleeding was refractory to conventional treatment. Research: The authors stated that prospective randomised studies are needed to investigate the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of rFVIIa in patients in whom serious bleeding was refractory to conventional treatment, in order to allow a final assessment of the importance of this treatment to be made.","von Heymann, C; Jonas, S; Spies, C; Wernecke, K D; Ziemer, S; Janssen, D; Koscielny, J",,1138
Why do donors donate?,"This chapter brings together different theories that explain motivations of donors to provide financial support to the nonprofit organizations (NPOs) and introduces some variables that explain why some entities obtain more resources than others. For this purpose, the chapter presents a literature review of the most relevant publications in terms of donor motivations, theories on donor behavior, as well as the role of socio-economic factors, welfare state models, and information technologies. Also, it introduces the contribution of different agents around this topic: governments, to supervise and control the NPOs’ activities, and both umbrella and watchdog organizations that facilitate the process of choice for donors, among others. The chapter also reviews the main academic contributions on corporate donors, which varies from commercial motives to increase the company’s profit to striving to contribute to the common good. So, NPOs are facing a constantly growing pressure to find sources of funding for their activities, which emerges as another element of the organization’s global strategy at the service of the social objectives of the entity. © 2020 Taylor & Francis.","Bretos, I.; Díaz-Foncea, M.; Marcuello, C.",Financing Nonprofit Organizations,1139

Noncitizen Voting Rights in the Global Era: a Literature Review and Analysis,"Today, people are moving from countryside to city, city to city, and country to country at one of the highest rates in human history. Globalization, poverty, war, persecution, and environmental crises—as well as the pursuit of safety and better economic opportunities—are propelling a mass migration of people from the Global South to the Global North. In response, some countries have limited immigration directly or restricted certain rights and privileges to discourage immigrants. Conversely, other countries have provided refuge and expanded pathways to rights and benefits out of altruism and humanity, economic self-interest, or both. As the pace of global migration has increased, the idea that political rights should follow or accompany immigrants has also grown and gained traction. Voting is one such right. Most countries typically limit voting rights to its citizens. However, during the past several decades, some have extended the franchise to noncitizen residents. In fact, at least forty-five countries presently allow noncitizen residents to vote in their local, regional, or even national elections. What is driving the expansion of noncitizen voting (NCV)? Where and to what ends are such policies being enacted? For this article, the authors conducted a systematic review to examine these questions and assess the implications of enfranchisement for advancing immigrant incorporation and democratic practice. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Ferris, D; Hayduk, R; Richards, A; Schubert, E S; Acri, M",Journal of International Migration and Integration,1141

Two decades of research comparing for-profit and nonprofit health provider performance in the United States,"Objective. This article reports on a systematic review of data-based, peer-reviewed scientific assessments of performance differences between private for-profit and private nonprofit U.S. health care providers published since 1980. Methods.' Computerized bibliographic searches of all relevant databases yielded 149 studies (179 assessments) that compared the performance of for-profit and nonprofit health care providers on four performance criteria (access, quality, cost/efficiency, and/or amount of charity care). Reported findings on performance were coded in one of three ways: for-profit superiority, nonprofit superiority, or no difference/mixed results. Results. Overall, the nonprofits were judged superior 59 percent of the time, the for-profits superior only 12 percent of the time, and for the rest (29 percent), no difference was found or results were mixed. Conclusions. Caution is warranted on policies that encourage private for-profit entities to replace private nonprofit providers of health care services in the United States.","Rosenau, P V; Linder, S H",Soc. Sci.

Between Karma and Buddha: Prosocial Behavior among Mongolians in an Anonymous Economic Game,"Norenzayan and colleagues argue that culturally evolved beliefs in monitoring and punishing supernatural agents contributed to the expansion of large-scale cooperation. Previous studies showed that Western participants primed with the God concept in anonymous dictator games tended to be more prosocial. However, there is a lack of studies that would investigate karmic beliefs and its effect on pro-sociality, thus expanding the scope of supernatural punishment hypothesis. The current study is one of the first attempts to address the question of belief in karma and its relation to prosocial behavior in a non-Western Buddhist culture. Using karma as a prime and a dictator game to measure generosity, the present study was carried out with Mongolians. Overall, Mongolians were rather generous. While we did not find the effect of the karma prime, there remains a possibility that this effect was masked by overall generosity. However, first, it is argued that the Mongolian Buddhist conceptions of karma (üiliin ür) and merit (buyan), intertwined with nomadic generosity norms, might have facilitated prosocial behavior among Mongolians. Second, results from regression analyses highlighted some variation between self-ascribed Buddhist and non-religious Mongolians, showing that Buddhist participants tended to give slightly more than non-religious participants. Third, the current results also indicate that belief in Buddha with God-like attributes, though espoused by a non-negligible number of Buddhist Mongolians, is not unanimous. And those who expressed this belief were no more generous than those who did not. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Berniūnas, R.; Dranseika, V.; Tserendamba, D.",Int. J. Psychol.

Statistical and measurement pitfalls in the use of meta-regression in meta-analysis,"Purpose: Meta-regression is widely used and misused today in meta-analyses in psychology, organizational behavior, marketing, management, and other social sciences, as an approach to the identification and calibration of moderators, with most users being unaware of serious problems in its use. The purpose of this paper is to describe nine serious methodological problems that plague applications of meta-regression. Design/methodology/approach: This paper is methodological in nature and is based on well-established principles of measurement and statistics. These principles are used to illuminate the potential pitfalls in typical applications of meta-regression. Findings: The analysis in this paper demonstrates that many of the nine statistical and measurement pitfalls in the use of meta-regression are nearly universal in applications in the literature, leading to the conclusion that few meta-regressions in the literature today are trustworthy. A second conclusion is that in almost all cases, hierarchical subgrouping of studies is superior to meta-regression as a method of identifying and calibrating moderators. Finally, a third conclusion is that, contrary to popular belief among researchers, the process of accurately identifying and calibrating moderators, even with the best available methods, is complex, difficult, and data demanding. Practical implications: This paper provides useful guidance to meta-analytic researchers that will improve the practice of moderator identification and calibration in social science research literatures. Social implications: Today, many important decisions are made on the basis of the results of meta-analyses. These include decisions in medicine, pharmacology, applied psychology, management, marketing, social policy, and other social sciences. The guidance provided in this paper will improve the quality of such decisions by improving the accuracy and trustworthiness of meta-analytic results. Originality/value: This paper is original and valuable in that there is no similar listing and discussion of the pitfalls in the use of meta-regression in the literature, and there is currently a widespread lack of knowledge of these problems among meta-analytic researchers in all disciplines. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Schmidt, F.L.",Career Dev.

Body iron stores and heme-iron intake in relation to risk of type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Emerging evidence from biological and epidemiological studies has suggested that body iron stores and heme-iron intake may be related to the risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D). We aimed to examine the association of body iron stores and heme-iron intake with T2D risk by conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis of previously published studies. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Systematic review and subsequent meta-analysis were conducted by searching MEDLINE database up to June 22, 2012 to identify studies that analyzed the association of body iron stores or dietary heme-iron intake with T2D risk. The meta-analysis was performed using the effect estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to calculate the pooled risk estimates, while the heterogeneity among studies was examined using the I(2) and Q statistic. RESULTS: The meta-analysis included 16 high-quality studies: 12 studies analyzed ferritin levels (4,366 T2D patients and 41,091 controls) and 4 measured heme-iron intake (9,246 T2D patients and 179,689 controls). The combined relative risk (RR) comparing the highest and lowest category of ferritin levels was 1.66 (95% CI: 1.15-2.39) for prospective studies, 2.29 (95% CI: 1.48-3.54) for cross-sectional studies with heterogeneity (Q = 14.84, p = 0.01, I(2) = 66.3%; Q = 44.16, p<0.001, I(2) = 88.7%). The combined RR comparing the highest and lowest category of heme-iron intake was 1.31 (95% CI: 1.21-1.43) with heterogeneity (Q = 1.39, p = 0.71, I(2) = 0%). No publication bias was found. Additional 15 studies that were of good quality, had significant results, and analyzed the association between body iron stores and T2D risk were qualitatively included in the systematic review. CONCLUSIONS: The meta-analysis and systematic review suggest that increased ferritin levels and heme-iron intake are both associated with higher risk of T2D.","Zhao, Zhuoxian; Li, Sheyu; Liu, Guanjian; Yan, Fangfang; Ma, Xuelei; Huang, Zeyu; Tian, Haoming",PLoS One,1149
Robot Presence and Human Honesty: Experimental Evidence,"Robots are predicted to serve in environments in which human honesty is important, such as the workplace, schools, and public institutions. Can the presence of a robot facilitate honest behavior? In this paper, we describe an experimental study evaluating the effects of robot social presence on people's honesty. Participants completed a perceptual task, which is structured so as to allow them to earn more money by not complying with the experiment instructions. We compare three conditions between subjects: Completing the task alone in a room; completing it with a non-monitoring human present; and completing it with a non-monitoring robot present. The robot is a new expressive social head capable of 4-DoF head movement and screen-based eye animation, specifically designed and built for this research. It was designed to convey social presence, but not monitoring. We find that people cheat in all three conditions, but cheat equally less when there is a human or a robot in the room, compared to when they are alone. We did not find differences in the perceived authority of the human and the robot, but did find that people felt significantly less guilty after cheating in the presence of a robot as compared to a human. This has implications for the use of robots in monitoring and supervising tasks in environments in which honesty is key. © 2015 ACM.","Hoffman, G.; Forlizzi, J.; Ayal, S.; Steinfeld, A.; Antanitis, J.; Hochman, G.; Hochendoner, E.; Finkenaur, J.",ACM/IEEE Int.

"Parental media monitoring, prosocial violent media exposure, and adolescents' prosocial and aggressive behaviors","Prosocial violent media (e.g., media that combines both violent and prosocial content) is especially popular in entertainment media today. However, it remains unclear how parental media monitoring is associated with exposure to prosocial violent content and adolescent behavior. Accordingly, 1,193 adolescents were asked about parental media monitoring, media content exposure, and behavior. Main findings suggest that autonomy supportive restrictive monitoring was associated with lower levels of exposure to prosocial violent content, but only among older adolescents. Additionally, autonomy supportive restrictive monitoring was the only form of parental media monitoring associated with lower levels of violent content and higher levels of prosocial content, and autonomy supportive active monitoring was the only parental monitoring strategy that promoted prosocial behavior via exposure to prosocial media content. Discussion focuses on the importance of autonomy supportive parental monitoring, as well as the implications of parents encouraging their children to watch media with limited violent content—even if it is prosocial violent content. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Holmgren, H.G.; Padilla-Walker, L.M.; Stockdale, L.A.; Coyne, S.M.",Aggress.

Social heuristics shape intuitive cooperation,"Cooperation is central to human societies. Yet relatively little is known about the cognitive underpinnings of cooperative decision making. Does cooperation require deliberate self-restraint? Or is spontaneous prosociality reined in by calculating self-interest? Here we present a theory of why (and for whom) intuition favors cooperation: cooperation is typically advantageous in everyday life, leading to the formation of generalized cooperative intuitions. Deliberation, by contrast, adjusts behaviour towards the optimum for a given situation. Thus, in one-shot anonymous interactions where selfishness is optimal, intuitive responses tend to be more cooperative than deliberative responses. We test this 'social heuristics hypothesis' by aggregating across every cooperation experiment using time pressure that we conducted over a 2-year period (15 studies and 6,910 decisions), as well as performing a novel time pressure experiment. Doing so demonstrates a positive average effect of time pressure on cooperation. We also find substantial variation in this effect, and show that this variation is partly explained by previous experience with one-shot lab experiments. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.","Rand, D.G.; Peysakhovich, A.; Kraft-Todd, G.T.; Newman, G.E.; Wurzbacher, O.; Nowak, M.A.; Greene, J.D.",Nat.

"Taking, giving, and impure altruism in dictator games","We show that, if giving is equivalent to not taking, impure altruism could account for List’s (in Journal of Political Economy 115(3):482–493, 2007) finding that the payoff to recipients in a dictator game decreases when the dictator has the option to take. We examine behavior in dictator games with different taking options but equivalent final payoff possibilities. We find that recipients tend to earn more as the amount the dictator must take to achieve a given final payoff increases, a result consistent with the hypothesis that the cold prickle of taking is stronger than the warm glow of giving. We conclude that not taking is not equivalent to giving and agree with List (in Journal of Political Economy 115(3):482–493, 2007) that the current social preference models fail to rationalize the observed data. © 2013, Economic Science Association.","Korenok, O.; Millner, E.L.; Razzolini, L.",Exp.

(Un)Informed charitable giving,"Evidence suggests little informed giving. To understand this behavior, we examine voluntary provision of a discrete public good with independent private values that can be ascertained at a cost. We find that an individual who considers a smaller contribution is less likely to learn her value, and thus the percentage of informed giving diminishes as the population grows. We also find that a direct grant to the charity exacerbates crowding-out by discouraging information acquisition whereas a matching grant increases donations by encouraging it. We further show that with costly information, a (first-order) stochastic increase in values can decrease donations; and that facilitating private acquisition of information can be a better fund-raising strategy than directly supplying it. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Krasteva, S.; Yildirim, H.",J.

"Cooperation, Fast and Slow: Meta-Analytic Evidence for a Theory of Social Heuristics and Self-Interested Deliberation","Does cooperating require the inhibition of selfish urges? Or does “rational” self-interest constrain cooperative impulses? I investigated the role of intuition and deliberation in cooperation by meta-analyzing 67 studies in which cognitive-processing manipulations were applied to economic cooperation games (total N = 17,647; no indication of publication bias using Egger’s test, Begg’s test, or p-curve). My meta-analysis was guided by the social heuristics hypothesis, which proposes that intuition favors behavior that typically maximizes payoffs, whereas deliberation favors behavior that maximizes one’s payoff in the current situation. Therefore, this theory predicts that deliberation will undermine pure cooperation (i.e., cooperation in settings where there are few future consequences for one’s actions, such that cooperating is not in one’s self-interest) but not strategic cooperation (i.e., cooperation in settings where cooperating can maximize one’s payoff). As predicted, the meta-analysis revealed 17.3% more pure cooperation when intuition was promoted over deliberation, but no significant difference in strategic cooperation between more intuitive and more deliberative conditions. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","Rand, D.G.",Psychol.

When charity begins at home: How personal financial scarcity drives preference for donating locally at the expense of global concerns,"Research was conducted to understand what drives individuals’ decisions to make charitable donations to local charities versus international charities that serve targets in far-away places. Six experiments using real charities were conducted: in two experiments participants donated their own money and in the other four participants dictated the allocation of money donated by the authors. Results demonstrate that when individuals perceive that their personal financial resources are scarce, their charitable allocations are weighted more heavily towards local charities. A random effects meta-analysis of effect sizes corroborates the robustness of these results. The authors discuss research on social myopia, altruism, and evolutionary psychology to explain charitable priorities, and demonstrate that financial scarcity is an activating agent that drives individuals to prioritize local charities regardless of the importance of the charity and neediness of the beneficiary. The authors further show that the individual's implicit similarity to the target of donation further enhances the effect of personal financial scarcity. The authors present the results within the context of the broader conversation among psychologists and philosophers regarding optimal giving to achieve the greatest social good, suggesting that even a small change in donation allocation has substantial economic consequences for charities far away from home. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Herzenstein, M; Posavac, S S",J.

Wearable computing: Will it make people prosocial?,"We recently reported that people who wear an eye tracker modify their natural looking behaviour in a prosocial manner. This change in looking behaviour represents a potential concern for researchers who wish to use eye trackers to understand the functioning of human attention. On the other hand, it may offer a real boon to manufacturers and consumers of wearable computing (e.g., Google Glass), for if wearable computing causes people to behave in a prosocial manner, then the public's fear that people with wearable computing will invade their privacy is unfounded. Critically, both of these divergent implications are grounded on the assumption that the prosocial behavioural effect of wearing an eye tracker is sustained for a prolonged period of time. Our study reveals that on the very first wearing of an eye tracker, and in less than 10 min, the prosocial effect of an eye tracker is abolished, but by drawing attention back to the eye tracker, the implied presence effect is easily reactivated. This suggests that eye trackers induce a transient social presence effect, which is rendered dormant when attention is shifted away from the source of implied presence. This is good news for researchers who use eye trackers to measure attention and behaviour; and could be bad news for advocates of wearable computing in everyday life. © 2014 The British Psychological Society.","Nasiopoulos, E.; Risko, E.F.; Foulsham, T.; Kingstone, A.",Br.

From good institutions to generous citizens: Top-down incentives to cooperate promote subsequent prosociality but not norm enforcement,"What makes people willing to pay costs to help others, and to punish others’ selfishness? Why does the extent of such behaviors vary markedly across cultures? To shed light on these questions, we explore the role of formal institutions in shaping individuals’ prosociality and punishment. In Study 1 (N = 707), American participants who reported living under higher quality cooperation-enforcing institutions (police and courts) gave significantly more in a Dictator Game (DG), but did not punish significantly more in a Third-Party Punishment Game (TPPG). In Study 1R (N = 1705), we replicated the positive relationship between reported institutional quality and DG giving observed in Study 1. In Study 2 (N = 516), we experimentally manipulated institutional quality in a repeated Public Goods Game with a centralized punishment institution. Consistent with the correlational results of Study 1 and 1R, we found that centralized punishment led to significantly more prosociality in a subsequent DG compared to a no-punishment control, but had no significant direct effect on subsequent TPPG punishment (only an indirect effect via increased DG giving). Thus we present convergent evidence that the quality of institutions one is exposed to “spills over” to subsequent prosociality but not punishment. These findings support a theory of social heuristics, suggest boundary conditions on spillover effects of cooperation, and demonstrate the power of effective institutions for instilling habits of virtue and creating cultures of cooperation. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Stagnaro, M.N.; Arechar, A.A.; Rand, D.G.",Cognition,1162
Effects of a mirror on young children’s transgression in a gift-delay task,"While the development of self-recognition in a mirror by toddlers is well documented, less is known about how the presence of a mirror affects young children’s behaviour. Here, we explored how the presence of a mirror affected 2.5- to 3.5-year-olds’ behaviour in a gift-delay task. Behaviour was assessed for a five-minute test period during which children sat in front of a gift bag that was not to be touched until an experimenter returned. Transgressive behaviour by adults is reduced in the presence of a mirror, so we hypothesized that children faced with a mirror would be less likely to touch the gift than children tested without a mirror. We found that the mirror reduced transgressions in children starting from around 3 years of age. We conclude that the presence of a mirror facilitated self-monitoring in 3-year-old children, such that deviations from a behavioural standard are noticed and corrected immediately. Statement of contribution What is already known on the subject? Children’s self-recognition in a mirror has been well documented. Adults’ behaviour can be affected by the presence of a mirror. There is a lack of research investigating how the presence of a mirror affects young children’s behaviour. What does this study add? We show that the presence of a mirror decreases young children’s likelihood to transgress in a gift-delay task. This effect appears to emerge at around three years of age. These findings raise interesting questions regarding the development of self-awareness and how it relates to other mechanisms. © 2019 The British Psychological Society","Martin, D.U.; Perry, C.; Kaufman, J.",Br.

Inspiring altruism: Reflecting on the personal relevance of emotionally evocative prosocial media characters,"Educators have proposed that admired behavior by media characters evokes audience emulation if subsequent personal reflection results in audience members realizing that they want to and are able to behave in a similar manner. Two experiments investigated this. In Study 1, exposure to prosocial media models increased altruistic inclinations among teenagers only if they were also instructed to reflect on the personal significance of what they had seen. In Study 2, medical students exposed to prosocial media models had higher empathic and altruistic intentions if they reflected on the personal rather than the professional significance of what they had seen. Personal inspiration and recognition of enactment possibilities seemed key determinants of emulation. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Farsides, T.; Pettman, D.; Tourle, L.",J. Appl. Soc.

Group size effects and critical mass in public goods games,"Understanding whether the size of the interacting group has an effect on cooperative behavior has been a major topic of debate since the seminal works on cooperation in the 1960s. Half a century later, scholars have yet to reach a consensus, with some arguing that cooperation is harder in larger groups, while others that cooperation is easier in larger groups, and yet others that cooperation attains its maximum in intermediate size groups. Here we add to this field of work by reporting a two-treatment empirical study where subjects play a Public Goods Game with a Critical Mass, such that the return for full cooperation increases linearly for early contributions and then stabilizes after a critical mass is reached (the two treatments differ only on the critical mass). We choose this game for two reasons: it has been argued that it approximates real-life social dilemmas; previous work suggests that, in this case, group size might have an inverted-U effect on cooperation, where the pick of cooperation is reached around the critical mass. Our main innovation with respect to previous experiments is that we implement a within-subject design, such that the same subject plays in groups of different size (from 5 to 40 subjects). Groups are formed at random at every round and there is no feedback. This allows us to explore if and how subjects change their choice as a function of the size of the group. We report three main results, which partially contrast what has been suggested by previous work: in our setting (i) the critical mass has no effect on cooperation; (ii) group size has a positive effect on cooperation; (iii) the most chosen option (played by about 50% of the subjects) is All Defection, followed by All Cooperation (about 10% of the subjects), whereas the rest have a slight trend to switch preferentially from defection to cooperation as the group size increases. © 2019, The Author(s).","Pereda, M.; Capraro, V.; Sánchez, A.",Sci.

The influence of divine rewards and punishments on religious prosociality,"A common finding across many cultures has been that religious people behave more prosocially than less (or non-) religious people. Numerous priming studies have demonstrated that the activation of religious concepts via implicit and explicit cues (e.g., 'God,' 'salvation,' among many others) increases prosociality in religious people. However, the factors underlying such findings are less clear. In this review we discuss hypotheses (e.g., the supernatural punishment hypothesis) that explain the religion-prosociality link, and also how recent findings in the empirical literature converge to suggest that the divine rewards (e.g., heaven) and punishments (e.g., hell) promised by various religious traditions may play a significant role. In addition, we further discuss inconsistencies in the religion-prosociality literature, as well as existing and future psychological studies which could improve our understanding of whether, and how, concepts of divine rewards and punishments may influence prosociality. © 2016 Saleam and Moustafa.","Saleam, J.; Moustafa, A.A.",Front.

Is Behavioral Ethics Ready for Giving Business and Policy Advice?,"This essay is a critical perspective of the applicability of behavioral ethics in business and policy interventions. I summarize a series of proposed interventions to increase people’s honesty, inspired by ethical dissonance theory, such as increasing salience of moral norms, visibility, and self-engagement. Although I agree that behavioral ethics could offer simple, low-cost interventions with the potential of reducing unethical behavior (not only) in organizations, there are several risks and methodological limitations not sufficiently discussed. The interventions thus could eventually lead to weaker positive impacts or even long-term negative consequences. I suggest several alternative approaches to decrease dishonesty such as making the moral choice easier, implementing salient accountability, and removing dishonesty temptations and dishonest employees. The article concludes with a warning that unrealistic expectations may damage the credibility of behavioral ethics. © The Author(s) 2017.","Houdek, P.",J. Manage. Inq.,1167

A systematic review of laparoscopic live-donor nephrectomy,"BACKGROUND: A systematic review was undertaken to assess the safety and efficacy of laparoscopic live-donor nephrectomy (LLDN) compared with open live-donor nephrectomy (OLDN). METHODS: Literature databases were searched from inception to March 2003 inclusive. Comparative studies of LLDN versus OLDN (randomized and nonrandomized) were included. RESULTS: There were 44 included studies, and the quality of the available evidence was average. There was only one randomized controlled trial and six nonrandomized comparative studies with concurrent controls identified. In terms of safety, for donors, there did not seem to be any distinct difference between the laparoscopic and open approaches. No donor mortality was reported for either procedure, and the complication rates were similar although the types of complications experienced differed between the two procedures. The conversion rate for LLDN to an open procedure ranged from 0% to 13%. In terms of efficacy, LLDN seemed to be a slower operation with longer warm ischemia times than OLDN, but this did not seem to have resulted in increased rates of delayed graft function for recipients. Donor postoperative recovery and convalescence seemed to be superior for LLDN, making it a potentially more attractive operation for living donors. Although in the short-term, graft function and survival did not seem to differ between the two techniques, long-term complication rates and allograft function could not be determined and further long-term follow-up is required. CONCLUSIONS: LLDN seems to be at least as safe and efficacious as OLDN in the short-term. However, it remains a technique in evolution. Further high-quality studies are required to resolve some of the outstanding issues surrounding its use, in particular, long-term follow-up of donor complications and recipient graft function and survival.","Tooher, Rebecca L; Rao, M Mohan; Scott, David F; Wall, Daryl R; Francis, David M A; Bridgewater, Franklin H G; Maddern, Guy J",Transplantation,1169
Applying evolutionary methods in economics: progress or pitfall?,"The Darwinian theory of evolution has arguably become an important building block for experimental and theoretical economists. According to Burnham (J Econ Behav Org 90:S113–S127, 2013), it is possible to formulate novel hypotheses and predictions about human preferences, on the basis of what patterns of behavior would have been adaptive in the ancestral environment. After clarifying two theoretical concepts, the Adaptively Relevant Environment and fitness maximization, I argue that multiple scientifically plausible hypotheses about human preferences are compatible with evolutionary models that target behavior. Moreover, I propose a refinement of Burnham’s method based on theoretical resources provided by the indirect evolutionary approach. Economists apply or build evolutionary models of their own that target particular features of human psychology and cognition. Such models may reduce the number of plausible hypotheses to allow for rigorous scientific testing in laboratory or field experiments. © 2020, The Author(s).","Koliofotis, V.",J. Bioecon.,1170

"Relationships between media use, body fatness and physical activity in children and youth: A meta-analysis","OBJECTIVE: To review the empirical evidence of associations between television (TV) viewing, video/computer game use and (a) body fatness, and (b) physical activity. DESIGN: Meta-analysis. METHOD: Published English-language studies were located from computerized literature searches, bibliographies of primary studies and narrative reviews, and manual searches of personal archives. Included studies presented at least one empirical association between TV viewing, video/computer game use and body fatness or physical activity among samples of children and youth aged 3-18 y. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The mean sample-weighted corrected effect size (Pearson r). RESULTS: Based on data from 52 independent samples, the mean sample-weighted effect size between TV viewing and body fatness was 0.066 (95% CI = 0.056-0.078; total N = 44 707). The sample-weighted fully corrected effect size was 0.084. Based on data from six independent samples, the mean sample-weighted effect size between video/computer game use and body fatness was 0.070 (95% CI = -0.048 to 0.188; total N = 1722). The sample-weighted fully corrected effect size was 0.128. Based on data from 39 independent samples, the mean sample-weighted effect size between TV viewing and physical activity was -0.096 (95% CI = -0.080 to -0.112; total N = 141 505). The sample-weighted fully corrected effect size was -0.129. Based on data from 10 independent samples, the mean sample-weighted effect size between video/computer game use and physical activity was -0.104 (95% CI = -0.080 to -0.128; total N = 119 942). The sample-weighted fully corrected effect size was -0.141. CONCLUSION: A statistically significant relationship exists between TV viewing and body fatness among children and youth although it is likely to be too small to be of substantial clinical relevance. The relationship between TV viewing and physical activity is small but negative. The strength of these relationships remains virtually unchanged even after correcting for common sources of bias known to impact study outcomes. While the total amount of time per day engaged in sedentary behavior is inevitably prohibitive of physical activity, media-based inactivity may be unfairly implicated in recent epidemiologic trends of overweight and obesity among children and youth. Relationships between sedentary behavior and health are unlikely to be explained using single markers of inactivity, such as TV viewing or video/computer game use.","Marshall, S.J.; Biddle, S.J.H.; Gorely, T.; Cameron, N.; Murdey, I.",Int.

Visitors’ pro-environmental behavior and the underlying motivations for natural environment: Merging dual concern theory and attachment theory,"As nature-based tourism has recognized the seriousness of environmental issues, tourists’ pro-environmental behaviors have gained the attention of scholars and practitioners. However, previous empirical studies have not considered motivational factors and destination-related constructs within the tourism context. With the data collected from nature-based tourists, the findings of this study reveal the significant association between personal values and motivations and the significant impact of anticipated positive affect on pro-environmental behavior among nature-based tourists. Also, the findings address that the impact of empathetic concern on pro-environmental behavior is moderated by a level of place attachment to a nature-based destination. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Kim, M.; Koo, D.-W.",J.

Systematic review and metasummary of attitudes toward research in emergency medical conditions,"Emergency departments are challenging research settings, where truly informed consent can be difficult to obtain. A deeper understanding of emergency medical patients' opinions about research is needed. We conducted a systematic review and meta-summary of quantitative and qualitative studies on which values, attitudes, or beliefs of emergent medical research participants influence research participation. We included studies of adults that investigated opinions toward emergency medicine research participation. We excluded studies focused on the association between demographics or consent document features and participation and those focused on non-emergency research. In August 2011, we searched the following databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Google Scholar, Scirus, PsycINFO, AgeLine and Global Health. Titles, abstracts and then full manuscripts were independently evaluated by two reviewers. Disagreements were resolved by consensus and adjudicated by a third author. Studies were evaluated for bias using standardised scores. We report themes associated with participation or refusal. Our initial search produced over 1800 articles. A total of 44 articles were extracted for full-manuscript analysis, and 14 were retained based on our eligibility criteria. Among factors favouring participation, altruism and personal health benefit had the highest frequency. Mistrust of researchers, feeling like a 'guinea pig' and risk were leading factors favouring refusal. Many studies noted limitations of informed consent processes in emergent conditions. We conclude that highlighting the benefits to the participant and society, mitigating risk and increasing public trust may increase research participation in emergency medical research. New methods for conducting informed consent in such studies are needed.","Limkakeng, Alexander T, Jr; de Oliveira, Lucas Lentini Herling; Moreira, Tais; Phadtare, Amruta; Garcia Rodrigues, Clarissa; Hocker, Michael B; McKinney, Ross; Voils, Corrine I; Pietrobon, Ricardo",J.

Financial measures in nonprofit organization research: Comparing IRS 990 return and audited financial statement data,"The IRS 990 Return is becoming an increasingly prominent source of financial data underlying descriptions of the nonprofit sector and studies of nonprofit organizations. However, questions about the quality of the data continue to be of concern. This study of 350 nonprofit organizations investigates the adequacy, reliability, and appropriate interpretation of IRS 990 Return data through comparisons of selected entries with corresponding measures from each organization's audited financial statements. Both quantitative and qualitative methods are used to examine and explain the consistency between the two data sources. The study concludes that the IRS 990 Return can be considered an adequate and reliable source of financial information for many types of investigations, but preparers and users of the data need a clearer understanding of its purposes to enable appropriate interpretations.","Froelich, K.A.; Knoepfle, T.W.; Pollak, T.H.",Nonprofit Volunt.

Building Professionalism in Human Dissection Room as a Component of Hidden Curriculum Delivery: A Systematic Review of Good Practices,"The core values in medical practice which are essential for the humane outlook of a physician are clubbed within the domain of medical professionalism. Professionalism along with other discipline-independent skills (human skills) is propagated implicitly in medical schools as components of a ""hidden curriculum."" Evidence suggests a strong association between ""hidden curriculum"" delivery and development of professionalism in the human dissection room. In this review article, the authors have tried to highlight a few exclusive practices adopted by medical schools which enhance the implementation of the ""hidden curriculum"" within the practice of human dissection and successfully inculcate the key components of professionalism such as integrity, respect, and compassion among students. These distinctive concepts are aimed at humanizing the experience of anatomical dissection by revealing the identity of the donors along with their personal details either through display of video clips of donor interviews, interactions with the family members of the donor over a meal or recognition of the donor as a mentor and organizing memorial services in honor of donors after conclusion of the dissection in the presence of their family members. The resounding success of these good practices in building professionalism among medical students from the onset of the academic curriculum has signaled a new chapter in anatomical sciences education. It has become imperative to recognize the visionary efforts of a select few medical educators and begin incorporating these recent trends into the delivery of the ""hidden curriculum"" within the evolving gross anatomy education model.","Kumar Ghosh, Sanjib; Kumar, Ashutosh",Anat.

"A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of the Effects of Meditation on Empathy, Compassion, and Prosocial Behaviors","Increased attention has focused on methods to increase empathy, compassion, and pro-social behavior. Meditation practices have traditionally been used to cultivate pro-social outcomes, and recently investigations have sought to evaluate their efficacy for these outcomes. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of meditation for pro-social emotions and behavior. A literature search was conducted in PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Embase, and Cochrane databases (inception-April 2016) using the search terms: mindfulness, meditation, mind-body therapies, tai chi, yoga, MBSR, MBCT, empathy, compassion, love, altruism, sympathy, or kindness. Randomized controlled trials in any population were included (26 studies with 1,714 subjects). Most were conducted among healthy adults (n=11) using compassion or loving kindness meditation (n=18) over 8-12weeks (n=12) in a group format (n=17). Most control groups were wait-list or no-treatment (n=15). Outcome measures included self-reported emotions (e.g., composite scores, validated measures) and observed behavioral outcomes (e.g., helping behavior in real-world and simulated settings). Many studies showed a low risk of bias. Results demonstrated small to medium effects of meditation on self-reported (SMD = .40, p < .001) and observable outcomes (SMD = .45, p < .001) and suggest psychosocial and neurophysiological mechanisms of action. Subgroup analyses also supported small to medium effects of meditation even when compared to active control groups. Clinicians and meditation teachers should be aware that meditation can improve positive pro-social emotions and behaviors.","Luberto, Christina M; Shinday, Nina; Song, Rhayun; Philpotts, Lisa L; Park, Elyse R; Fricchione, Gregory L; Yeh, Gloria Y",Mindfulness,1183

The mammography screening controversy: who and what is heard in the press?,"The objective of this project was to analyze newspaper coverage of the January 2000 meta-analysis by Gotzsche and Olsen, 'Is screening for breast cancer with mammography justified?' [Lancet 355 (2000) 129]. A content analysis was performed on a comprehensive set of newspaper clippings from the UK during the 2 weeks following publication of the Lancet article. The original authors were most quoted in Wave 1 (the first weekend); the screening programme was most quoted in Wave 2 (week 2). Screening programme description, and the 'quality' of the Lancet article dominated Wave 1; patient testimonials increased in Wave 2. Newspaper articles were structured as debates between experts and advocates, thereby enhancing polarisation of opinion. We suggest this is counter-productive to evidence-based patient choice and public involvement in decision-making. Medical journals' and charities' press releases that begin to include discussion of uncertainty inherent in medical technologies can contribute to evidence-based public deliberation.

Consistent with economic models of altruism, we found individual perceptions of group potency to be negatively related to individual selling behavior (i.e. making telephone calls and customer visits). Furthermore, individual members' perceptions of group potency were found to interact with two personality traits (conscientiousness and extraversion) to influence individual selling behavior.","Neubert, Mitchell; Taggar, Simon; Cady, Steven",Hum.

Pupil to pupil: The effect of a partner's pupil size on (dis)honest behavior,"Being observed by others fosters honest behavior. In this study, we examine a very subtle eye signal that may affect participants' tendency to behave honestly: observed pupil size. For this, we use an experimental task that is known to evoke dishonest behavior. Specifically, participants made private predictions for a coin toss and earned a bonus by reporting correct predictions. Before reporting the (in)correctness of their predictions, participants viewed videos of partners with dilating or constricting pupils. As dilating pupils are generally perceived positively, we expected that dishonesty would be reduced when participants look into the eyes of a partner with dilating pupils, especially when their own pupil size mimics the observed pupil size. In line with this prediction, Experiments 1 and 2 showed that, when earning a bonus meant harming the interaction partner, dishonesty occurred less frequently when the partner's pupils dilated rather than constricted. That is, when the interests of the self and the other conflict, participants use the pupil of the partner as a social cue to inform their behavior. However, pupil mimicry was not observed. In Experiment 3, we examined pupil mimicry and dishonesty in a context where there was no temptation to hurt the partner. Here, pupil mimicry between partners was observed, but there were no effects of the partner's pupil on dishonesty. Thus, when dishonesty harms the interaction partner, participants use pupillary cues from their partner to inform their behavior. Pupil mimicry, however, is bound to non-competitive contexts only. © 2017","van Breen, J.A.; De Dreu, C.K.W.; Kret, M.E.",J. Exp. Soc. Psychol.,1192
Endogenous testosterone is associated with increased striatal response to audience effects during prosocial choices,"The role of testosterone on cognitive functions in humans remains controversial. One recent hypothesis suggests that this steroid hormone advances social status. As being observed by others is known to modulate a range of behaviors because of image concerns, we hypothesized that such an audience effect might be an important component of status seeking that is under the control of testosterone. Thus, we investigated to which extent testosterone levels are associated with the effect of being observed during prosocial choices and the neural mechanisms underlying this effect. We enrolled twenty-four male participants, aged 22.47 ± 2.62 years, in an fMRI experiment to examine the relationship between testosterone levels and brain activity engaged in deciding whether to accept or reject monetary transfers to two types of organizations (a positively evaluated organization and a negatively evaluated organization) in presence or absence of an audience. When comparing the public to the private condition, the rate of acceptance increased for the positively evaluated organization, while the rate of rejection increased for the negatively evaluated one. Higher testosterone levels were linked to greater activation in the striatum in the public compared to the private condition, regardless of the organization type. These results indicate a relationship between testosterone levels and striatal activity induced by the audience effect. These findings provide new insights on the role of testosterone in human social behavior. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Li, Y.; Météreau, E.; Obeso, I.; Butera, L.; Villeval, M.C.; Dreher, J.-C.",Psychoneuroendocrinology,1193

Do watching eyes affect charitable giving? Evidence from a field experiment,"The presence of implicit observation cues, such as picture of eyes, has been shown to increase generosity in dictator games, and cooperative behavior in field settings. I combine these approaches, by testing if a picture of watching eyes affects unconditional giving in a natural environment, where the recipient is a charity organization. Taken together, this study reduces the influence of three potential confounding factors in previous experiments: (i) experimenter demand effects, (ii) that the facial cue reminds subjects of a human counterpart, and (iii) a social multiplier effect. Specifically, the paper reports results from an experiment, conducted in a Swedish supermarket chain, where customers face a naturally occurring decision problem. People who recycle cans and bottles have to choose whether to keep the recycled amount or donate it to a charity organization. By posting a picture of human eyes on recycling machines, I am able to test whether this causes an increase in donations to the charity. Based on a sample covering a 12-day period, 38 stores and 16775 individual choices, I find no general effect. However, when controlling for store and day fixed effects, and using a proxy for store attendance, the picture of eyes increased donated amount by 30 percent during days when relatively few other people visited the store. This result gives further support to the conclusion that subtle social cues can invoke reputation concerns in humans, although the relatively small effect suggests that previous estimates could be biased upward, or at least that the influence of observational cues is context dependent. © 2011 Economic Science Association.","Ekström, M.",Exp.

The use of metacommunication in compliance: Door-in-the-face and single-request strategies,"Investigation of compliance techniques has generally overlooked a dynamic involving a target's dilemma over directly commenting about the imposition of the requester's behavior. Such behavior is generally classified as being metacommunicative in nature. In two studies, the authors tested the hypothesis that compliance can be enhanced when the target is asked to metacommunicate about the appropriateness of an imposition in order to refuse it. American participants were exposed to door-in-the-face (DITF) and single-request strategies that used either metacommunicative or standard language. Although metacommunicative DITF strategies yielded significant compliance effects, the obtained levels were not significantly greater than those of standard DITF strategies. However, when communication style (metacommunicative language) was considered independent of strategy, significant overall effects were found. Therefore, the use of metacommunicative binds in the language of single requests may facilitate compliance. © 1997 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Patch, M.E.; Hoang, V.R.; Stahelski, A.J.",J. Soc.

Compliance in autism: Self-report in action,"Previous research indicates that autistic individuals are more likely to be bullied, and that they experience heightened anxiety and diminished self-esteem. These factors are known to predict heightened compliance, which is the tendency to agree with or carry out the requests and demands of others. This has a range of potentially serious consequences, particularly for an autistic person. This study utilised self-report (the Gudjonsson Compliance Scale) and behavioural measures of compliance (the door-in-the-face task) with 26 autistic and 26 typically developing adults. Participants also completed measures of early life bullying experiences, anxiety and self-esteem. Autistic participants were more compliant on both self-report and experimental tasks, and they reported more bullying experiences, higher anxiety and reduced self-esteem. Looking at both groups, bullying, anxiety and self-esteem were all correlated with self-reported compliance on the Gudjonsson Compliance Scale, yet only self-esteem was a unique predictor. None of these predictor variables related to behavioural compliance on the door in the face; nor did Gudjonsson Compliance Scale scores predict door-in-the-face performance, which may be better explained by situational and motivational factors. Findings have important implications for a range of real-life settings including requests made in the context of research, schools, the criminal justice system and the workplace. © The Author(s) 2018.","Chandler, R.J.; Russell, A.; Maras, K.L.",Autism,1199

Wishful seeing: More desired objects are seen as closer,"Although people assume that they see the surrounding environment as it truly is, we suggest that perception of the natural environment is dependent upon the internal goal states of perceivers. Five experiments demonstrated that perceivers tend to see desirable objects (i.e., those that can fulfill immediate goals-a water bottle to assuage their thirst, money they can win, a personality test providing favorable feedback) as physically closer to them than less desirable objects. Biased distance perception was revealed through verbal reports and through actions toward the object (e.g., underthrowing a beanbag at a desirable object). We suggest that seeing desirable objects as closer than less desirable objects serves the self-regulatory function of energizing the perceiver to approach objects that fulfill needs and goals. © The Author(s) 2010.","Balcetis, E.; Dunning, D.",Psychol.

Perceived Utility (not Sympathy) Mediates the Proportion Dominance Effect in Helping Decisions,"The proportion dominance effect (PDE) refers to a higher motivation to help when the victims are part of a small (you can help 56 out of 60) rather than a large (you can help 56 out of 560) reference group. In two studies using different experimental paradigms, we investigated possible mediators of the PDE. Study 1 (N=168) was conducted in three separate steps in order to test each link of the mediator model independently. Students read six vignettes where it was possible to help a fixed number of victims but where the size of the reference group was either small or large. When the reference group was small, helping motivation and perceived utility were higher, whereas sympathy toward the victims and perceived rights were not. A within-subject mediation analysis showed that perceived utility mediated the PDE. Study 2 (N=36) presented four versions of a single helping situation in a joint evaluation mode where the size of the reference group became gradually smaller in each version. All participants compared and responded to each version. Helping motivation increased as the reference group became smaller, and this effect was mediated by perceived utility rather than by distress, sympathy, or perceived responsibilities. Our results suggest that unlike, for example, the identifiability and singularity effects, which have been suggested to be mediated by emotional reactions, the PDE is mediated by perceived utility. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Erlandsson, A.; Björklund, F.; Bäckström, M.",J.

Psychological Impact of Deploying in Support of the U.S. Response to Ebola: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Past Outbreaks,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the potential psychological impact of deploying in support of the U.S. response to Ebola in west Africa by systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: Peer-reviewed articles published between January 2000 and December 2014 were identified using PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science. Thirty-two studies involving 26,869 persons were included in the systematic review; 13 studies involving 7,785 persons were included in the meta-analysis. Pooled standardized mean differences (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. RESULTS: Reflecting the sociodemographics of the military, those who are younger, single, not living with family, have fewer years of work experience, lower education, and lower income are at increased risk for psychological distress, alcohol/drug misuse, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and/or anxiety as a result of their perceived risk of infection. Effect sizes for post-traumatic stress disorder, depressive, and anxiety symptoms were considered small (SMD = 0.12, 95% CI = -0.23 to 0.47), moderate (SMD = 0.40, 95% CI = 0.24-0.51), and small (SMD = 0.08, 95% CI = -0.09 to 0.25), respectively; however, only the effect size for depressive symptoms was statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Deployed service members may return with clinically significant problems, the most notable of which is depression. Delivering resilience training and fostering altruistic acceptance may protect service members from developing mental health disorders.","Vyas, Kartavya J; Delaney, Eileen M; Webb-Murphy, Jennifer A; Johnston, Scott L",Mil.

Elements of Trust in Digital Health Systems: Scoping Review,"BACKGROUND: Information and communication technologies have long become prominent components of health systems. Rapid advances in digital technologies and data science over the last few years are predicted to have a vast impact on health care services, configuring a paradigm shift into what is now commonly referred to as digital health. Forecasted to curb rising health costs as well as to improve health system efficiency and safety, digital health success heavily relies on trust from professional end users, administrators, and patients. Yet, what counts as the building blocks of trust in digital health systems has so far remained underexplored. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to analyze what relevant stakeholders consider as enablers and impediments of trust in digital health. METHODS: We performed a scoping review to map out trust in digital health. To identify relevant digital health studies, we searched 5 electronic databases. Using keywords and Medical Subject Headings, we targeted all relevant studies and set no boundaries for publication year to allow a broad range of studies to be identified. The studies were screened by 2 reviewers after which a predefined data extraction strategy was employed and relevant themes documented. RESULTS: Overall, 278 qualitative, quantitative, mixed-methods, and intervention studies in English, published between 1998 and 2017 and conducted in 40 countries were included in this review. Patients and health care professionals were the two most prominent stakeholders of trust in digital health; a third-health administrators-was substantially less prominent. Our analysis identified cross-cutting personal, institutional, and technological elements of trust that broadly cluster into 16 enablers (altruism, fair data access, ease of use, self-efficacy, sociodemographic factors, recommendation by other users, usefulness, customizable design features, interoperability, privacy, initial face-to-face contact, guidelines for standardized use, stakeholder engagement, improved communication, decreased workloads, and service provider reputation) and 10 impediments (excessive costs, limited accessibility, sociodemographic factors, fear of data exploitation, insufficient training, defective technology, poor information quality, inadequate publicity, time-consuming, and service provider reputation) to trust in digital health. CONCLUSIONS: Trust in digital health technologies and services depends on the interplay of a complex set of enablers and impediments. This study is a contribution to ongoing efforts to understand what determines trust in digital health according to different stakeholders. Therefore, it offers valuable points of reference for the implementation of innovative digital health services. Building on insights from this study, actionable metrics can be developed to assess the trustworthiness of digital technologies in health care.","Adjekum, Afua; Blasimme, Alessandro; Vayena, Effy",J.

"Effects of HIV counseling and testing on sexual risk behavior: a meta-analytic review of published research, 1985-1997","OBJECTIVES: This study examined whether HIV counseling and testing leads to reductions in sexual risk behavior. METHODS: The meta-analysis included 27 published studies that provided sexual behavior outcome data, assessed behavior before and after counseling and testing, and provided details sufficient for the calculation of effect sizes. The studies involved 19,597 participants. RESULTS: After counseling and testing, HIV-positive participants and HIV-serodiscordant couples reduced unprotected intercourse and increased condom use more than HIV-negative and untested participants. HIV-negative participants did not modify their behavior more than untested participants. Participants' age, volition for testing, and injection drug use treatment status, as well as the sample seroprevalence and length of the follow-up, explained the variance in results. CONCLUSIONS: HIV counseling and testing appears to provide an effective means of secondary prevention for HIV-positive individuals but, as conducted in the reviewed studies, is not an effective primary prevention strategy for uninfected participants. Theory-driven research with attention given to the context of testing is needed to further explicate the determinants of behavior change resulting from HIV counseling and testing, and the effectiveness of specific counseling approaches.","Weinhardt, L S; Carey, M P; Johnson, B T; Bickham, N L",Am.

Review and Analysis of Publication Trends over Three Decades in Three High Impact Medicine Journals,"CONTEXT: Over the past three decades, industry sponsored research expanded in the United States. Financial incentives can lead to potential conflicts of interest (COI) resulting in underreporting of negative study results. OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that over the three decades, there would be an increase in: a) reporting of conflict of interest and source of funding; b) percentage of randomized control trials c) number of patients per study and d) industry funding. DATA SOURCES AND STUDY SELECTION: Original articles published in three calendar years (1988, 1998, and 2008) in The Lancet, New England Journal of Medicine and Journal of American Medical Association were collected. DATA EXTRACTION: Studies were reviewed and investigational design categorized as prospective and retrospective clinical trials. Prospective trials were categorized into randomized or non-randomized and single-center or multi-center trials. Retrospective trials were categorized as registries, meta-analyses and other studies, mostly comprising of case reports or series. Study outcomes were categorized as positive or negative depending on whether the pre-specified hypothesis was met. Financial disclosures were researched for financial relationships and profit status, and accordingly categorized as government, non-profit or industry sponsored. Studies were assessed for reporting COI. RESULTS: 1,671 original articles were included in this analysis. Total number of published studies decreased by 17% from 1988 to 2008. Over 20 year period, the proportion of prospective randomized trials increased from 22 to 46% (p < 0.0001); whereas the proportion of prospective non-randomized trials decreased from 59% to 27% (p < 0.001). There was an increase in the percentage of prospective randomized multi-center trials from 11% to 41% (p < 0.001). Conversely, there was a reduction in non-randomized single-center trials from 47% to 10% (p < 0.001). Proportion of government funded studies remained constant, whereas industry funded studies more than doubled (17% to 40%; p < 0.0001). The number of studies with negative results more than doubled (10% to 22%; p<0.0001). While lack of funding disclosure decreased from 35% to 7%, COI reporting increased from 2% to 84% (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Improved reporting of COI, clarity in financial sponsorship, increased publication of negative results in the setting of larger and better designed clinical trials represents a positive step forward in the scientific publications, despite the higher percentage of industry funded studies.","Ivanov, Alexander; Kaczkowska, Beata A; Khan, Saadat A; Ho, Jean; Tavakol, Morteza; Prasad, Ashok; Bhumireddy, Geetha; Beall, Allan F; Klem, Igor; Mehta, Parag; Briggs, William M; Sacchi, Terrence J; Heitner, John F",PLoS One,1209

“Green to be seen” and “brown to keep down”: Visibility moderates the effect of identity on pro-environmental behavior,"Social identities predict pro-environmental behavior, but the strength may depend on whether the behavior is visible to others. When an environmentalist considers a pro-environmental behavior such as carrying reusable grocery bags, being observed by others may motivate signaling the valued group membership and may increase behavior (“green to be seen”). When an anti-environmentalist considers a pro-environmental behavior that signals an unwanted social identity, being observed may lead to less behavior (“brown to keep down”). United States residents completed three correlational surveys (total N = 1126) of identity, visibility, and self-reported behavior frequency using the Recurring Pro-environmental Behavior Scale. Three multilevel studies revealed that environmentalist identity predicted pro-environmental behavior more strongly for high-visibility behaviors, controlling for confounds at the person level (attitudes, political identity) and the behavior level (difficulty, effectiveness). This research helps uncover the key social identities and contextual factors that lead individuals to embrace or reject pro-environmental behaviors. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Brick, C.; Sherman, D.K.; Kim, H.S.",J.

The limited prosocial effects of meditation: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Many individuals believe that meditation has the capacity to not only alleviate mental-illness but to improve prosociality. This article systematically reviewed and meta-analysed the effects of meditation interventions on prosociality in randomized controlled trials of healthy adults. Five types of social behaviours were identified: compassion, empathy, aggression, connectedness and prejudice. Although we found a moderate increase in prosociality following meditation, further analysis indicated that this effect was qualified by two factors: type of prosociality and methodological quality. Meditation interventions had an effect on compassion and empathy, but not on aggression, connectedness or prejudice. We further found that compassion levels only increased under two conditions: when the teacher in the meditation intervention was a co-author in the published study; and when the study employed a passive (waiting list) control group but not an active one. Contrary to popular beliefs that meditation will lead to prosocial changes, the results of this meta-analysis showed that the effects of meditation on prosociality were qualified by the type of prosociality and methodological quality of the study. We conclude by highlighting a number of biases and theoretical problems that need addressing to improve quality of research in this area.","Kreplin, Ute; Farias, Miguel; Brazil, Inti A",Sci.

The influence of enlightenment on compliance,"The effect of knowledge of compliance principles on subsequent behavior was investigated in three groups of 35 adult Americans. One group read portions of a study on the door-in-the-face technique, another read about the low-ball technique, and the third group, the control condition, read a topic not related to compliance. Immediately afterward, the two compliance techniques and a target-request-only procedure were employed in asking the groups to complete a math test and, during a follow-up telephone call 2 weeks later, to participate in a phone survey. There were no differences between the groups in accepting the math test or completing the phone survey. However, there was a significant overall effect of information on returning the math test. In some comparisons, knowledge of the door-in-the-face technique decreased compliance, while in others information about the low-ball technique increased it. © 1989 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Katzev, R.; Brownstein, R.",J.

Social Environment Shapes the Speed of Cooperation,"Are cooperative decisions typically made more quickly or slowly than non-cooperative decisions? While this question has attracted considerable attention in recent years, most research has focused on one-shot interactions. Yet it is repeated interactions that characterize most important real-world social interactions. In repeated interactions, the cooperativeness of one's interaction partners (the ""social environment"") should affect the speed of cooperation. Specifically, we propose that reciprocal decisions (choices that mirror behavior observed in the social environment), rather than cooperative decisions per se, occur more quickly. We test this hypothesis by examining four independent decision time datasets with a total of 2,088 subjects making 55,968 decisions. We show that reciprocal decisions are consistently faster than non-reciprocal decisions: cooperation is faster than defection in cooperative environments, while defection is faster than cooperation in non-cooperative environments. These differences are further enhanced by subjects' previous behavior-reciprocal decisions are faster when they are consistent with the subject's previous choices. Finally, mediation analyses of a fifth dataset suggest that the speed of reciprocal decisions is explained, in part, by feelings of conflict-reciprocal decisions are less conflicted than non-reciprocal decisions, and less decision conflict appears to lead to shorter decision times.","Nishi, A.; Christakis, N.A.; Evans, A.M.; O'Malley, A.J.; Rand, D.G.",Sci.

Do women behave more reciprocally than men? Gender differences in real effort dictator games,"We analyze dictator allocation decisions in an experiment where the recipients have to earn the pot to be divided with a real-effort task. As the recipients move before the dictators, their effort decisions resemble the first move in a trust game. Depending on the recipients' performance, the size of the pot is either high or low. We compare this real-effort treatment to a baseline treatment where the pot is a windfall gain and where a lottery determines the pot size. In the baseline treatment, reciprocity cannot play a role. We find that female dictators show reciprocity and decrease their taking-rates significantly in the real-effort treatment. This treatment effect is larger when female dictators make a decision on recipients who successfully generated a large pot compared to the case where the recipients performed poorly. By contrast, there is no treatment effect with male dictators, who generally exhibit more selfish behavior. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Heinz, M.; Juranek, S.; Rau, H.A.",J. Econ. Behav. Organ.,1222
Nonprofits and public administration: Reconciling performance management and citizen engagement,"Nonprofit organizations receiving government contracts are now central to the provision of a host of public services, including community care, workforce development, substance abuse treatment, and early childhood education. Government's increased dependence on nonprofits has in turn prompted more intensive efforts to hold nonprofit service organizations accountable for the expenditure of public funds, especially through greater regulation such as performance-based contracting. Overall, these regulatory strategies do not directly address the governance of nonprofits or their engagement with the community and citizens; instead, the focus of performance management is on government programmatic priorities. The central argument of this article is that the inattention to governance and citizen engagement can undermine good performance and program sustainability. Consequently, this article offers a framework for government and nonprofit managers to integrate performance management and citizen engagement. This approach requires a more inclusive performance management strategy that emphasizes programmatic goals as well as sound governance and ongoing support for citizen participation. Indeed, only by close attention to community and citizenship, broadly defined, can the promise of innovation and performance by nonprofits be effectively realized. © 2010 The Author(s).","Smith, S.R.",Am.

Prosocial behavior: Multilevel perspectives,"Current research on prosocial behavior covers a broad and diverse range of phenomena. We argue that this large research literature can be best organized and understood from a multilevel perspective. We identify three levels of analysis of prosocial behavior: (a) the ""meso"" level - the study of helper-recipient dyads in the context of a specific situation; (b) the micro level - the study of the origins of prosocial tendencies and the sources of variation in these tendencies; and (c) the macro level - the study of prosocial actions that occur within the context of groups and large organizations. We present research at each level and discuss similarities and differences across levels. Finally, we consider ways in which theory and research at these three levels of analysis might be combined in future intra- and interdisciplinary research on prosocial behavior.","Penner, L.A.; Dovidio, J.F.; Piliavin, J.A.; Schroeder, D.A.",Annu.

I estimate price elasticities of -0.94 to -1.15 and income elasticities of 0.24 to 0.35. Although the price elasticity estimates are smaller than those found in early studies, they do imply that the charitable deduction has a substantial impact on charitable giving. I also find that respondents' own reports of their sensitivity to tax deductions corroborate the price elasticity estimates. Those who report being most influenced by tax deductions have the highest price elasticity and those who report being least sensitive to tax deductions have the lowest price elasticity.","Tiehen, L.",Natl.

Carrying Flowers on a City Street Increases Others' Spontaneous Helping Behavior,"Several studies have shown the psychological benefits of plants on people's health, emotions, and well-being. However, the effect of flowers on social relations, and particularly helping behavior, has never been tested. In three field studies, confederates held a bunch of flowers or a T-shirt, or they had nothing in their hands while walking in a shopping mall and accidentally dropping a card-holder on the floor (Study 1) or while waiting at a pedestrian crossing (Study 2). Results showed that more participants warned the confederates of their loss and more drivers stopped when the confederates held a bunch of flowers. This effect of the presence of flowers was found with both male and female participants. In Study 3, we compared the effect of a potted plant to that of flowers and observed a significant effect of flowers only. The positive emotions associated with the presence of flowers and their symbolism were used to explain our results. © Copyright 2015, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.","Guéguen, N.; Stefan, J.; Ruiz, C.",Ecopsychology,1228
Nudging pro-environmental behavior: evidence from a web experiment on priming and WTP,"Investigations on state-dependent and endogenous preferences have gained momentum. There is now abundant empirical literature on whether, and how, external stimuli influence or predict people’s behavior and appraisals. In recent decades, attempts have been made to enlarge this strand of research to determine whether “nudging” may help in managing environmental problems and boosting social preferences. Following this line of investigation, we describe a web experiment to analyze the impact of priming on environmental and ethical attitudes and willingness to pay (WTP) for environmental protection. We found that while priming does make pro-environmental attitudes more salient, its frame affects the probability of WTP a premium for environment-friendly goods and the size of the premium. Unlike other authors, we used a visual priming technique based on a short video cartoon about a smartphone lifecycle. © 2019, © 2019 Newcastle University.","Bimonte, S.; Bosco, L.; Stabile, A.",J.

We measure fundraising efficiency using a Bayesian estimation approach using the stochastic frontier production model. We show that fundraising efficiencies are generally quite low for art organizations in the U. S. when private giving is only considered as a fundraising output; however, when the effect of fundraising on ticket sales is considered, fundraising efficiencies improve substantially. We also show that government grants have a negative impact on fundraising efficiency and therefore partially crowd out private giving. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Song, S.; Yi, D.T.",J.

Using 36 correlations derived from 20 published studies, the review finds a positive relationship between size and innovation. In addition, an examination of the effects of several moderating factors indicates that: (1) size is more positively related to innovation in manufacturing and profit- making organizations than in service and non-profit-making organizations; (2) the association between size and innovation is stronger when a non-personnel or a log transformation measure of size is used, than when a personnel or a raw measure of size is used; (3) types of innovation do not have a considerable moderating effect on the relationship between size and innovation; and (4) size is more strongly related to the implementation than to the initiation of innovations in organizations. The implications of the findings for theory development and future research are discussed. © 1992, Sage Publications. All rights reserved.","Damanpour, Fariborz",Organization Studies,1235
Effects of prosocial cartoon models on aggressive cognitions and aggressive behaviors,"Although research has examined violent cartoon effects, little research has evaluated the effects of prosocial cartoons on kindergartners. Based on the general learning model (GLM) and social learning model (SLM), we examined how prosocial cartoon models affect aggressive cognitions and aggressive behaviors. A total of 174 children aged 5 and 6 years (50% girls) who had been nominated by their teacher and peers as aggressive were recruited from three Chinese kindergartens. Half of them were assigned to the experimental group to watch prosocial cartoons for five consecutive days, while the other half were assigned to the control group that did not watch cartoons. The modified semantic classification task (MSCT) and the competitive reaction time task (CRTT) were employed to measure aggressive cognitions and aggressive behaviors. Children who watched the prosocial cartoons displayed lower aggressive cognitions and aggressive behaviors than those who did not watch the cartoons. Specifically, watching prosocial cartoons reduced aggressive cognitions and aggressive behaviors more for boys than girls. Aggressive cognitions partially mediated the effect of prosocial cartoon viewing on aggressive behaviors. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Zhang, Q.; Cao, Y.; Tian, J.; El-Lim, K.; Gentile, D.A.",Child.

A Web-Based Psychoeducational Intervention for Adolescent Depression: Design and Development of MoodHwb,"BACKGROUND: Depression is common in adolescence and leads to distress and impairment in individuals, families and carers. Treatment and prevention guidelines highlight the key role of information and evidence-based psychosocial interventions not only for individuals but also for their families and carers. Engaging young people in prevention and early intervention programs is a challenge, and early treatment and prevention of adolescent depression is a major public health concern. There has been growing interest in psychoeducational interventions to provide accurate information about health issues and to enhance and develop self-management skills. However, for adolescents with, or at high risk of depression, there is a lack of engaging Web-based psychoeducation programs that have been developed with user input and in line with research guidelines and targeted at both the individual and their family or carer. There are also few studies published on the process of development of Web-based psychoeducational interventions. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to describe the process underlying the design and development of MoodHwb (HwbHwyliau in Welsh): a Web-based psychoeducation multimedia program for young people with, or at high risk of, depression and their families, carers, friends, and professionals. METHODS: The initial prototype was informed by (1) a systematic review of psychoeducational interventions for adolescent depression; (2) findings from semistructured interviews and focus groups conducted with adolescents (with depressive symptoms or at high risk), parents or carers, and professionals working with young people; and (3) workshops and discussions with a multimedia company and experts (in clinical, research, and multimedia work). Twelve interviews were completed (four each with young people, parents or carers, and professionals) and six focus groups (three with young people, one with parents and carers, one with professionals, and one with academics). RESULTS: Key themes from the interviews and focus groups were: aims of the program, design and content issues, and integration and context of the program. The prototype was designed to be person-centered, multiplatform, engaging, interactive, and bilingual. It included mood-monitoring and goal-setting components and was available as a Web-based program and an app for mobile technologies. CONCLUSIONS: MoodHwb is a Web-based psychoeducational intervention developed for young people with, or at high risk of, depression and their families and carers. It was developed with user input using qualitative methods as well as user-centered design and educational and psychological theory. Further research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of the program in a randomized controlled trial. If found to be effective, it could be implemented in health, education, youth and social services, and charities, to not only help young people but also families, carers, friends, and professionals involved in their care.","Bevan Jones, Rhys; Thapar, Anita; Rice, Frances; Beeching, Harriet; Cichosz, Rachel; Mars, Becky; Smith, Daniel J; Merry, Sally; Stallard, Paul; Jones, Ian; Thapar, Ajay K; Simpson, Sharon A",JMIR Ment Health,1237

Understanding obstacles preventing compliance: Conceptualization and classification,"Although the obstacle hypothesis has proven useful in understanding communication choices during request sequences, its utility is limited by the lack of explication of the obstacle construct. This article examines the types of obstacles that may be perceived and dimensions that differentiate them. Results suggest that six types of obstacles - possession, imposition, inappropriateness, postpone, no incentive, and recalcitrance - are perceived by individuals in request interactions. These obstacles appear to be distinguishable in the degree to which they reflect unwillingness to comply, inability to comply, and personal characteristics of the requester. The discussion section explores the implications of this conceptualization on understanding request interactions.","Ifert, D.E.; Roloff, M.E.",Commun. Res.,1240
Leader development for adolescent girls: State of the field and a framework for moving forward,"For most leaders, their first exposure to formal leader development training occurs in adolescence, through school, extra-curricular activities, or youth leader development programs. As with many adolescent experiences, the processes and challenges of leader development are different for girls than they are for boys. With increasing calls to address gender inequity worldwide, adolescent girls' leader development has become an important cross-disciplinary research topic. Though the literature on developing adolescent girls has grown substantially, it is fragmented across disciplines, with a lack of integration and theoretical framing hindering our advancement in knowledge. Therefore, there is a critical need for a comprehensive review article to guide scholars to build an integrated knowledge of how leader development occurs for adolescent girls. We searched for literature relevant to leader and leadership development designed for adolescent girls and reviewed a total of 108 academic papers (2000–2019). We identify and critique five themes in this literature that hold important implications for the leader development of adolescent girls. To advance knowledge, we offer social cognitive theory as a theoretical frame to understand adolescent girls' leader development and provide guidance on future research. Finally, we offer insights on how the processes and practices of adolescent girls' leader development could inform adult leader development. © 2020","Eva, N.; De Cieri, H.; Murphy, S.E.; Lowe, K.B.",Leadersh.

Policy and Prevention Approaches for Disordered and Hazardous Gaming and Internet Use: an International Perspective,"Problems related to high levels of gaming and Internet usage are increasingly recognized as a potential public health burden across the developed world. The aim of this review was to present an international perspective on prevention strategies for Internet gaming disorder and related health conditions (e.g., Internet addiction), as well as hazardous gaming and Internet use. A systematic review of quantitative research evidence was conducted, followed by a search of governmental reports, policy and position statements, and health guidelines in the last decade. The regional scope included the USA, UK, Australia, China, Germany, Japan, and South Korea. Prevention studies have mainly involved school-based programs to train healthier Internet use habits in adolescents. The efficacy of selective prevention is promising but warrants further empirical attention. On an international scale, the formal recognition of gaming or Internet use as a disorder or as having quantifiable harms at certain levels of usage has been foundational to developing structured prevention responses. The South Korean model, in particular, is an exemplar of a coordinated response to a public health threat, with extensive government initiatives and long-term strategic plans at all three levels of prevention (i.e., universal, selective, and indicated). Western regions, by comparison, are dominated by prevention approaches led by non-profit organizations and private enterprise. The future of prevention of gaming and Internet problems ultimately relies upon all stakeholders working collaboratively in the public interest, confronting the reality of the evidence base and developing practical, ethical, and sustainable countermeasures.","King, Daniel L; Delfabbro, Paul H; Doh, Young Yim; Wu, Anise M S; Kuss, Daria J; Pallesen, Ståle; Mentzoni, Rune; Carragher, Natacha; Sakuma, Hiroshi",Prev.

Barriers and facilitators to implementing evidence-based interventions among third sector organisations: a systematic review,"BACKGROUND: The third sector is becoming a growing provider of public, social, and health services. However, there is little evidence on the effectiveness of third sector organisations (TSOs), and their capacity to implement evidence-based interventions (EBIs). Understanding implementation aspects of service delivery remains an important issue in clinical practice, but is poorly understood in the context of TSOs. This is problematic, since implementation issues are known to be critical for effective intervention outcomes. OBJECTIVES: To identify and synthesise existing research on what barriers and facilitators influence the implementation process of TSOs delivering EBIs. METHODS: This review is reported according to PRISMA guidelines and was pre-registered in PROSPERO. Key databases were searched using relevant terms, experts in the field were contacted, and websites were reviewed. All identified studies were double-screened, and data were extracted independently by two authors. Included studies were synthesised using thematic analysis and were quality appraised. RESULTS: Thirty-one studies were included, most of which were conducted in North America. The thematic synthesis identified resource limitations, in particular staff and finance, to be the most reported barrier to TSOs implementing EBIs. Organisational culture, including factors such as alignment between the mission of the TSO and EBI, and support/prioritisation of the implementation process were the most reported facilitators. These findings generalise across the included studies and are robust to study quality assessment. CONCLUSIONS: While it is often assumed that good outcomes follow when implementing interventions that have been developed and tested according to best practice, little attention has been paid to how EBIs are best transported, contextualised, and implemented by third sector providers. This systematic review found that TSOs faced considerable challenges in implementing EBIs, which were primarily a lack of support and expertise, and unclear/insufficient guidelines on how to adapt EBIs to different populations. To address these challenges, it is important to engage with central stakeholders, such as funders, researchers, policymakers, and practitioners, to discuss how these needs can be met.

Where is the apathetic bystander? Situational characteristics of the emergency,"Investigated the effects of ambiguity of an emergency and potential cost of intervention for a bystander(s) on helping behavior in 2 experiments with a total of 180 male undergraduates. In Exp I, more helping was found for alone and 2-person group Ss who were exposed to a nonambiguous emergency than for similar Ss who were exposed to a highly ambiguous emergency. In Exp 2, there was a tendency for the 2-person Ss to help less than would be expected from the alone Ss' percentage of helping. Ss helped in spite of the potential danger present, although they helped in ways that they perceived to be safe. In addition, Ss who were considered competent were not only more likely to help the victim but did so with less risk to themselves. Results indicate that the characteristics of the emergency situation are important determinants of bystander behavior.

On the impact of Honesty-Humility and a cue of being watched on cheating behavior,"The present contribution examines two factors, as well as their interplay, prominently discussed in the literature on cheating: The basic personality trait of Honesty-Humility from the HEXACO personality model and cues of being watched when given the possibility to cheat. In two studies (Study 1 N = 192, Study 2 N = 957), we applied economically incentivized cheating paradigms (a dice-rolling paradigm and a coin-toss paradigm) and replicated the previously found negative relation between Honesty-Humility and cheating behavior. We further demonstrated that this relation holds beyond the dark personality traits of narcissism, Machiavellianism, psychopathy, and sadism (i.e., the Dark Tetrad). In fact, Honesty-Humility fully absorbed the positive correlations of Dark Tetrad dimensions and cheating. However, we failed to obtain statistically significant results with respect to the other analyzed factor: manipulating being watched by presenting stylized watching eyes when individuals could cheat did not significantly affect cheating behavior. We further found no significant interaction between the personality factors and the presentation of stylized eyes. The findings are discussed with regard to current debates in the fields of cheating and personality as well as when being watched alters behavior. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Pfattheicher, S.; Schindler, S.; Nockur, L.",J.

"Elevation, an emotion for prosocial contagion, is experienced more strongly by those with greater expectations of the cooperativeness of others","A unique emotion, elevation, is thought to underlie prosocial contagion, a process whereby witnessing a prosocial act leads to acting prosocially. Individuals differ in their propensity to experience elevation, and thus their proneness to prosocial contagion, but little is known about the causes of such variation. We introduce an adaptationist model wherein elevation marks immediate circumstances in which generalized prosociality is advantageous, with this evaluation of circumstances hinging in part on prior expectations of others' prosociality. In 15 studies, we add to evidence that elevation can reliably be elicited and mediates prosocial contagion. Importantly, we confirm a novel prediction-generated by our adaptationist account-that an idealistic attitude, which indexes others' expected degree of prosociality, moderates the relationship between exposure to prosocial cues and experiencing elevation. We discuss how our findings inform both basic theorizing in the affective sciences and translational efforts to engineer a more harmonious world, and we offer future research directions to further test and extend our model. © 2019 Sparks et al.

Perceived gaze direction modulates neural processing of prosocial decision making,"Gaze direction is a common social cue implying potential interpersonal interaction. However, little is known about the neural processing of social decision making influenced by perceived gaze direction. Here, we employed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) method to investigate 27 females when they were engaging in an economic exchange game task during which photos of direct or averted eye gaze were shown. We found that, when averted but not direct gaze was presented, prosocial vs. selfish choices were associated with stronger activations in the right superior temporal gyrus (STG) as well as larger functional couplings between right STG and the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). Moreover, stronger activations in right STG was associated with quicker actions for making prosocial choice accompanied with averted gaze. The findings suggest that, when the cue implying social contact is absent, the processing of understanding others’ intention and the relationship between self and others is more involved for making prosocial than selfish decisions. These findings could advance our understanding of the roles of subtle cues in influencing prosocial decision making, as well as shedding lights on deficient social cue processing and functioning among individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). © 2018 Sun, Shao, Wang and Lee.","Sun, D.; Shao, R.; Wang, Z.; Lee, T.M.C.",Front.

"Cycle Thieves, We Are Watching You': Impact of a Simple Signage Intervention against Bicycle Theft","Background: Bicycle theft is a serious problem in many countries, and there is a lack of evidence concerning effective prevention strategies. Displaying images of 'watching eyes' has been shown to make people behave in more socially desirable ways in a number of settings, but it is not yet clear if this effect can be exploited for purposes of crime prevention. We report the results of a simple intervention on a university campus where signs featuring watching eyes and a related verbal message were displayed above bicycle racks. Methodology and Principal Findings: We installed durable signs at three locations which had experienced high levels of bicycle theft, and used the rest of the university campus as a control location. Reported thefts were monitored for 12 months before and after the intervention. Bicycle thefts decreased by 62% at the experimental locations, but increased by 65% in the control locations, suggesting that the signs were effective, but displaced offending to locations with no signs. The Odds Ratio for the effect of the intervention was 4.28 (95% confidence interval 2.04-8.98), a large effect compared to other place-based crime prevention interventions. Conclusions and Significance: The effectiveness of this extremely cheap and simple intervention suggests that there can be considerable crime-reduction benefits to engaging the psychology of surveillance, even in the absence of surveillance itself. Simple interventions for high-crime locations based on this principle should be considered as an adjunct to other measures, although a possible negative consequence is displacement of offending. © 2012 Nettle et al.","Nettle, D.; Nott, K.; Bateson, M.",PLoS ONE,1255
Game theory and human evolution: A critique of some recent interpretations of experimental games,"Economists and psychologists have been testing Nash equilibrium predictions of game theory models of human behavior. In many instances, humans do not conform to the predictions. These results are of great interest to biologists because they also raise questions about well-known ESS models of cooperation. Cooperation in certain one-shot, anonymous interactions, and a willingness to punish others at a net cost to oneself are some of the most intriguing deviations from standard theory. One proposed explanation for these results that is receiving increasing attention invokes the cultural group selection of 'other regarding' social norms. We critically review this explanation. We conclude that experimental results reveal limits in two implicit models of cognitive structure commonly employed by economists and evolutionary biologists. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Systematic review and meta-analysis of psychomotor effects of mobile phone electromagnetic fields,"OBJECTIVES: Over the past 10 years there has been increasing concern about the possible behavioural effects of mobile phone use. This systematic review and meta-analysis focuses on studies published since 1999 on the human cognitive and performance effects of mobile phone-related electromagnetic fields (EMF). METHODS: PubMed, Biomed, Medline, Biological Sciences, PsychInfo, PsycARTICLES, Environmental Sciences and Pollution Management, Neurosciences Abstracts and Web of Science professional databases were searched and 24 studies selected for meta-analysis. Each study had to have at least one psychomotor measurement result as a main outcome. Data were analysed using standardised mean difference (SMD) as the effect size measure. Results Only three tasks (2-back, 3-back and simple reaction time (SRT)) displayed significant heterogeneity, but after studies with extreme SMD were excluded using sensitivity analysis, the statistical significance disappeared (χ(2)(7)=1.63, p=0.20; χ(2)(6)=1.00, p=0.32; χ(2)(10)=14.04, p=0.17, respectively). Following sensitivity analysis, the effect of sponsorship and publication bias were assessed. Meta-regression indicated a significant effect (b1/40.12, p<0.05) only for the 2-back task with mixed funding (industry and public/charity). Funnel plot inspection revealed a significant publication bias only for two cognitive tasks: SRT (Begg's rank correlation r=0.443; Egger's test b=-0.652) and the subtraction task (Egger's test b=-0.687). CONCLUSIONS: Mobile phone-like EMF do not seem to induce cognitive and psychomotor effects. Nonetheless, the existence of sponsorship and publication biases should encourage WHO intervention to develop official research standards and guidelines. In addition, future research should address critical and neglected issues such as investigation of repeated, intensive and chronic exposures, especially in highly sensitive populations such as children.","Valentini, Elia; Ferrara, Michele; Presaghi, Fabio; De Gennaro, Luigi; Curcio, Giuseppe",Occup.

"Altruism, costly signaling, and withholding information in a sport charity campaign","Are more generous altruists more likely to signal their altruism? According to the theory of costly signaling, altruists signal their altruism in order to enhance their reputations; this theory predicts that above-average altruists will be most likely to signal their altruism. However, previous empirical research has found that average altruists are more likely to signal their altruism than above- and below-average altruists, suggesting adherence to an egalitarian norm. Studies of real-life of altruism, reputation management, and signaling are rare. Here, we examined a sport charity database to look at the behavior of donors and fundraising runners. We observed that average donors are the most likely to publish both their names and the amount, whereas below-average donors are more likely to publish only their name (and hide the amount), and extremely generous donors are more likely to publish only the amount (and hide their name) than less generous donors. We also found that runners who targeted a higher sum or a longer distance garnered larger sums through larger individual donations. These results support egalitarian theories of signaling and show that humans actively manipulate the information about their altruistic act to maximize their reputation. © 2019 The Author(s).","Mokos, J.; Scheuring, I.",Evolution.

The moderators and mediators of door-in-the-face requests: Is it a negotiation or a helping experience?,"The Door-in-the-Face (DITF) compliance-gaining tactic occurs when a large request, expected to be rejected, is followed by a more reasonable request that is granted. The mechanisms underlying the DITF strategy remain unclear. Researchers have posed different explanations for the effectiveness of DITF, including the reciprocal concessions and the social responsibility models. These theoretical rationales for DITF were tested in a 3 (request type: initial request only, DITF sequence, small request only)2 (initial request size: moderate, large)2 (solicitor familiarity: friend, stranger) between-participants experiment. Findings from the compliance data are mostly consistent with the reciprocal concessions model; but, findings from the cognitive and affective data were mixed. It appears that DITF messages are perceived as a helping situation for friends, but not for strangers. Strangers view request messages of all sizes to be a negotiation, but friends see these requests as a negotiation only when the initial request is large.","Turner, M.M.; Tamborini, R.; Limon, M.S.; Zuckerman-Hyman, C.",Commun.

Crowding-out or crowding-in: The dynamics of different revenue streams,"An important question in public economics is to what extent changes in government funding lead to changes in private donations. In this chapter we identify and summarize four theoretical perspectives answering this question: the micro-economic, institutional-political, institutional signaling, and organizational perspective. Reviewing the empirical support for each perspective, we find that none of the perspectives sufficiently explains the dispersed empirical evidence for the relationship between government financial support and individual philanthropic donations. We argue that the context in which nonprofit organizations operate is a relevant but often overlooked factor that influences how government support affects philanthropic giving. Research in this area should adopt a dynamic perspective, taking into account the dynamics of different nonprofit revenue streams (from governments, businesses, foundations, and households) as well as contextual level factors like the subsector of the nonprofit sector and country characteristics. © 2020 Taylor & Francis.","de Wit, A.; Bekkers, R.; Wiepking, P.",Financing Nonprofit Organizations,1260
Social image or social Norm?: Re-examining the audience effect in dictator game Experiments,"Andreoni and Bernheim (2009) consider a variant of the dictator game in which a recipient does not know whether an allocation decision was made by a dictator or by an exogenous force, called “nature”. They find that as the likelihood of nature's intervention increased, more subjects mimicked the nature's move. We replicate their experiment, and examine a new treatment in which a recipient is always informed about whether a dictator or nature made a decision. We find that (i) many dictators’ decisions were affected by nature's intervention even when the recipient was informed of whether the dictator or nature had made the decision, which suggests that the intervention altered not only the incentive to signal one's willingness to comply with the social norm but also the social norm itself (i.e., the perception of an appropriate action), but (ii) still dictators’ behavior under the two treatments differed significantly, which suggests that the audience effect also matters greatly. © 2019","Kim, C.; Kim, S.-H.",J.

"Social game theory: Preferences, perceptions, and choices","Building on classic game theory, psychologists have explored the effects of social preferences and expectations on strategic behaviour. Ordinary social perceivers are sensitive to additional contextual factors not addressed by game theory and its recent psychological extensions. We review the results of a research programme exploring how observers judge “players” (i.e., individuals making strategic decisions in social dilemmas) on the dimensions of competence and morality. We explore social perception in several well-known dilemmas, including the prisoner’s dilemma, the volunteer’s dilemma, and the trust dilemma. We also introduce a novel self-presentational dilemma. In research conducted over a decade and a half, we have found that judgements of competence are sensitive to both players’ choices and the dilemma’s (expected and actual) outcomes. In contrast, judgements of morality respond strongly to players’ behaviour and little else. We discuss how these social-perceptual patterns might affect expectations, preferences, and strategic choices. © 2020, © 2020 European Association of Social Psychology.","Krueger, J.I.; Heck, P.R.; Evans, A.M.; DiDonato, T.E.",Eur.

"Effect of dietary fiber intake on blood pressure: a meta-analysis of randomized, controlled clinical trials","OBJECTIVE: We conducted a meta-analysis of 25 randomized controlled trials published in English-language journals before February 2004, to assess the effect of dietary fiber intake on blood pressure (BP). DESIGN: Using a standardized protocol, information on study design, sample size, participant characteristics, duration of follow-up and change in mean BP, was abstracted. The data from each study were pooled using a random effects model to provide an overall estimate of dietary fiber intake on BP. INTERVENTION: Dietary fiber intake was the only significant intervention difference between the active and control groups. RESULTS: Overall, dietary fiber intake was associated with a significant -1.65 mmHg [95% confidence interval (CI), -2.70 to -0.61] reduction in diastolic BP (DBP) and a non-significant -1.15 mmHg (95% CI, -2.68 to 0.39) reduction in systolic BP (SBP). A significant reduction in both SBP and DBP was observed in trials conducted among patients with hypertension (SBP -5.95 mmHg, 95% CI, -9.50 to -2.40; DBP -4.20 mmHg, 95% CI, -6.55 to -1.85) and in trials with a duration of intervention > or = 8 weeks (SBP -3.12 mmHg, 95% CI, -5.68 to -0.56; DBP -2.57 mmHg, 95% CI, -4.01 to -1.14). CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that increased intake of dietary fiber may reduce BP in patients with hypertension and suggests a smaller, non-conclusive, reduction in normotensives. An intervention period of at least 8 weeks may be necessary to achieve the maximum reduction in BP. Our findings warrant conduct of additional clinical trials with a larger sample size and longer period of intervention to examine the effect of dietary fiber intake on BP.","Whelton, Seamus P; Hyre, Amanda D; Pedersen, Bonnie; Yi, Yeonjoo; Whelton, Paul K; He, Jiang",J.

A field study on watching eyes and hand hygiene compliance in a public restroom,"Humans modify their behavior in a socially desirable way when being watched by others. We applied this basic idea to hand hygiene compliance, a behavior that is crucial for preventing germ transmission and successive infections in many settings. Building on the assumption that hand hygiene behavior is socially desirable, we assume that individuals show stronger hand hygiene compliance when being watched. In a field study in a women's public restroom (N = 354), we exposed individuals to a message advising that hand-washing protects against the spread of pathogens. In the experimental condition, stylized human watching eyes were presented above the message. In the control condition, three stars were presented. Analysis revealed a significantly higher percentage of hand hygiene compliance in the watching eyes condition (83.3%) compared to the control condition (71.9%; odds ratio: 1.95, p =.01).

Effects of minimal social cues on trust in the investment game,"In anonymous game tasks, individuals’ prosocial behaviour was shown to increase when those individuals were provided with social cues from a third party or bystander. It has been suggested that those social cues can be presented using a configuration suggestive of a face with ‘watching eyes’. This led us to question whether it was possible to provide the watching-eyes configuration with even weaker facial information, such as a simple dot pattern. By using a minimal social cue paradigm, such as the one described above, the present research found that individuals’ trust toward the trustee increased when they detected the watching-eyes dot pattern as a source of social cues in two settings: a hypothetical investment game for both college students (Study 1) and customs officers (Study 2); and an actual investment game for college students (Study 3). © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd, Asian Association of Social Psychology and Beijing Normal University","Xin, Z.; Liu, Y.; Yang, Z.; Zhang, H.",Asian J.

What Sustainable Development Goals Do Social Innovations Address? A Systematic Review and Content Analysis of Social Innovation Literature,"Interest in social innovations (SIs) from both the academic and the policy side is growing. Nonetheless, we still know little about which sustainable development goals (SDGs) SIs already address. Furthermore, only little is known about who the innovators developing and implementing SIs are. In this paper, we aim to bring more clarity and structure to the field of SIs. Firstly, a systematic literature review was conducted, before a content analysis was used to analyze the definitions used with regard to similarities. Secondly, all case studies described in the reviewed articles were then further systematically analyzed in order to identify the social or environmental problems addressed and the innovators involved. For the purpose of classifying the diverse types of problems, we used the globally known and broadly accepted 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs). Results showed that most SI case studies deal with an improvement of health and well-being. Furthermore, our study illustrates that there is a pronounced difference in the focus of SIs between developing and developed countries. Concerning the innovators, our results indicate that five types of innovators are fundamentally involved in developing and implementing SIs: social entrepreneurs, NGOs and non-profits, public institutions, civil society, firms, and social enterprises. Our definition analysis as well as the identification and classification of the innovators and addressed social needs bring much-needed clarity and structure to the field. However, our systematic review shows that SI is still in its infancy and it will be interesting to see where the field will head. © 2018 by the authors.","Eichler, Georg M; Schwarz, Erich J",Sustainability (Switzerland),1271
Do sympathy biases induce charitable giving? The effects of advertising content,"We randomize advertising content motivated by the psychology literature on sympathy generation and framing effects in mailings to about 185,000 prospective new donors in India. We find a significant impact on the number of donors and amounts donated consistent with sympathy biases such as the “identifiable victim,” “in-group,” and “reference dependence.” A monthly reframing of the ask amount increases donors and the amount donated relative to daily reframing. A second field experiment targeted to past donors, finds that the effect of sympathy bias on giving is smaller in percentage terms but statistically and economically highly significant in terms of the magnitude of additional dollars raised. Methodologically, the paper complements the work of behavioral scholars by adopting an empirical researchers’ lens of measuring relative effect sizes and economic relevance of multiple behavioral theoretical constructs in the sympathy bias and charity domain within one field setting. Beyond the benefit of conceptual replications, the effect sizes provide guidance to managers on which behavioral theories are most managerially and economically relevant when developing advertising content. © 2016 INFORMS.","Sudhir, K.; Roy, S.; Cherian, M.",Mark.

Neural correlates of theory-of-mind reasoning: An event-related potential study,"Everyday understanding of human behavior rests on having a theory of mind - the ability to relate people's actions to underlying mental states such as beliefs and desires. It has been suggested that an impaired theory of mind may lie at the heart of psychological disorders that are characterized by deficits in social understanding, such as autism. In this study, we employed the event-related potential methodology to index the activity of neural systems that are engaged during theory-of-mind reasoning in adults. Specifically, neural activity elicited by tasks that required thinking about mental as compared with nonmental representations (i.e., beliefs vs. photographs) was characterized by a focally enhanced positivity over left frontal areas, which was diminished over left parietal areas. These findings provide an important perspective on both children's theory-of-mind development and the neurobiology of disorders in which theory of mind seems to be impaired.","Sabbagh, M.A.; Taylor, M.",Psychol.

Influences of a Luck Game on Offers in Ultimatum and Dictator Games: Is There a Mediation of Emotions?,"The ultimatum (UG) and dictator (DG) games are two tasks where a sum of money has to be divided between two players: a proposer and a receiver. Following the rational choice theory, proposers should offer the minimum in the UG and nothing in the DG, due to the presence/absence of the receivers’ bargaining power. The fact that people generally make non-negligible offers in both games has suggested divergent explicative hypotheses and has generated extensive research to examine exogenous and endogenous factors underlying such decisions. Among the contextual factors affecting the proposers’ offers, the sense of entitlement or of ownership has been shown to reduce offers significantly. A frequent way to induce the sense of entitlement/ownership has been to assign the role of proposer to the player who apparently has better scored in skill tasks executed before the UG or DG or has more contributed, through a previous luck game, to the amount to be shared. Such manipulations, however, could produce a possible overlapping between “ownership” and “merit,” that in this study we aimed to disentangle. We manipulated the participants’ initial endowment through a luck game, by increasing, decreasing or leaving it unchanged, to investigate whether winnings or losses by chance influenced offers in UG and DG in similar or different ways depending on their respective features. All participants played as proposers but this role was apparently random and disconnected from the outcomes of the luck game. Furthermore, we investigated whether the putative effect of experimental manipulation was mediated by the changes in emotions elicited by the luck game and/or by the emotions and beliefs related to decision-making. We used a non-economic version of the games, in which tokens were divided instead of money. In the study, 300 unpaid undergraduates (M = 152) from different degree programs, aged between 18 and 42 years, participated. The results revealed that the effect of outcome manipulation on offers was moderated by the specific structure of the UG and DG. Instead, emotional reactions barely mediated the effect of the experimental manipulation, suggesting that their role in those decisions is less relevant than is assumed in the literature. © Copyright © 2020 Matarazzo, Pizzini and Greco.","Matarazzo, O.; Pizzini, B.; Greco, C.",Front.

Construal-Level Theory of Psychological Distance,"People are capable of thinking about the future, the past, remote locations, another person's perspective, and counterfactual alternatives. Without denying the uniqueness of each process, it is proposed that they constitute different forms of traversing psychological distance. Psychological distance is egocentric: Its reference point is the self in the here and now, and the different ways in which an object might be removed from that point-in time, in space, in social distance, and in hypotheticality-constitute different distance dimensions. Transcending the self in the here and now entails mental construal, and the farther removed an object is from direct experience, the higher (more abstract) the level of construal of that object. Supporting this analysis, research shows (a) that the various distances are cognitively related to each other, (b) that they similarly influence and are influenced by level of mental construal, and (c) that they similarly affect prediction, preference, and action. © 2010 American Psychological Association.","Trope, Y.; Liberman, N.",Psychol.

Interventions to Increase Blood Donation among Ethnic/Racial Minorities: A Systematic Review,"Ethnic/racial minorities are under-represented in blood donor populations in most developed countries. This is of particular concern where minorities differ from a country's majority population in terms of blood or tissue typing, especially where type matching is required for effective management of rare disorders such as sickle-cell disease that require multiple transfusions. This systematic review assessed the effectiveness of interventions to increase blood donation among ethnic/racial minority populations in developed countries. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and ProQuest on 20 March 2017 with no date restrictions and supplemented this with searches on Google Scholar, blood collection agency websites, reference lists of included studies, and a forward search of citations of included studies. We included intervention studies designed to increase recruitment and/or retention of adult, ethnic/racial minority blood donors in developed countries. The review identified eight studies reported in nine publications. Six were conducted in the USA with African Americans. Four studies reported on multifaceted, community-based interventions; three reported on one-off information and educational video interventions, presented face-to-face, or delivered via post or e-mail. The level of evidence for efficacy was low, and the majority of studies were assessed as having some risk of bias related to one or more methodological issues. All eight studies reported positive outcomes in blood donation and/or intention to donate. Seven trials found that the intervention increased presentation for donation, and three found an increase in the percentage of new donors from the ethnic minority targeted. The review findings demonstrate that it is possible to design and implement effective interventions to motivate individuals from ethnic/racial minority groups to donate blood. One-off interventions may be as effective as multifaceted, community-based interventions. There was insufficient evidence to recommend particular interventions, and future research should empirically assess alternative interventions using robust study designs.","Makin, Jennifer K; Francis, Kate L; Polonsky, Michael J; Renzaho, Andre M N",J.

Experience with anonymous interactions reduces intuitive cooperation,"The Social Heuristics Hypothesis claims that cooperation is intuitive because it is positively reinforced in everyday life, where behaviour typically has reputational consequences 1,2 . Consequently, participants will cooperate in anonymous laboratory settings unless they either reflect on the one-shot nature of the interaction or learn through experience with such settings that cooperation does not promote self-interest. Experiments reveal that cognitive-processing manipulations (which increase reliance on either intuition or deliberation) indeed affect cooperation 3 , but may also introduce confounds 4,5 . Here, we elide the interpretation issues created by between-subjects designs in showing that people are less cooperative over time in laboratory paradigms in which cooperation cannot promote self-interest, but are just as cooperative over time in paradigms that have the potential to promote self-interest. Contrary to previous findings 6,7 , we find that cooperation is equally intuitive for men and women: unilateral giving did not differ across gender at the first study session, and decreased equally for both genders across sessions. © 2018, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","McAuliffe, W.H.B.; Forster, D.E.; Pedersen, E.J.; McCullough, M.E.",Nat.

Psychological perception by students of prosocial media,"Introduction. In the current situation of socio-economic development, the process of digitalization of a society has a significant impact on the socialization of an individual. Digital media resources can set ideal personality patterns and norms of behavior, forming value orientations and prosocial behavior of youth. Purpose. To analyze and evaluate the influence of prosocial media on the psychological perception of students, expressed in prosocial thinking, emotional reactions and prosocial intentions. Study participants. The sample consisted of 210 Moscow students (28% of males, 72% of females) aged 18 to 26 (M = 21). Methodical tools. The subjects were asked to watch sequentially seven videos (media resources) of prosocial content posted on the YouTube video hosting. The influence of prosocial media on nonsocial thinking, emotional reactions, and prosocial intentions was evaluated using the specially designed questionnaire “Media Resource Analysis”. The obtained empirical data were comprehended and processed using content analysis, quantitative analysis methods (descriptive statistics, percentage analysis, Friedman's two-way rank analysis of variance for related samples, Mann-Whitney test, Pearson correlation analysis). Results and scientific novelty. The study showed that prosocial media cause various emotional reactions (χ2 = 84.92; p&lt;0.001) and prosocial intentions (χ2 = 76,86; p&lt;0,001). In terms of actualization of prosocial intentions and thinking in students, news stories about specific events turned out to be more effective. The experience of volunteering does not affect the impact of prosocial media on prosocial thinking and prosocial intentions, and positive emotions compared to negative ones lead to more prosocial thinking and prosocial behavior, encouraging the viewer to contribute to helping those in need (0.211 ≤ r ≤ 0.588; p ≤ 0.05). Practical significance. The consideration of the study results and the identified relationships makes it possible to use them for promotion of the propagation of prosocial behavior among young people, dissemination of the information about volunteering in the media and through social advertising, and contribution to the creation of a positive image of a charity participant in society through the media. Numerous communities covering the activities of charitable foundations and organizations and calling for the provision of assistance of various kind can use the identified relationships on social networks to popularize the values of mutual assistance, kindness, mercy, citizenship, and the appeal of students to social activity. © 2020 LLC Ecological Help.

Cooperators benefit through reputation-based partner choice in economic games,"Explaining unconditional cooperation, such as donations to charities or contributions to public goods, continues to present a problem. One possibility is that cooperation can pay through developing a reputation that makes one more likely to be chosen for a profitable cooperative partnership, a process termed competitive altruism (CA) or reputation-based partner choice. Here, we show, to our knowledge, for the first time, that investing in a cooperative reputation can bring net benefits through access to more cooperative partners. ParticiPants played a public goods game (PGG) followed by an opportunity to select a partner for a second cooperative game. We found that those who gave more in the PGG were more often selected as desired partners and received more in the paired cooperative game. Reputational competition was even stronger when it was possible for particiPants to receive a higher payoff from partner choice. The benefits of being selected by a more cooperative partner outweighed the costs of cooperation in the reputation building phase. CA therefore provides an alternative to indirect reciprocity as an explanation for reputation-building behaviour. Furthermore, while indirect reciprocity depends upon individuals giving preference to those of good standing, CA can explain unconditional cooperation. © 2010 The Royal Society.","Sylwester, K.; Roberts, G.",Biol.

"Intuition, deliberation, and the evolution of cooperation","Humans often cooperate with strangers, despite the costs involved. A long tradition of theoretical modeling has sought ultimate evolutionary explanations for this seemingly altruistic behavior. More recently, an entirely separate body of experimental work has begun to investigate cooperation's proximate cognitive underpinnings using a dualprocess framework: Is deliberative self-control necessary to reign in selfish impulses, or does self-interested deliberation restrain an intuitive desire to cooperate? Integrating these ultimate and proximate approaches, we introduce dual-process cognition into a formal gametheoretic model of the evolution of cooperation. Agents play prisoner's dilemma games, some of which are one-shot and others of which involve reciprocity. They can either respond by using a generalized intuition, which is not sensitive to whether the game is oneshot or reciprocal, or pay a (stochastically varying) cost to deliberate and tailor their strategy to the type of game they are facing. We find that, depending on the level of reciprocity and assortment, selection favors one of two strategies: intuitive defectors who never deliberate, or dual-process agents who intuitively cooperate but sometimes use deliberation to defect in one-shot games. Critically, selection never favors agents who use deliberation to override selfish impulses: Deliberation only serves to undermine cooperation with strangers. Thus, by introducing a formal theoretical framework for exploring cooperation through a dual-process lens, we provide a clear answer regarding the role of deliberation in cooperation based on evolutionary modeling, help to organize a growing body of sometimesconflicting empirical results, and shed light on the nature of human cognition and social decision making.","Bear, A.; Rand, D.G.",Proc.

Replicating and extending the effects of auditory religious cues on dishonest behavior,"Although scientists agree that replications are critical to the debate on the validity of religious priming research, religious priming replications are scarce. This paper attempts to replicate and extend previously observed effects of religious priming on ethical behavior. We test the effect of religious instrumental music on individuals' ethical behavior with university participants (N = 408) in the Czech Republic, Japan, and the US. Participants were randomly assigned to listen to one of three musical tracks (religious, secular, or white noise) or to no music (control) for the duration of a decision-making game. Participants were asked to indicate which side of a vertically-bisected computer screen contained more dots and, in every trial, indicating that the right side of the screen had more dots earned participants the most money (irrespective of the number of dots). Therefore, participants were able to report dishonestly to earn more money. In agreement with previous research, we did not observe any main effects of condition. However, we were unable to replicate a moderating effect of selfreported religiosity on the effects of religious music on ethical behavior. Nevertheless, further analyses revealed moderating effects for ritual participation and declared religious affiliation congruent with the musical prime. That is, participants affiliated with a religious organization and taking part in rituals cheated significantly less than their peers when listening to religious music. We also observed significant differences in cheating behavior across samples. On average, US participants cheated the most and Czech participants cheated the least. We conclude that normative conduct is, in part, learned through active membership in religious communities and our findings provide further support for religious music as a subtle, moral cue. © 2020 Nichols et al.","Nichols, A.D.; Lang, M.; Kavanagh, C.; Kundt, R.; Yamada, J.; Ariely, D.; Mitkidis, P.",PLoS ONE,1286
Worlds of welfare and attitudes to redistribution: A comparison of eight Western nations,"In this paper attitudes to redistribution in eight Western nations are analysed, using data from the International Social Survey Program (ISSP). The paper begins with a discussion of various 'regime types' as presented by Esping-Andersen and Castles and Mitchell, among others. Countries are then chosen to represent four 'twin pairs' of countries, approximating four 'worlds of welfare capitalism': the social democratic (Sweden/Norway), the conservative (Germany/Austria), the liberal (US/ Canada), and the radical (Australia/New Zealand). The empirical analysis assesses whether attitudes to redistribution and income differences are structured in the way suggested by the discussion of different cleavage structures in various regime types. It is concluded that while the level of attitudes regarding redistribution and income differences clearly is affected by regime type, group patterns are very similar between all the countries.","Svallfors, S.",Eur.

Pathological video-game use among youth ages 8 to 18: A national study: Research article,"Researchers have studied whether some youth are ""addicted"" to video games, but previous studies have been based on regional convenience samples. Using a national sample, this study gathered information about video-gaming habits and parental involvement in gaming, to determine the percentage of youth who meet clinical-style criteria for pathological gaming. A Harris poll surveyed a randomly selected sample of 1,178 American youth ages 8 to 18. About 8% of video-game players in this sample exhibited pathological patterns of play. Several indicators documented convergent and divergent validity of the results: Pathological gamers spent twice as much time playing as nonpathological gamers and received poorer grades in school; pathological gaming also showed comorbidity with attention problems. Pathological status significantly predicted poorer school performance even after controlling for sex, age, and weekly amount of video-game play.

"Lessons Learned, Challenges, and Opportunities: The US Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program","In 1996, the U.S. Congress passed the Food Quality Protection Act and amended the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) requiring the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to implement a screening program to investigate the potential of pesticide chemicals and drinking water contaminants to adversely affect endocrine pathways. Consequently, the EPA launched the Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program (EDSP) to develop and validate estrogen, androgen, and thyroid (EAT) pathway screening assays and to produce standardized and harmonized test guidelines for regulatory application. In 2009, the EPA issued the first set of test orders for EDSP screening and a total of 50 pesticide actives and 2 inert ingredients have been evaluated using the battery of EDSP Tier 1 screening assays (i.e., five in vitro assays and six in vivo assays). To provide a framework for retrospective analysis of the data generated and to collect the insight of multiple stakeholders involved in the testing, more than 240 scientists from government, industry, academia, and non-profit organizations recently participated in a workshop titled ``Lessons Learned, Challenges, Opportunities: The U.S. Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program.'' The workshop focused on the science and experience to date and was organized into three focal sessions: (a) Performance of the EDSP Tier 1 Screening Assays for Estrogen, Androgen, and Thyroid Pathways; (b) Practical Applications of Tier 1 Data; and (c) Indications and Opportunities for Future Endocrine Testing. A number of key findings and recommendations related to future EDSP evaluations emanated from the collective sessions.","Juberg, Daland R; Borghoff, Susan J; Becker, Richard A; Casey, Warren; Hartung, Thomas; Holsapple, Michael P; Marty, M Sue; Mihaich, Ellen M; Van der Kraak, Glen; Wade, Michael G; Willett, Catherine E; Andersen, Melvin E; Borgert, Christopher J; Coady, Katherine K; Dourson, Michael L; Fowle, John R, III; Gray, L Earl; Lamb, James C; Ortego, Lisa S; Schug, Thaddeus T; Toole, Colleen M; Zorrilla, Leah M; Kroner, Oliver L; Patterson, Jacqueline; Rinckel, Lori A; Jones, Brett R",ALTEX-ALTERNATIVES TO ANIMAL EXPERIMENTATION,1290

"Reputation, Gossip, and Human Cooperation","Why do people cooperate? We address this classic question by analyzing and discussing the role of reputation: people cooperate to maintain a positive reputation in their social environment. Reputation is a key element fueling a system of indirect reciprocity, where cooperators establish a good reputation and are thus more likely to receive future benefits from third parties. The tendencies to monitor, spread, and manage each other's reputation help explain the abundance of human cooperation with unrelated strangers. We review research on the phenomenon of reputation-based cooperation in the domains of how people manage their reputation in response to varying cues of reputation, when reputation can promote cooperation, and individual differences in reputation management. We also propose three directions for future research: group stability and reputation-based cooperation, solutions to cope with noise and biased reputation, and the relative efficiency of positive versus negative reputation systems. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Wu, J.; Balliet, D.; Van Lange, P.A.M.",Soc.

On expectations and the monetary stakes in ultimatum games,"In an ultimatum game, player 1 makes an offer of $X from a total of $M to player 2. If player 2 accepts the offer, then player 1 is paid $(M-X) and player 2 receives $X; if player 2 rejects the offer, each gets zero. In the ultimatum game experiments reported in the literature, M is typically not more than $10 (see Forsythe, Horowitz, Savin and Sefton, 1994, hereafter FHSS; Hoffman, McCabe, Shachat and Smith, 1994, hereafter HMSS, and the literature cited therein). We report new results for 50 bargaining pairs in which M = $100, and compare them with previous outcomes from 48 pairs with M = $10. The need for an examination of the effect of increased stakes on ultimatum bargaining is suggested by a literature survey of the effect of varying the stakes in a wide variety of decision making and market experiments over the last 33 years (Smith and Walker, 1993b). Many cases were found in which the predictions of theory were improved when the monetary rewards were increased. There were also cases in which the level of monetary rewards had no effect on the results. Consequently, it is necessary to examine the stakes question on a case by case basis. The previously reported effect of instructional changes, which define different institutional contexts, on ultimatum game outcomes, and the effect of stakes reported here, suggest a game formulation that explains changes in the behavior of both players as a result of changes in the instructional treatments. We formulate such a model and indicate how it might be further tested.","Hoffman, E.; McCabe, K.A.; Smith, V.L.",Int. J. Game Theory,1293

Spending money on others promotes happiness,"Although much research has examined the effect of income on happiness, we suggest that how people spend their money may be at least as important as how much money they earn. Specifically, we hypothesized that spending money on other people may have a more positive impact on happiness than spending money on oneself. Providing converging evidence for this hypothesis, we found that spending more of one's income on others predicted greater happiness both cross-sectionally (in a nationally representative survey study) and longitudinally (in a field study of windfall spending). Finally, participants who were randomly assigned to spend money on others experienced greater happiness than those assigned to spend money on themselves.","Dunn, E.W.; Aknin, L.B.; Norton, M.I.",Science,1296
Sensitization-habituation may occur during operant conditioning,"Operant response rates often change within experimental sessions, sometimes increasing and then decreasing. The authors attribute these changes to sensitization and habituation to aspects of the experimental situation presented repeatedly (e.g., reinforcers) or for a prolonged time (e.g., the experimental enclosure). They describe several empirical similarities between sensitization-habituation and within-session changes in operant responding. They argue that many alternative explanations for within-session changes in operant responding can be dismissed. They also examine some implications of linking the literatures on habituation and operant responding. Because responding follows a similar pattern in several other cases (e.g., human vigilance, classical conditioning, and unconditioned responding), 2 relatively simple processes may be responsible for the temporal patterning of behavior in a wide variety of situations.

The minds of gods: A comparative study of supernatural agency,"The present work is the first study to systematically compare the minds of gods by examining some of the intuitive processes that guide how people reason about them. By examining the Christian god and the spirit-masters of the Tyva Republic, it first confirms that the consensus view of the Christian god?s mind is one of omniscience with acute concern for interpersonal social behavior (i.e., moral behaviors) and that Tyvan spirit-masters are not as readily attributed with knowledge or concern of moral information. Then, it reports evidence of a moralization bias of gods? minds; American Christians who believe that God is omniscient rate God as more knowledgeable of moral behaviors than nonmoral information. Additionally, Tyvans who do not readily report pro- or antisocial behavior among the things that spirit-masters care about will nevertheless rate spirit-masters? knowledge and concern of moral information higher than nonmoral information. However, this knowledge is distributed spatially; the farther away from spirits? place of governance a moral behavior takes place, the less they know and care about it. Finally, the wider the breadth of knowledge Tyvans attribute to spirit-masters, the more they attribute moral concern for behaviors that transpire beyond their jurisdiction. These results further demonstrate that there is a significant gulf between expressed beliefs and intuitive religious cognition and provides evidence for a moralization bias of gods? minds. © 2013 Elsevier B.V..","Purzycki, B.G.",Cognition,1298
"Characterising forest owners through their objectives, attributes and management strategies","Changes in forest land use and management arise from the decisions of individual forest owners. To gain a better understanding of forest owner decision-making and its implications for forest land-use change, we develop a forest owner functional typology based on a meta-analysis of quantitative and qualitative information about forest owners and their decision-making strategies across the developed world. From this typology, we develop an index of forest owner sustainability. We find nine broad forest owner functional types: industrial productionist, non-industrial productionist, for-profit recreationist, for-profit multi-objective, non-profit multi-objective, recreationalist, species conservationist, ecosystem conservationist and passive owner. These owner types align along three gradients representing (1) their economic focus, (2) the intensity of their management practices and (3) the type of goods and services they provide (private vs. public). We also find that multi-objective and conservationist owners generally practise the most sustainable forms of forest management and industrial productionists the least sustainable in terms of triple bottom line sustainability. Supracontinental land owner typologies of this kind can be useful in assisting international policy making and in developing resource management programmes. We suggest that future studies should investigate forest owner typologies in the developing world, forest owner information-sharing networks, and the ways in which forest owners learn and adapt to environmental change. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Blanco, Victor; Brown, Calum; Rounsevell, Mark",Eur.

A meta-analysis of price elasticities of transport demand in a general equilibrium framework,"Price elasticities of transport demand are an important tool to assess the impacts of pricing policies. Empirical research on these elasticities leads to a rather wide range of outcomes. There is obviously a need for a more rigorous methodological framework. This paper provides a new integrative approach to the estimation of price elasticities whilst taking into account any combination of characteristics of transport demand found in various empirical studies. To this end, we apply meta-analysis to this set of studies. From the various modelling approaches that underlie these studies we develop an overlapping general equilibrium framework that provides a meta-regression equation relating the price elasticity estimate to the study characteristics. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

A simultaneous model of nonprofit symphony orchestra behavior,"In this paper, we test a six equation simultaneous model of nonprofit symphony orchestra behavior. The model is based on Hansmann's theory of nonprofit behavior in the performing arts. The results show that the most prestigious of the orchestras practise a pricing policy that encourages patrons to make a tax deductible contribution. In this manner, they achieve a pattern of price discrimination that, instead of increasing revenues, reduces revenues. Following conditions suggested by Hansmann, we are also able to draw conclusions about the objectives of nonprofit symphony orchestras. © 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","Luksetich, W.A.; Lange, M.D.",J Cult Econ,1302
Applications of continuous improvement methodologies in the voluntary sector: a systematic literature review,"Despite the vast acceptance of continuous improvement (CI) methodologies in manufacturing and services industries, few organisations have implemented CI in the voluntary sector (VS). This paper presents a systematic review of the literature on CI methodologies in VS. 20 publications on the application of CI methodologies in VS were included drawn from four academic databases (EBSCOHost, Emerald Insight, Web of Science and Scopus). The review was restricted to peer-reviewed English-written academic articles published between 2000 and 2017. The findings revealed that cost reduction, increased customer satisfaction and improved staff empowerment are some of the potential benefits of implementing CI in the VS. Further, the possible challenges include resistance to change, lack of formal processes and the diversity of customers. This review underlines the critical success factors for the adoption of CI methodologies as appropriate leadership and organisational culture and staff engagement. Additionally, the paper identifies emerging trends and research gaps in this area. The findings of the study will enable VS professionals to gain a better understanding of the application of CI methodologies and will allow academics to conduct further research in this area using the identified research gaps. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Jevanesan, T.; Antony, J.; Rodgers, B.; Prashar, A.",Total Qual.

Young Children Are More Generous when Others Are Aware of Their Actions,"Adults frequently employ reputation-enhancing strategies when engaging in prosocial acts, behaving more generously when their actions are likely to be witnessed by others and even more so when the extent of their generosity is made public. This study examined the developmental origins of sensitivity to cues associated with reputationally motivated prosociality by presenting five-year-olds with the option to provide one or four stickers to a familiar peer recipient at no cost to themselves. We systematically manipulated the recipient's knowledge of the actor's choices in two different ways: (1) occluding the recipient's view of both the actor and the allocation options and (2) presenting allocations in opaque containers whose contents were visible only to the actor. Children were consistently generous only when the recipient was fully aware of the donation options; in all cases in which the recipient was not aware of the donation options, children were strikingly ungenerous. These results demonstrate that five-year-olds exhibit ""strategic prosociality,"" behaving differentially generous as a function of the amount of information available to the recipient about their actions. These findings suggest that long before they develop a rich understanding of the social significance of reputation or are conscious of complex strategic reasoning, children behave more generously when the details of their prosocial actions are available to others. © 2012 Leimgruber et al.","Leimgruber, K.L.; Shaw, A.; Santos, L.R.; Olson, K.R.",PLoS ONE,1305

The evolution of distorted beliefs vs. mistaken choices under asymmetric error costs,"Why do people sometimes hold unjustified beliefs and make harmful choices? Three hypotheses include (a) contemporary incentives in which some errors cost more than others, (b) cognitive biases evolved to manage ancestral incentives with variation in error costs and (c) social learning based on choice frequencies. With both modelling and a behavioural experiment, we examined all three mechanisms. The model and experiment support the conclusion that contemporary cost asymmetries affect choices by increasing the rate of cheap errors to reduce the rate of expensive errors. Our model shows that a cognitive bias can distort the evolution of beliefs and in turn behaviour. Unless the bias is strong, however, beliefs often evolve in the correct direction. This suggests limitations on how cognitive biases shape choices, which further indicates that detecting the behavioural consequences of biased cognition may sometimes be challenging. Our experiment used a prime intended to activate a bias called 'hyperactive agency detection', and the prime had no detectable effect on choices. Finally, both the model and experiment show that frequencydependent social learning can generate choice dynamics in which some populations converge on widespread errors, but this outcome hinges on the other two mechanisms being neutral with respect to choice. © 2020 The Author(s).","Efferson, C.; McKay, R.; Fehr, E.",Evolut.

"Culture-gene coevolution, norm-psychology and the emergence of human prosociality","Diverse lines of theoretical and empirical research are converging on the notion that human evolution has been substantially influenced by the interaction of our cultural and genetic inheritance systems. The application of this culture-gene coevolutionary approach to understanding human social psychology has generated novel insights into the cognitive and affective foundations of large-scale cooperation, social norms and ethnicity. This approach hypothesizes a norm-psychology: a suite of psychological adaptations for inferring, encoding in memory, adhering to, enforcing and redressing violations of the shared behavioral standards of one's community. After reviewing the substantial body of formal theory underpinning these predictions, we outline how this account organizes diverse empirical findings in the cognitive sciences and related disciplines. Norm-psychology offers explanatory traction on the evolved psychological mechanisms that underlie cultural evolution, cross-cultural differences and the emergence of norms. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Chudek, M.; Henrich, J.",Trends Cogn.

"Communication, information and support for adults with malignant cerebral glioma: a systematic literature review","Few studies have considered the needs of patients and relatives of patients with malignant cerebral glioma, but the findings so far appear to be similar to those for lung cancer patients. This suggests that the general principles by which cancer patients are cared for should be applied to patients with malignant cerebral glioma. XCM: The review question was defined in terms of the participants and outcomes. The study design and intervention were not pre-specified and the review was not restricted to intervention studies. A range of databases was searched using a variety of search terms. However, the search strategy was restricted to studies published in English, which may have resulted in research being missed. There was no information on how the data were extracted and by how many reviewers; bias may be introduced to the findings if the studies were not selected and data extracted independently by more than one reviewer.All twelve studies identified for inclusion were of an observational design. Hence, the review discussed emerging themes but could provide no evidence of effective interventions. The studies were quality assessed according to quantitative and qualitative criteria. This study highlights the need for trial investigation methods of providing information, communication and support to this patient group. XIM: Practice: The authors stated that the method of communicating a prognosis to patients and relatives should be adapted depending on the coping style of the individual.Research: The authors stated the need for research on educational interventions that assist staff in the delivery of bad news. Research should also focus on the best mix of health professionals to conduct patient follow-up and other possible means of support such as counselling.

Too good to be true: Publication bias in two prominent studies from experimental psychology,"Empirical replication has long been considered the final arbiter of phenomena in science, but replication is undermined when there is evidence for publication bias. Evidence for publication bias in a set of experiments can be found when the observed number of rejections of the null hypothesis exceeds the expected number of rejections. Application of this test reveals evidence of publication bias in two prominent investigations from experimental psychology that have purported to reveal evidence of extrasensory perception and to indicate severe limitations of the scientific method. The presence of publication bias suggests that those investigations cannot be taken as proper scientific studies of such phenomena, because critical data are not available to the field. Publication bias could partly be avoided if experimental psychologists started using Bayesian data analysis techniques. © 2012 Psychonomic Society, Inc.","Francis, G.",Psychonom. Bull. Rev.,1312

Surveillance cues do not enhance altruistic behavior among anonymous strangers in the field,"The degree of altruistic behavior among strangers is an evolutionary puzzle. A prominent explanation is the evolutionary legacy hypothesis according to which an evolved reciprocity-based psychology affects behavior even when reciprocity is impossible, i.e., altruistic behavior in such instances is maladaptive. Empirical support for this explanation comes from laboratory experiments showing that surveillance cues, e.g., photographs of watching eyes, increase altruistic behavior. A competing interpretation for this evidence, however, is that the cues signal the experimenter’s expectations and participants, aware of being monitored, intentionally behave more altruistically to boost their reputation. Here we report the first results from a field experiment on the topic in which participants are unaware they are being monitored and reciprocity is precluded. The experiment investigates the impact of surveillance cues on a textbook example of altruistic behavior—hand hygiene prior to treating a ‘patient’. We find no evidence surveillance cues affect hand hygiene, despite using different measures of hand-hygiene quality and cues that have been previously shown to be effective. We argue that surveillance cues may have an effect only when participants have reasons to believe they are actually monitored. Thus they cannot support claims altruistic behavior between strangers is maladaptive. Copyright: © 2018 Koornneef et al.

Some psychological aspects of reduced consumption behavior: The role of intrinsic satisfaction and competence motivation,"Nine studies (6 previously published by R. De Young and colleagues and 3 unpublished) that included a bank of questionnaire items on intrinsic satisfactions are summarized and analyzed for their relationship to reduced consumption behavior. Dimensional analysis used in each study to examine the structure of the data identified 2 categories of intrinsic satisfaction (labeled frugality and participation) that are particularly well suited to encouraging such behavior. The dimensional structure of a 3rd category, competence motivation, is interpreted in terms of 3 dominant themes (i.e., world view, pro-self, pro-social) in the research literature. Connections between intrinsic satisfactions and the concepts of locus of control and altruism are discussed. Practitioners encouraging reduced consumption behavior may want to explore strategies that emphasize conservation behavior.

Heterogeneity in crowding-out: When are charitable donations responsive to government support?,"When are donations to non-profit organizations responsive to changes in government funding? This article examines relations between government financial support and charitable donations in an innovative mixed-methods design. A unique data set is obtained, matching individual-level survey data from the Giving in the Netherlands Panel Survey with media coverage of government support from LexisNexis and organizational-level information from the Dutch Central Bureau on Fundraising from 2002 to 2014. An interpretative analysis shows the ways in which people are informed about changes in public funding, which is assumed to be a prerequisite for donors to change their donations. Media coverage often does not reflect actual changes in government support. Additionally, regression analyses are deployed to examine how changes in government support and media reports are associated with changes in donations. The results show that responses to public funding are dependent on the non-profit context. Donations in the fields of social services, health, and nature are displaced by government support, while crowding-out does not occur in the field of international development. Even in fields where crowding-out is more likely to occur, the increase in donations does not offset the decrease in public support. The conclusions nuance popular beliefs about the direct consequences that policy changes have for public awareness and participation. © 2016 The Author.","De Wit, A.; Bekkers, R.; Van Groenou, M.B.",Eur.

My Voice Capturing My Attention to Myself: The Effects of Objective Self-Awareness on Japanese People,"Previous research has demonstrated that the presence of a mirror does not influence Japanese people’s self-evaluation and cheating behaviors, which reflects their tendency to habitually think of themselves based on their imagined perspectives of others. The present work extends the evidence by manipulating the presence of the participants’ own voices as well as that of a mirror (Study 1); it explores the effects of another participant’s voice (Study 2). Consistent with previous findings, the presence of a mirror does not influence Japanese participants’ self-esteem, moral values, and cheating behaviors. In contrast, an impact of their own voice was partially found. The exposure to their own voice decreased the participants’ moral value of fairness and discouraged the participants from cheating by drawing additional coins. Furthermore, no effect of other voices was found. Overall, we observed a limited effect of self-focusing stimuli in Japanese participants, although it should be noted that their own voices were relatively effective for capturing self-focused attention. © Copyright © 2020 Narita and Ishii.","Narita, A.; Ishii, K.",Front.

This paper provides an experimental examination of the behavior of tax evasion and voluntary contributions when both publicly and privately provided public goods are present. The experimental evidence suggests that the privately provided public good is a substitute for the publicly provided public good, but the converse does not hold, and that the level of compliance may be underestimated, ceteris paribus, if private contributions are not taken into account.","Hsu, L.-C.",Natl.

Applying the door-in-the-face compliance technique to retailing,"The door-in-the-face (DITF) approach, a sequential compliance technique in which a large request is followed by a more moderate request, has been shown to increase compliance in a variety of non-business situations. The aim of this study is to investigate whether the DITF technique could also be used to increase sales in a retailing context. A field experiment outside an alpine hut was conducted. A total of 375 consumers participated in the experiment. As they passed by the entrance to the mountain hut, they were approached by an experimenter who invited them to buy some home-made cheese. In the experimental groups the DITF technique was used by the salesperson. The results show that the DITF technique can lead to a significant increase in the number of consumers making a purchase. Furthermore, it was found that this compliance technique is even more effective when it is used by a highly credible seller and when the seller points out that the more moderate request constitutes a concession. The large effect of the DITF intervention (the number of consumers making a purchase increased 15 to 40 percentage points over the control group) suggests that this technique could be used successfully in retailing. © 2008, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Ebster, C.; Neumayr, B.",Int.

The Evolutionary Significance of Habituation and Sensitization Across Phylogeny: A Behavioral Homeostasis Model,"The phenomenon of habituation may be interpreted as a process that has evolved for filtering out iterative stimuli of little present relevance. That habituation is seen in aneural as well as neural organisms throughout phylogeny with remarkably similar characteristics suggests that its role is an important one in animal survival. If habituation is to be viewed as a process to filter out iterative stimuli that have no significant consequences, then how is sensitization to be viewed? One way of viewing these two behavioral changes, i.e. habituation and sensitization, is that they are homeostatic processes which optimize an organism's likelihood of detecting and assessing the significance of a stimulus in a new iterative series or a change in it. If one views the level of initial responsiveness to a new stimulus as a function of an organism's threshold just prior to stimulus occurrence, then ""high responders"" (i.e. those who initially react more strongly) are assumed to have a lower threshold for detecting and assessing the significance of this stimulus than are the ""low responders"" (i.e. those who initially react more weakly). Thus, high-responders would initially receive more sensory input and progressively decrease their responsiveness to a non-threatening stimulus (habituation). Likewise, initial low-responders would receive less sensory input followed by a decreased threshold and an increased response to the next stimulus occurrence (sensitization). The level of responsiveness achieved in both habituaters and sensitizers, as an asymptote is approached, is a balance between being too sensitive to an unimportant stimulus (and possibly missing other significant stimuli) and being too insensitive, and missing a change in the relevance of the present stimulus. These response changes can be taken as indices of the organism's mechanisms for achieving an appropriate threshold level to an iterative stimulus in order to accurately assess its present significance and then eventually to asymptote at an optimal stable response level. This approach toward an asymptote is a behavioral homeostatic process that reflects the accumulated significance of the iterative stimulus at each occurrence. The purpose of adding ""behavioral"" to the term ""homeostasis"" is to extend the usual meaning of the concept from primarily internal processes to also include (a) iterative external stimulation, (b) the organism's initial threshold to the initial stimulus as well as (c) the behavior which results from it. Since we are discussing organisms that range from intact, single-celled protozoa to intact mammals, as well as surgically simplified preparations, the terms stimulus, response and behavior will be used broadly. While other investigators have focused on specific cellular mechanisms underlying habituation and sensitization in a given organism, this paper focuses on the adaptive significance of these two behavioral processes viewed across phylogeny.","Eisenstein, E.M.; Eisenstein, D.; Smith, J.C.",Integr.

Citizen participation and the redistribution of public goods,"This study investigates whether citizen participation in public budgeting resulted in increased redistributive outcomes when compared with bureaucratic decision-making. We focused on a specific budget item (i.e., the installation of surveillance cameras for crime prevention) and examined whether participatory budgeting yielded larger budget allocations to low-income neighbourhoods. Results indicate that such participatory budgeting results in larger budget allocations for low-income neighbourhoods when compared with allocations produced by bureaucratic budgeting practices. The results also indicate that budgets allocated through citizen participation may be no more or even less effective for advancing public goals. These findings suggest a potential trade-off between equity and public service effectiveness. Citizen participation improves budget equity, but may be less effective for achieving public goals than bureaucratic decision-making.

Our workhorse is the Yes-No game. Unlike in ultimatum games responders of the Yes-No games do not know the proposal when deciding whether to accept or not. We use two different amounts that can be shared (100€ and 1000€). Unlike in other experiments with the ultimatum game we find a (small) effect of the size of the stakes. In line with findings for the ultimatum game, we find more generosity among women, older participants, and participants who submit their decision via postal mail than via Internet. By comparing our results with other studies (using executives or students), we demonstrate, at least for this type of game, the external validity of lab research. © 2012 The Author(s).","Güth, W.; Kirchkamp, O.",Exp.

Compliance of blood donation apps with mobile OS usability guidelines,"The aim of this paper is to employ the guidelines of Android, iOS, Blackberry and Windows Phone to analyze the usability compliance of free blood donation (BD) apps. An analysis process based on a systematic review protocol is used to select free BD apps. An assessment is conducted using a questionnaire composed of 13 questions concerning the compliance of free BD apps with Android, Blackberry, iOS and Windows Phone usability guidelines. A total of 133 free BD apps have been selected from the 188 BD apps identified. Around 63% of the free BD apps selected have a good compliance with mobile OS usability recommendations. Around 72% of Android, 57% of Windows Phone, 33% of iOS and 33% of Blackberry BD apps have a high usability score. The aspect of BD app behavior should be improved along with some style components: the use of pictures to explain ideas and the adaptation of the app to both horizontal and vertical orientations. Structure patterns should also be used to improve the structure aspect of a BD app. Usability is a quality aspect that should be improved in current BD apps. Our study provides smartphone users with a list of usable free BD apps and BD app developers with recommendations.","Ouhbi, Sofia; Fernández-Alemán, José Luis; Pozo, José Rivera; Bajta, Manal El; Toval, Ambrosio; Idri, Ali",J.

Door-in-the-face and preference for consistency: When the high preference for consistency subjects don't manifest an established influence effect,"The present study was designed to test the preference for consistency (PFC) effects on both the verbal agreement to give blood and the execution of blood donation, in a door-in-theface situation. Undergraduate students (N=204) participated in the study which took form of a 4 {profile of the influence target: high PFC versus low PFC versus 2 groups without measure of PFC) X 2 (request tactic: Presentation of a large request and then, of the critical request versus presentation of the critical request exclusively) between-subjects design. As expected, results revealed that the door-in-the-face effect only occurs among low-PFC subjects: they are more likely to agree to give their blood and make this donation in the largethen- critical request condition than in the critical-request-only condition. The processes underlying the effectiveness of preference for consistency in the door-in-the-face situation are discussed with reference to the effects of this variable in the foot-in-the-door situation and in the induced-compliance situation.","Sénémeaud, C.; Somat, A.; Terrier, L.; Noël, Y.",Annee Psychol.,1331
Punishment on the frontlines of public service delivery: Client ethnicity and caseworker sanctioning decisions in a Scandinavian welfare state,"Many public welfare programs give public employees discretionary authority to dispense sanctions when clients do not follow or comply with the policies and procedures required for receiving welfare benefits.Yet research also shows that public employees' use of discretion in decision-making that affects clients can occasionally be marked by racial biases and disparities. Drawing on the Racial Classification Model (RCM) for a theoretical model, this article examines how client ethnicity shapes public employees' decisions to sanction clients. Using Danish employment agencies as our empirical setting, we present findings from two complementary studies. Study 1 uses nationwide administrative data. Examining sanctioning activity at the employment agency-level, we find that agencies with a larger percentage of clients being non-Western immigrants or their descendants impose a greater overall number of sanctions and dispense them with greater frequency. Study 2 uses survey experimental data to build on this finding. Addressing concerns about internal validity and a need for analyses at the individual employee-level, we present survey experimental evidence that employment agency caseworkers are more likely to recommend sanctions for ethnic minority (Middle-Eastern origin) clients than for ethnic majority (Danish origin) clients. Moreover, we investigate how three caseworker characteristics-ethnicity, gender, and work experience-condition the relationship between client ethnicity and caseworkers' decisions to sanction clients. Although we find no moderation effects for ethnicity or gender, work experience appears to diminish the influence of client ethnicity on the caseworkers' sanctioning decisions. Overall, our studies support the likelihood that ethnic minority clients will be punished more often for policy infractions than ethnic majority clients-and that caseworker work experience mitigates part of this bias. © The Author(s) 2018.

Uncertainty about social interactions leads to the evolution of social heuristics,"Individuals face many types of social interactions throughout their lives, but they often cannot perfectly assess what the consequences of their actions will be. Although it is known that unpredictable environments can profoundly affect the evolutionary process, it remains unclear how uncertainty about the nature of social interactions shapes the evolution of social behaviour. Here, we present an evolutionary simulation model, showing that even intermediate uncertainty leads to the evolution of simple cooperation strategies that disregard information about the social interaction ('social heuristics'). Moreover, our results show that the evolution of social heuristics can greatly affect cooperation levels, nearly doubling cooperation rates in our simulations. These results provide new insight into why social behaviour, including cooperation in humans, is often observed to be seemingly suboptimal. More generally, our results show that social behaviour that seems maladaptive when considered in isolation may actually be well-adapted to a heterogeneous and uncertain world. © 2018 The Author(s).","Van Den Berg, P.; Wenseleers, T.",Nat.

What influences public views on forensic DNA testing in the criminal field? A scoping review of quantitative evidence,"BACKGROUND: Forensic DNA testing is a powerful tool used to identify, convict, and exonerate individuals charged of criminal offenses, but there are different views on its benefits and risks. Knowledge about public views on forensic DNA testing applied in the criminal field is socially valuable to practitioners and policymakers. This paper aims to synthesize quantitative evidence about the factors that influence public views on forensic DNA testing in the criminal field. Based on a systematic search conducted in January 2019, a scoping review was performed, targeting studies presenting original empirical data that were indexed in Web of Science and PubMed. The two authors performed eligibility and data extraction. RESULTS: The 11 studies were conducted mainly in European countries (Italy, Portugal, Serbia, Spain, Switzerland) and the remaining derived from the USA and New Zealand. Non-representative samples were mostly used to explore the benefits and risks of criminal DNA databases, criteria for insertion and retention of DNA samples and profiles, knowledge, willingness to donate a DNA sample, and custody. The value of forensic DNA databases in protecting society from crime was emphasized. Concerns about improper access to forensic genetic data and risks to civil liberties associated with its uses were expressed. The scarce literature on Forensic DNA Phenotyping and familial searching revealed the same trend of positively valuing forensic DNA testing. Only factors related with socioeconomic position were assessed by more than two studies. Results suggested that public views on forensic DNA testing are influenced by the level of education, age, and exposure to law enforcement occupations although not in a straightforward manner. CONCLUSION: Further empirical research should assess standardized factors related with social and structural levels (e.g., scientific literacy, public trust in the justice system and concerns about victimization or police activity) and be performed in different national jurisdictions to enable generalization and comparison of findings. It is needed to expand empirical studies on public views about the commercialization of forensic science and the use of recent controversial techniques and new transparency and accountability models.","Machado, Helena; Silva, Susana",Hum.

Choosing an equitable or efficient option: A distribution dilemma,"We conducted a 3 × 3 × 2 experiment to verify the moral preference hypothesis and extend the boundary conditions of the moral frame effect. Participants played a trade-off game (TOG), in which they unilaterally choose between an equitable or efficient option. We manipulated the labeling of the options to describe the equitable versus efficient option as morally right, and controlled the amount of the stakes and division schemes in the TOG. We found there was a significant effect of moral frame when stakes were low in the TOG, and participants would choose a morally right option whether it was equitable or efficient. However, the effect of moral frame was nonsignificant when the stakes were high. In addition, the division schemes in the TOG had a great impact on the moral frame effect. Therefore, we found that when participants’ interest in the options remains the same or the changes are small, and other players’ interest changes greatly, the moral frame effect is not significant. © 2019 Scientific Journal Publishers Limited.

Altruism in Humans,"This book takes a hard-science look at the possibility that we humans have the capacity to care for others for their sakes (altruism) rather than simply for our own (egoism). The look is based not on armchair speculation, dramatic cases, or after-the-fact interviews, but on an extensive series of theory-testing laboratory experiments conducted over the past 35 years. Part I details the theory of altruistic motivation that has been the focus of this experimental research. The theory centers on the empathy-altruism hypothesis, which claims that other-oriented feelings of sympathy and compassion for a person in need (empathic concern) produce motivation with the ultimate goal of having that need removed. Antecedents and consequences of empathy-induced altruistic motivation are specified, making the theory empirically testable. Part II offers a comprehensive summary of the research designed to test the empathy-altruism hypothesis, giving particular attention to recent challenges. Overall, the research provides remarkably strong and consistent support for this hypothesis, forcing a tentative conclusion that empathy-induced altruism is within the human repertoire. Part III considers the theoretical and practical implications of this conclusion, suggesting that empathy-induced altruism is a far more pervasive and powerful force in human affairs than has been recognized. Failure to appreciate its importance has handicapped attempts to understand why we humans act as we do and wherein our happiness lies. This failure has also handicapped efforts to promote better interpersonal relations and create a more caring, humane society. © 2011 by Oxford University Press, Inc.

"Contributions of Mainstream Sexual Media Exposure to Sexual Attitudes, Perceived Peer Norms, and Sexual Behavior: A Meta-Analysis","Purpose: Decades of research have examined the impact of exposure to nonexplicit portrayals of sexual content in media. There is only one meta-analysis on this topic, which suggests that exposure to “sexy media” has little to no effect on sexual behavior. There are a number of limitations to the existing meta-analysis, and the purpose of this updated meta-analysis was to examine associations between exposure to sexual media and users' attitudes and sexual behavior. Methods: A thorough literature search was conducted to find relevant articles. Each study was coded for associations between exposure to sexual media and one of six outcomes including sexual attitudes (permissive attitudes, peer norms, and rape myths) and sexual behaviors (general sexual behavior, age of sexual initiation, and risky sexual behavior). Results: Results from 59 studies, involving 394 effect sizes, revealed that exposure to sexual media had a small but significant effect on both sexual attitudes and behaviors; the effect size was comparable to other media effects meta-analyses. Effects were stronger for adolescents than emerging adults. In addition, effects were stronger for boys than girls and for white participants compared with black participants. Conclusion: This study suggests that exposure to nonexplicit sexual media is associated with both sexual attitudes and behavior, particularly during adolescence. Implications for parents, media producers, and researchers are discussed. © 2018 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine","Coyne, S.M.; Ward, L.M.; Kroff, S.L.; Davis, E.J.; Holmgren, H.G.; Jensen, A.C.; Erickson, S.E.; Essig, L.W.",J.

The importance of managerial capacity in fundraising: Evidence from land conservation charities,"The objective of this paper is to show the importance of incorporating managerial capacity into the empirical analysis of the determinants of donations to charitable organizations. We adopt a production function approach to model the outcome of the fundraising process. The empirical findings suggest that managerial capacity is an important factor determining charitable donations. This finding is qualitatively robust using a variety of different estimation strategies including Olley and Pakes style estimators, dynamic panel data estimators, standard IV estimators, and fixed effects estimators. In contrast, estimates of the two other input factors, fund-raising expenditures and government grants, are sensitive with respect to different identification strategies, sample selection rules, and missing data imputation mechanisms. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Sieg, H.; Zhang, J.",Int J Ind Organiz,1341
Artificial surveillance cues do not increase generosity: two meta-analyses,"Many studies have seemingly demonstrated that anonymous individuals who are shown artificial cues of being watched behave as if they are being watched by real people. However, several studies have failed to replicate this surveillance cue effect. In light of these mixed results, we conducted two meta-analyses investigating the effect of artificial observation cues on generosity. Overall, our meta-analyses found no evidence to support the claim that artificial surveillance cues increase generosity, either by increasing how generous individuals are, or by increasing the probability that individuals will show any generosity at all. Therefore, surveillance cue effects should be interpreted cautiously.

Also investigated was whether sex differences existed in children's development of empathy and humane attitudes resulting from play, as well as their feelings for a virtual pet. The results showed that after playing Nintendogs for 3 weeks, the participants of both sexes, on average, scored higher levels of empathy on the Bryant Empathy Index, and had higher levels of humane attitudes on the Intermediate Attitude Scale, compared to their pretest scores before they played. A statistical association also was revealed between time playing with a computer-simulated animal and improved scores in empathy and humane attitudes toward animals. The findings also showed that participants tended to form emotional attachments with their virtual pet and considered it a real pet.","Tsai, Y.-F.; Kaufman, D.",J. Educ. Comput. Res.,1343
Low-dose aspirin for in vitro fertilization: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Since there were no significant differences between low-dose aspirin and control for any pregnancy-related outcome in women undergoing IVF or ICSI, treatment with low-dose aspirin cannot be routinely recommended. XCM: The review question was stated clearly. Several relevant sources were searched and attempts were made to minimise publication and language bias. Appropriate methods were used to minimise reviewer error and bias during the study selection and data extraction processes, but the methods used to assess validity were unclear. Only RCTs were included and validity was apparently assessed but, since the results of this assessment were not reported, it is not possible to evalute the quality of the included studies. The authors included only certain RCTs in the meta-analyses but did not explicitly describe the criteria governing eligibility for inclusion in such analyses; this makes the results more difficult to interpret. It was not clear whcih outcomes were assessed for individual studies and even more unclear whether ICSI was actually assessed. Appropriate methods were used for the meta-analyses and heterogeneity was assessed. The evidence presented appears to support the authors’ conclusions, but the lack of reporting of study quality and other limitations of the review make it difficult to assess the strength of the evidence. XIM: Practice: The authors stated that low-dose aspirin should not be given routinely to women undergoing assisted conception. Research: The authors stated that future studies should assess the effect of low-dose aspirin on stimulation cycle outcome and maternal and neonatal morbidity, as well as the pregnancy rate. There is a need for further studies of aspirin in women with a poor response to ovarian stimulation and women who receive donated oocytes before aspirin can be recommended for these situations.","Gelbaya, T A; Kyrgiou, M; Li, T C; Stern, C; Nardo, L G",,1344
Bargaining under surveillance: Evidence from a three-person ultimatum game,This paper investigates how the transparency of decision-making affects preferences over distributional outcomes. We also examine what motivates individuals to voluntarily invest economic resources to monitor decision-making processes. We find that third-party monitoring does not affect distributional outcomes in a three-person ultimatum game. Our results show that a large majority of individuals is willing to pay for a right to monitor decision-making processes despite pecuniary incentives to the contrary. We observe that third-parties are over-confident in believing that an opportunity to scrutinize decision-making processes changes distributional outcomes for their own benefit. Our results suggest that people may over-estimate the effect of transparent decision-making on economic outcomes. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.,"Sääksvuori, L.; Ramalingam, A.",J. Econ. Psychol.,1345

Development of a Market Orientation Research Agenda for the Nonprofit Sector,"Market orientation is the overarching framework by which practitioners and academics make sense of the interplay between customers, competition, stakeholders, and the organization within the commercial for-profit arena and is the way the marketing concept is put into practice. Many academics have argued that market orientation would also benefit nonprofit organizations by generating more funds in an increasingly competitive environment. The purpose of this article is to conduct a systematic review of market orientation, identify gaps, and develop a research agenda for market orientation research within the underresearched nonprofit sector. This research agenda highlights the structural, human resource, and cultural challenges nonprofit organizations face if they decide to adopt a market orientation, and the need to develop a praxis framework currently missing from the literature.

The current study uses regulatory fit theory to examine how a fit between goals and means of compliance-gaining messages affects compliance. A field experiment was conducted in which subjects were presented with a compliance-gaining request in which goals and means were varied. Results indicated that compliance rates and donation amounts were higher under conditions of fit between the regulatory orientation of goals and means rather than non-fit. Findings are discussed in light of their implications for compliance-gaining research and regulatory fit theory. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Shaw, A.Z.; Dolan, E.A.; Yurgalite, L.; Walton, J.A.; Underwood, K.",Soc.

An exploratory test for an excess of significant findings,"Background: The published clinical research literature may be distorted by the pursuit of statistically significant results. Purpose: We aimed to develop a test to explore biases stemming from the pursuit of nominal statistical significance. Methods: The exploratory test evaluates whether there is a relative excess of formally significant findings in the published literature due to any reason (e.g., publication bias, selective analyses and outcome reporting, or fabricated data). The number of expected studies with statistically significant results is estimated and compared against the number of observed significant studies. The main application uses α = 0.05, but a range of α thresholds is also examined. Different values or prior distributions of the effect size are assumed. Given the typically low power (few studies per research question), the test may be best applied across domains of many meta-analyses that share common characteristics (interventions, outcomes, study populations, research environment). Results: We evaluated illustratively eight meta-analyses of clinical trials with >50 studies each and 10 meta-analyses of clinical efficacy for neuroleptic agents in schizophrenia; the 10 meta-analyses were also examined as a composite domain. Different results were obtained against commonly used tests of publication bias. We demonstrated a clear or possible excess of significant studies in 6 of 8 large meta-analyses and in the wide domain of neuroleptic treatments. Limitations: The proposed test is exploratory, may depend on prior assumptions, and should be applied cautiously. Conclusions: An excess of significant findings may be documented in some clinical research fields. © Society for Clinical Trials 2007.","Ioannidis, J.P.A.; Trikalinos, T.A.",Clin. Trials,1349
Social media and the social sciences: How researchers employ Big Data analytics,"Social media posts are full of potential for data mining and analysis. Recognizing this potential, platform providers increasingly restrict free access to such data. This shift provides new challenges for social scientists and other non-profit researchers who seek to analyze public posts with a purpose of better understanding human interaction and improving the human condition. This paper seeks to outline some of the recent changes in social media data analysis, with a focus on Twitter, specifically. Using Twitter data from a 24-hour period following The Sisters in Spirit Candlelight Vigil, sponsored by the Native Women?s Association of Canada, this article compares three free-use Twitter application programming interfaces for capturing tweets and enabling analysis. Although recent Twitter data restrictions limit free access to tweets, there are many dynamic options for social scientists to choose from in the capture and analysis of Twitter and other social media platform data. This paper calls for critical social media data analytics combined with traditional, qualitative methods to address the developing ?data gold rush.?","Felt, Mylynn",Big Data & Society,1350

Conformity to implicit social pressure: the role of political identity,"Although studies have shown that implicit social cues, such as images of watchful eyes, can elicit prosocial behavior, little research to date has examined individual differences in people’s susceptibility to such subtle social cues. For example, individuals with a conservative ideology typically value social conformity, obedience, and adherence to social norms more than liberals. To examine partisan heterogeneity, we analyze data from two large randomized field experiments on voting behavior. Results suggest that the impact of eyespots on voter mobilization is indeed likely driven by political identity, with a significant effect for Republicans but not Independents or Democrats. These findings are consistent with an emerging line of research revealing individual differences in how susceptible humans are to implicit social cues. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Panagopoulos, C.; van der Linden, S.",Soc.

Spine 2006;31:1381-7. XRE: No statistically significant differences in the two clinical end points were found. For example, the 12-month EQ-5D values were 0.770 (+/- 0.3) in the BPM group and 0.785 (+/- 0.3) in the PT group. The difference was -0.014 (95% confidence interval, CI: -0.08 to 0.05; p>0.05).The change in RMDQ scores from baseline to 12-month follow-up was 8.709 (+/- 6.6) in the BPM group and 8.730 (+/- 7.3) in the PT group (difference -0.021, 95% CI: -1.39 to 1.35; p>0.05). XSM: Power calculations, if performed, were not reported. Of the 544 patients initially assessed for eligibility, 402 (74%) were finally included in the clinical study. There were 201 patients in each treatment group. XCO: Productivity costs were not included, although the number of days off work due to low back pain was recorded (and was similar between groups). However, this represented a secondary outcome of the study and was not costed. XCU: UK pounds sterling (). XSA: Missing data were imputed using multiple linear regression models. XSY: CIs were defined for the costs and benefits using conventional parametric methods and bias-corrected and accelerated bootstrapping. The issue of uncertainty was investigated by generating 5,000 bootstrapped replications of mean differences in costs and benefits. An acceptability curve was generated only for the incremental cost-utility ratios, which evaluated the probability that the new intervention (BPM) would be cost-effective at specific cost-per-QALY thresholds. A conventional sensitivity analysis was performed to explore the robustness of the results of the analysis to variations in the cost of private health care, which are likely to exceed those of the NHS. XEB: The expected QALYs (controlled for baseline values) were 0.755 in the BPM group and 0.777 in the PT group (difference -0.022; 95% CI: -0.07 to 0.02; p=0.35).The expected RMDQ change scores (controlled for baseline values) were 8.553 in the BPM group and 8.887 in the PT group (difference -0.334, 95% CI: -1.49 to 0.82; p=0.57). XCR: The total health care costs per patient for observed data (n=299) were 158.11 (+/- 282.2) in the BPM group and 219.90 (+/- 449.6) in the PT group (difference -61.79; p=0.15).The total health care costs per patient with imputed data (all patients) were 142.33 (+/- 261.3) in the BPM group and 194.52 (+/- 445.6) in the PT group (difference -52.19; p=0.15). XCB: An incremental analysis was performed to combine the costs and benefits of the alternative strategies.The incremental cost per QALY gained with PT over BPM was 2,362.Using a conservative threshold of 10,000 per QALY gained, the probability that BPM was cost-effective was only 17%. This suggested that there was an 83% chance that PT would be the preferred option.The cost-effectiveness analysis showed that the incremental cost per additional 1-point improvement in RMDQ change score at 12 months with PT over BPM was 156.The results of the sensitivity analysis corroborated the base-case findings. Further, increasing prices for private care did not alter the conclusions of the analysis. XAU: Physical therapy (PT) is a valid and cost-effective approach for patients with low-back pain in the UK. Brief pain management (BPM) administered in fewer sessions might represent a valid alternative strategy. XIM: The study results suggest that multiple treatment options might be available for the treatment of low back pain. Thus, additional factors such as patient and doctor preferences should be considered when choosing the optimal strategy.","Whitehurst, D G; Lewis, M; Yao, G L; Bryan, S; Raftery, J P; Mullis, R; Hay, E M",,1360
An eye-like painting enhances the expectation of a good reputation,"The presence of subtle cues of being watched has been reported to make people behave altruistically, even when they are anonymous. Individual selection theory predicts that generosity in the presence of eyes is based on the providers' expectation of a future reward. On the other hand, as we are living in quite a large society in which altruistic punishment is effective, the eyes could elicit fear of punishment. However, no previous study has investigated whether people are concerned with their reputation when subtle social cues are present. We conducted the dictator game in the presence of, or without, a painting of stylized eyes. The participants were then asked to complete a post-experimental questionnaire designed to investigate what they were thinking when they decided the amount of money to offer the recipient and how they perceived the experimental situation. Participants in the eye condition allocated more money to the recipient than did those in the control condition. This effect was not mediated by fear of punishment but by the expectation of a reward. Moreover, the results suggested that the participants expected their actions would enhance their reputation in the eyes of a third party. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.","Oda, R.; Niwa, Y.; Honma, A.; Hiraishi, K.",Evol.

A between-subjects replication in M-Turk provides results in the same direction, although the treatment effects are much weaker.

"Debt, donors, and the decision to give","Despite the enormous size of the nonprofit sector, there has been very little empirical research done on the capital structure of nonprofit organizations, and no one has examined the potential effects of borrowing on individual contributions. Using a representative sample of nonprofits, the empirical analysis first determines whether secured or unsecured borrowing by nonprofits influence future contributions. The results for the full sample support a ""crowding-out"" effect. When the analysis is repeated on a subsample of nonprofits that are older, larger, and more dependent upon donations, the results are more ambiguous: secured debt has little or no effect, while unsecured debt has a ""crowd-in"" effect. The empirical analysis is then expanded to test whether nonprofits with higher than average debt levels have different results than nonprofits with below average debt levels.

"Test of a concession procedure for inducing verbal, behavioral, and further compliance with a request to give blood","The rejection-then-retreat technique for inducing compliance involves a sequencing of requests for favors in which a requester begins by asking a target person for an extreme favor and, after being refused, retreats to a smaller favor (the one that was desired from the outset). Previous research has suggested that the power of this technique derives from the target's perception that a requester who employs it has made a concession and from the action of a societal rule for reciprocation of concessions. On the basis of evidence on the consequences of the perception of concession in an interaction, it was predicted that the rejection-then-retreat procedure would be superior to comparison procedures that did not involve a concession. This was found to be the case for verbal compliance, behavior compliance, and compliance with requests for subsequent favors. 189 Ss on a university campus were approached on campus with requests to donate blood. 100% of Ss refused to donate blood every 2 mo for a period of 3 yrs, but 84% of them agreed to comply with the subsequent critical request to donate 1 pint of blood.

Moral Reasoning and Personal Behavior: A Meta-Analytical Review,"The meta-analysis examined the effect of moral development on 4 domains of action (real life, honesty, altruism, and resistance to conformity), and on action in general. The database, comprised by 151 studies across 71 years, stemmed from a previous narrative synthesis conducted by Blasi (1980), updated with studies published up to 2013. Results showed that (a) moral development was significantly related to action in general and to each domain, (b) the effect sizes were similar for altruism, real life, and resistance to conformity, with coefficients higher than r = .20, (c) the effect size for honesty was lower than for the other 3 types of behaviors, and (d) demographic or methodological variables did not affect the association between moral development and action. Discussion centers on similarities among domains of action, perfect and imperfect duties, and the need for other constructs to account for moral action.

Empathy is hard work: People choose to avoid empathy because of its cognitive costs,"Empathy is considered a virtue, yet it fails in many situations, leading to a basic question: When given a choice, do people avoid empathy? And if so, why? Whereas past work has focused on material and emotional costs of empathy, here, we examined whether people experience empathy as cognitively taxing and costly, leading them to avoid it. We developed the empathy selection task, which uses free choices to assess the desire to empathize. Participants make a series of binary choices, selecting situations that lead them to engage in empathy or an alternative course of action. In each of 11 studies (N = 1,204) and a meta-analysis, we found a robust preference to avoid empathy, which was associated with perceptions of empathy as more effortful and aversive and less efficacious. Experimentally increasing empathy efficacy eliminated empathy avoidance, suggesting that cognitive costs directly cause empathy choice. When given the choice to share others' feelings, people act as if it is not worth the effort.

Communication Gift Code,"This study aims to clarify, from psycho-communicational point of view, what means to give a gift. To this end it starts from the basic theories and practices of the gift. It evokes the three paradigms of the gift (individualistic, holistic, contemporary), but also the difference between gift and charity, and between gift and American-Indian potlach. Then as material of study, the paper takes an accredited, authentic and valid situation in which a gift is made. This is a historical situation which is presented by Herodotus: during the campaign of conquest Scythia, King Darius of Persia receives from the Scythians kings, as a gift, a bird, a mouse, a frog, and five arrows. By applying procedures pertaining to the comparative method, to the semantic method, to the meta-analytical method and to the logical method, it detaches some characteristic of the gift and of the act of giving a gift. The main features of the gift are: character of communication phenomenon, intentionality, substitutability (metaphorical structure, metonymic structure, symbolic structure) and reciprocity. It concludes that the gift is a likely communicative activity: to give a gift means making explicit or implicit communicational meanings.","Teodorescu, B; Calin, R A; Busu, O V",NEW APPROACHES IN SOCIAL AND HUMANISTIC SCIENCES,1367
Do Donors Respond to Nonprofit Performance? Evidence from Housing,"Standard economic theories of nonprofits argue that donors largely cannot observe nonprofit performance. Using market data from the US nonprofit housing sector, federal financial data, and rare internal production reports, this study examines the effects of nonprofit performance on donations with a dynamic panel model. Donors in our sample are only weakly sensitive to indicators of nonprofit productivity. Our results imply that nonprofit performance theory might be distinct from other sectors in that nonprofits cannot expect increased performance to be meaningfully rewarded with funding. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Coupet, J.; Broussard, P.",Public Perform.

Using Large-Scale Social Media Experiments in Public Administration: Assessing Charitable Consequences of Government Funding of Nonprofits,"In this article, we introduce and showcase how social media can be used to implement experiments in public administration research. To do so, we pre-registered a placebo-controlled field experiment and implemented it on the social media platform Facebook. The purpose of the experiment was to examine whether government funding to nonprofit organizations has an effect on charitable donations. Theories on the interaction between government funding and charitable donations stipulate that government funding of nonprofit organizations either decreases (crowding-out), or increases (crowding-in) private donations. To test these competing theoretical predictions, we used Facebook's advertisement facilities and implemented an online field experiment among 296,121 Facebook users nested in 600 clusters. Through the process of cluster-randomization, groups of Facebook users were randomly assigned to different nonprofit donation solicitation ads, experimentally manipulating information cues of nonprofit funding. Contrary to theoretical predictions, we find that government funding does not seem to matter; providing information about government support to nonprofit organizations neither increases nor decreases people's propensity to donate. We discuss the implications of our empirical application, as well as the merits of using social media to conduct experiments in public administration more generally. Finally, we outline a research agenda of how social media can be used to implement public administration experiments. © 2019 The Author(s).","Jilke, S.; Lu, J.; Xu, C.; Shinohara, S.",J. Public Adm.

Does the NEA crowd out private charitable contributions to the arts?,"This paper investigates the mechanism by which the federal government's funding of the arts through the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) displaces private charitable con-tributions to non-profit arts organizations. I estimate that private charitable contributions to arts organizations increased by 50 to 60 cents due to a major funding cut to the NEA during the mid-1990s. These increases, however, also coincided with, on average, a 25 cent increase in fund-raising expenditures by arts organizations for ev-ery dollar decrease in government grants. The estimate of crowding out found in this paper is relatively large, particularly for a study using a micro-data set. I argue that an appropriate interpretation of an estimate of a crowding-out parameter, in general, depends crucially on the context.","Dokko, J.K.",Natl. Tax J.,1372
KIDS OR CASH? EXPLORING CHARTER SCHOOL RESPONSES TO DECLINING GOVERNMENT REVENUES,"While the literature is extensive on school districts' revenue sources, less research has been done on the impact of donations on school district funds. In this paper, we extend the theoretical literature on crowding out of private donations by government grants for one type of nonprofit firm, namely charter schools. The theoretical model leads us to focus on the key relationships among fundraising effort, enrollment (which is tied to federal and state funding) and donations. Using a dataset on Texas charter schools we adopt a two-stage approach to examine the empirical relationship between changes in nondonor revenues and the donations received by charter schools. Like the extensive empirical estimates of the effects of government grants on donations for other types of nonprofit firms, we find evidence of crowding-out with respect to our sample of charter schools. We also find a significant, positive effect of fundraising on donations with a $1 increase in fundraising associated to a $0.58 increase in donations, a pattern consistent with overinvestment in fundraising. Enrollments exhibit a robust inverse relationship to changes in nondonor revenues.

Learning in high stakes ultimatum games: An experiment in the Slovak Republic,"This paper reports an experiment involving an ultimatum bargaining game, played in the Slovak Republic. Financial stakes were varied by a factor of 25, and behavior was observed both when players were inexperienced and as they gained experience. Consistent with prior results, changes in stakes had only a small effect on play for inexperienced players. But the present experimental design allows us to observe that rejections were less frequent the higher the stakes, and proposals in the high stakes conditions declined slowly as subjects gained experience. This Slovak experiment is the first to detect a lower frequency of rejection when stakes are higher and this can be explained by the added power due to multiple observations per subject in the experimental design. A model of learning suggests that the lower rejection frequency is the reason that the proposers in the higher stakes conditions of the ultimatum game learn to make lower offers.","Slonim, R.; Roth, A.E.",Econom,1374
The Eyes as Windows Into Other Minds: An Integrative Perspective,"Eyes have been shown to play a key role during human social interactions. However, to date, no comprehensive cross-discipline model has provided a framework that can account for uniquely human responses to eye cues. In this review, I present a framework that brings together work on the phylogenetic, ontogenetic, and neural bases of perceiving and responding to eyes. Specifically, I argue for a two-process model: a first process that ensures privileged attention to information encoded in the eyes and is important for the detection of other minds and a second process that permits the decoding of information contained in the eyes concerning another person’s emotional and mental states. To some degree, these processes are unique to humans, emerge during different times in infant development, can be mapped onto distinct but interconnected brain regions, and likely serve critical functions in facilitating cooperative interactions in humans. I also present evidence to show that oxytocin is a key modulator of sensitive responding to eye cues. Viewing eyes as windows into other minds can therefore be considered a hallmark feature of human social functioning deeply rooted in our biology. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","Grossmann, T.",Perspect.

Argument-inconsistency in charity appeals: Statistical information about the scope of the problem decrease helping toward a single identified victim but not helping toward many non-identified victims in a refugee crisis context,"It is known that both the characteristics of the victims one can help and the existence of victims one cannot help influence economic helping decisions in suboptimal ways. The aim of this study was to systematically test if these two aspects interact with each other. In Studies 1 and 2, we created hypothetical charity appeals related to the Syrian refugee crisis and factorially manipulated characteristics of victims possible to help (one identified child/nine non-identified children) and presence of statistical information about the scope and nature of the problem (information-box absent/present). We found a significant interaction effect both when using self-rated helping intention (Study 1), and when using actual donation behavior as the dependent variable (Study 2). Statistical information decreased helping intentions toward a single identified child but had no, or even a small positive effect on helping nine non-identified children. In Study 3, non-student participants reading a charity appeal with both a story about one identified child and statistical information donated less often than participants reading appeals with either only a story about one identified child or only statistical information. We suggest that both emotional arguments (e.g., a story and picture of an identified child in need) and analytical arguments (e.g., detailed statistical information about the scope and nature of the problem) can make us more motivated to help refugees, but that mixing different argument-types can make charity appeals internally inconsistent and decrease donations. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Erlandsson, A.; Västfjäll, D.; Sundfelt, O.; Slovic, P.",J.

Interventions aimed at healthcare professionals to increase the number of organ donors: a systematic review,"BACKGROUND: The last decade, there have been many initiatives worldwide to increase the number of organ donors. However, it is not clear which initiatives are most effective. The aim of this study is to provide an overview of interventions aimed at healthcare professionals in order to increase the number of organ donors. METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Library for English language studies published until April 24, 2019. We included studies describing interventions in hospitals aimed at healthcare professionals who are involved in the identification, referral, and care of a family of potential organ donors. After the title abstract and full-text selection, two reviewers independently assessed each study's quality and extracted data. RESULTS: From the 18,854 records initially extracted from five databases, we included 22 studies in our review. Of these 22 studies, 14 showed statistically significant effects on identification rate, family consent rate, and/or donation rate. Interventions that positively influenced one or more of these outcomes were training of emergency personnel in organ donation, an electronic support system to identify and/or refer potential donors, a collaborative care pathway, donation request by a trained professional, and additional family support in the ICU by a trained nurse. The methodological quality of the studies was relatively low, mainly because of the study designs. CONCLUSIONS: Although there is paucity of data, collaborative care pathways, training of healthcare professionals and additional support for relatives of potential donors seem to be promising interventions to increase the number of organ donors.

Deciding advantageously before knowing the advantageous strategy,"Deciding advantageously in a complex situation is thought to require overt reasoning on declarative knowledge, namely, on facts pertaining to premises, options for action, and outcomes of actions that embody the pertinent previous experience. An alternative possibility was investigated: that overt reasoning is preceded by a nonconscious biasing step that uses neural systems other than those that support declarative knowledge. Normal participants and patients with prefrontal damage and decision- making defects performed a gambling task in which behavioral, psychophysiological, and self- account measures were obtained in parallel. Normals began to choose advantageously before they realized which strategy worked best, whereas prefrontal patients continued to choose disadvantageously even after they knew the correct strategy. Moreover, normals began to generate anticipatory skin conductance responses (SCRs) whenever they pondered e choice that turned out to be risky, before they knew explicitly that it was a risky choice, whereas patients never developed anticipatory SCRs, although some eventually realized which choices were risky. The results suggest that, in normal individuals, nonconscious biases guide behavior before conscious knowledge does. Without the help of such biases, overt knowledge may be insufficient to ensure advantageous behavior.","Bechara, A.; Damasio, H.; Tranel, D.; Damasio, A.R.",Science,1378
Understanding social preferences with simple tests,"Departures from self-interest in economic experiments have recently inspired models of ""social preferences."" We design a range of simple experimental games that test these theories more directly than existing experiments. Our experiments show that subjects are more concerned with increasing social welfare-sacrificing to increase the payoffs for all recipients, especially low-payoff recipients-than with reducing differences in payoffs (as supposed in recent models). Subjects are also motivated by reciprocity: they withdraw willingness to sacrifice to achieve a fair outcome when others are themselves unwilling to sacrifice, and sometimes punish unfair behavior.","Charness, G.; Rabin, M.",Q.

"Fear-then-relief, legitimizing a paltry contribution, and charity","Introduction The compliance literature describes multiple techniques of social influence. Some of them have proven effective at inducing compliance in the charity domain. One such technique is referred to as legitimizing a paltry contribution (LPC). There are theoretical grounds on which it can be assumed that this technique will be particularly effective in conditions in which a person feels relief from fear. Objective The aim of the study was to examine whether people who experience fear-relief sequences are more susceptible to the LPC technique than those in a neutral emotional state. Method In two field studies, some people experienced relief from fear, while others remained in a neutral emotional state. The participants were then asked to donate to a worthy cause. A request was formulated either in a standard way, or with the phrase ""even a penny will help"". Results The two experiments yielded consistent results. It turned out that the LPC technique was particularly effective when participants had experienced relief from fear. Conclusions The aforementioned pattern of results is important for the development of theoretical knowledge about techniques of social influence, and has direct practical implications. © 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS.","Dolinska, B.; Dolinski, D.",Rev.

This paper proposes a behavioral model with two components: a choice correspondence that depends on the endowed allocation and the menu of allocations available, and a preference ordering over endowment/menu pairs. The choice correspondence governs behavior when the proposer actually plays a game, and the preference ordering governs the proposer's willingness to play a particular game.

Theoretically, games in which game characters help and support each other in nonviolent ways should increase both short-term and long-term prosocial behaviors. We report three studies conducted in three countries with three age groups to test this hypothesis. In the correlational study, Singaporean middle-school students who played more prosocial games behaved more prosocially. In the two longitudinal samples of Japanese children and adolescents, prosocial game play predicted later increases in prosocial behavior. In the experimental study, U.S. undergraduates randomly assigned to play prosocial games behaved more prosocially toward another student.

The New Statistics: Why and How,"We need to make substantial changes to how we conduct research. First, in response to heightened concern that our published research literature is incomplete and untrustworthy, we need new requirements to ensure research integrity. These include prespecification of studies whenever possible, avoidance of selection and other inappropriate data-analytic practices, complete reporting, and encouragement of replication. Second, in response to renewed recognition of the severe flaws of null-hypothesis significance testing (NHST), we need to shift from reliance on NHST to estimation and other preferred techniques. The new statistics refers to recommended practices, including estimation based on effect sizes, confidence intervals, and meta-analysis. The techniques are not new, but adopting them widely would be new for many researchers, as well as highly beneficial. This article explains why the new statistics are important and offers guidance for their use. It describes an eight-step new-statistics strategy for research with integrity, which starts with formulation of research questions in estimation terms, has no place for NHST, and is aimed at building a cumulative quantitative discipline. © The Author(s) 2013.","Cumming, G.",Psychol.

Time pressure increases cooperation in competitively framed social dilemmas,"What makes people willing to pay costs to benefit others? Does such cooperation require effortful self-control, or do automatic, intuitive processes favor cooperation? Time pressure has been shown to increase cooperative behavior in Public Goods Games, implying a predisposition towards cooperation. Consistent with the hypothesis that this predisposition results from the fact that cooperation is typically advantageous outside the lab, it has further been shown that the time pressure effect is undermined by prior experience playing lab games (where selfishness is the more advantageous strategy). Furthermore, a recent study found that time pressure increases cooperation even in a game framed as a competition, suggesting that the time pressure effect is not the result of social norm compliance. Here, we successfully replicate these findings, again observing a positive effect of time pressure on cooperation in a competitively framed game, but not when using the standard cooperative framing. These results suggest that participants' intuitions favor cooperation rather than norm compliance, and also that simply changing the framing of the Public Goods Game is enough to make it appear novel to participants and thus to restore the time pressure effect. © 2014 Cone, Rand.","Cone, J.; Rand, D.G.",PLoS ONE,1388
On the Transportability of Laboratory Results,"The “transportability” of laboratory findings to other instances than the original implementation entails the robustness of rates of observed behaviors and estimated treatment effects to changes in the specific research setting and in the sample under study. In four studies based on incentivized games of fairness, trust, and reciprocity, we evaluate (1) the sensitivity of laboratory results to locally recruited student-subject pools, (2) the comparability of behavioral data collected online and, under varying anonymity conditions, in the laboratory, (3) the generalizability of student-based results to the broader population, and (4) with a replication at Amazon Mechanical Turk, the stability of laboratory results across research contexts. For the class of laboratory designs using incentivized games as measurement instruments of prosocial behavior, we find that rates of behavior and the exact behavioral differences between decision situations do not transport beyond specific implementations. Most clearly, data obtained from standard participant pools differ significantly from those from the broader population. This undermines the use of empirically motivated laboratory studies to establish descriptive parameters of human behavior. Directions of the behavioral differences between games, in contrast, are remarkably robust to changes in samples and settings. Moreover, we find no evidence for either anonymity effects nor mode effects potentially biasing laboratory measurement. These results underscore the capacity of laboratory experiments to establish generalizable causal effects in theory-driven designs. © The Author(s) 2019.","Bader, F.; Baumeister, B.; Berger, R.; Keuschnigg, M.",Sociol.

Exploring the effects of working for endowments on behaviour in standard economic games,"In recent years, significant advances have been made in understanding the adaptive (ultimate) and mechanistic (proximate) explanations for the evolution and maintenance of cooperation. Studies of cooperative behaviour in humans invariably use economic games. These games have provided important insights into the mechanisms that maintain economic and social cooperation in our species. However, they usually rely on the division of monetary tokens which are given to participants by the investigator. The extent to which behaviour in such games may reflect behaviour in the real world of biological markets - where money must be earned and behavioural strategies incur real costs and benefits - is unclear. To provide new data on the potential scale of this problem, we investigated whether people behaved differently in two standard economic games (public goods game and dictator game) when they had to earn their monetary endowments through the completion of dull or physically demanding tasks, as compared with simply being given the endowment. The requirement for endowments to be 'earned' through labour did not affect behaviour in the dictator game. However, the requirement to complete a dull task reduced cooperation in the public goods game among the subset of participants who were not familiar with game theory. There has been some effort to test whether the conclusions drawn from standard, token-based cooperation games adequately reflect cooperative behaviour 'in the wild.'However, given the almost total reliance on such games to study cooperation, more exploration of this issue would be welcome. Our data are not unduly worrying, but they do suggest that further exploration is needed if we are to make general inferences about human behaviour from the results of structured economic games. © 2011 Harrison, El Mouden.","Harrison, F.; El Mouden, C.",PLoS ONE,1390
Statistical methods for assessing the influence of study characteristics on treatment effects in 'meta-epidemiological' research,"Biases in systematic reviews and meta-analyses may be examined in 'meta-epidemiological' studies, in which the influence of trial characteristics such as measures of study quality on treatment effect estimates is explored. Published studies to date have analysed data from collections of meta-analyses with binary outcomes, using logistic regression models that assume that there is no between- or within-meta-analysis heterogeneity. Using data from a study of publication bias (39 meta-analyses, 394 published and 88 unpublished trials) and language bias (29 meta-analyses, 297 English language trials and 52 non-English language trials), we compare results from logistic regression models, with and without robust standard errors to allow for clustering on meta-analysis, with results using a 'meta-meta-analytic' approach that can allow for between- and within-meta-analysis heterogeneity. We also consider how to allow for the confounding effects of different trial characteristics. We show that both within- and between meta-analysis heterogeneity may be of importance in the analysis of meta-epidemiological studies, and that confounding exists between the effects of publication status and trial quality.

Money talks: Neural substrate of modulation of fairness by monetary incentives,"A unique feature of the human species is compliance with social norms, e.g., fairness, even though this normative decision means curbing self-interest. However, sometimes people prefer to pursue wealth at the expense of moral goodness. Specifically, deviations from a fairness-related normative choice have been observed in the presence of a high monetary incentive. The neural mechanism underlying this deviation from the fairness-related normative choice has yet to be determined. In order to address this issue, using functional magnetic resonance imaging we employed an ultimatum game (UG) paradigm in which fairness and a proposed monetary amount were orthogonally varied. We found evidence for a significant modulation by the proposed amount on fairness in the right lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the bilateral insular cortices. Additionally, the insular subregions showed dissociable modulation patterns. Inter-individual differences in the modulation effects in the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) accounted for inter-individual differences in the behavioral modulation effect as measured by the rejection rate, supporting the concept that the PFC plays a critical role in making fairness-related normative decisions in a social interaction condition. Our findings provide neural evidence for the modulation of fairness by monetary incentives as well as accounting for inter-individual differences. © 2014 Zhou, Wang, Rao, Yang and Li.","Zhou, Y.; Wang, Y.; Rao, L.-L.; Yang, L.-Q.; Li, S.",Front.

"Gratefully received, gratefully repaid: The role of perceived fairness in cooperative interactions","It is well documented that people would remunerate fair behaviours and penalize unfair behaviours. It is argued that individuals' reactions following the receipt of a gift depend on the perceived intentions of the donors. Fair intentions should prompt positive affect, like gratitude, triggering cooperative behaviours; while intended unfairness should trigger negative affect, like anger, fostering anti-social actions. It is, however, contended that when people lack information to infer others' intention they may use 'normative' beliefs about fairness - what a typical fair individual 'should' do in these circumstances - to guide their behaviour. In this experiment we examined this assertion. We had 122 participants play a one-shot, double-anonymous game with half playing as potential helpers (P1s) and half as recipients (P2s). Whether a participant was a P1 or P2 was chance-determined and all participants knew this. P1s decided whether to help P2s and whether to make their help unconditional (no repayment needed) or conditional (full or 'taxed' repayment). P2s decided whether to accept the offer and whatever conditions attached but were blind to the list of helping options available to P1s. We anticipated that recipients would refer to the 'injunctive norm' that 'fair people should help ""for free"" when it is only by chance that they are in a position to help'. Therefore, without knowing P1s' different helping options, unconditional offers should be rated by recipients as fairer than conditional offers, and this should be linked to greater gratitude with greater gratitude linked to greater reciprocation. Path analyses confirmed this serial mediation. The results showed that recipients of unconditional offers, compared to conditional ones, interpreted the helpers' motives as more helpful, experienced greater gratitude and were more eager to reciprocate. The behavioural data further revealed that, when given a latter option to default, 38% of recipients of conditional offers did so. © 2014 Ma et al.","Ma, L.K.; Tunney, R.J.; Ferguson, E.",PLoS ONE,1396

Reference-dependent sympathy,"Natural disasters and other traumatic events often draw a greater charitable response than do ongoing misfortunes, even those that may cause even more widespread misery, such as famine or malaria. Why is the response disproportionate to need? The notion of reference dependence critical to Prospect Theory (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979) maintains that self-utility, or benefit to self, is not absolute level of wealth but rather gain or loss relative to a reference point. Four studies show that sympathy (Study 1), dictator offers (Study 2), and judgments of deservingness (Study 3a) are reference-dependent: people respond greater to victims of loss than to victims of chronic conditions. This tendency goes away when people evaluate victims in comparison (Study 3b) and when evaluating affect-poor "" statistical victims"" , as compared to affect-rich "" identifiable victims"" (Study 4). Together, these results shed light on seemingly irrational patterns of humanitarian aid. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.","Small, D.A.",Organ. Behav. Hum. Decis. Processes,1403

Dictator game giving: Rules of fairness versus acts of kindness,"In both dictator and impunity games, one player, the dictator, divides a fixed amount of money between himself and one other, the recipient. Recent lab studies of these games have produced seemingly inconsistent results, reporting substantially divergent amounts of dictator giving. Also, one prominent explanation for some of these differences, the impact of experimenter observation, displayed weak explanatory power in a different but related lab game. Data from the new experiment reported here offers some explanations. We find that dictators determine how much they will give on the basis of the total money available for the entire experimental session, not on the basis of what is available per game. This explains the reported differences between impunity and dictator studies. When distributing a gift among several recipients, individual dictators show little tendency towards equal treatment. Also, we find no evidence for the experimenter observation effect. Comparison with earlier experiments suggests that differences in the context of the game, affected by differences in written directions and independent of experimenter observation, account for differences across dictator studies. We propose a hypothetical decision procedure, based on the notion that dictator giving originates with personal and social rules that effectively constrain self-interested behavior. The procedure provides a link between dictator behavior and a broader class of laboratory phenomena.","Bolton, G.E.; Katok, E.; Zwick, K.",Int. J. Game Theory,1405

Audience effects on moralistic punishment,"Punishment has been proposed as being central to two distinctively human phenomena: cooperation in groups and morality. Here we investigate moralistic punishment, a behavior designed to inflict costs on another individual in response to a perceived moral violation. There is currently no consensus on which evolutionary model best accounts for this phenomenon in humans. Models that turn on individuals' cultivating reputations as moralistic punishers clearly predict that psychological systems should be designed to increase punishment in response to information that one's decisions to punish will be known by others. We report two experiments in which we induce participants to commit moral violations and then present third parties with the opportunity to pay to punish wrongdoers. Varying conditions of anonymity, we find that the presence of an audience-even if only the experimenter-causes an increase in moralistic punishment. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Meta-analysis of experiments with matched groups or repeated measures designs,"Tests for experiments with matched groups or repeated measures designs use error terms that involve the correlation between the measures as well as the variance of the data. The larger the correlation between the measures, the smaller the error and the larger the test statistic. If an effect size is computed from the test statistic without taking the correlation between the measures into account, effect size will be overestimated. Procedures for computing effect size appropriately from matched groups or repeated measures designs are discussed.

Mixed feelings: Theories of and evidence on giving,"This paper examines possible motives and institutional factors that impact giving. Specifically, I consider alternative theories parallel to dictator experiments that generate evidence on both allocation decisions and their effect on feelings. A number of new empirical findings as well as new interpretations for previously reported findings result. A novel test distinguishes warm glow from impure altruism and rules out the former as the sole motive for giving. Very generous donations to charities that aid the needy (with modal gifts of the entire dictator's stakes) cannot be attributed to familiarity with the charities. A charity that offers a matching grant increases its revenues by drawing donors and donations away from one that does not, although aggregate charitable donations do not rise. Additional results on emotions paint a picture of ""mixed feelings:"" generosity creates good feelings when the recipients are charities and bad feelings when they are fellow students. No group of dictators, however, feels better, on average, than a control group that is given no opportunity to donate. I propose a simple model that accounts for these results on allocation behavior and feelings by incorporating elements of two approaches, unconditional altruism and social preference theories, that to date have mostly evolved independently. A critical feature of this model is the social norm, and the results of the experiments corroborate the theory in the context of two norms of distributive justice that are important to real world giving: equity and need. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The psychology of social impact,"Proposes a theory of social impact specifying the effect of other persons on an individual. According to the theory, when other people are the source of impact and the individual is the target, impact should be a multiplicative function of the strength, immediacy, and number of other people. Furthermore, impact should take the form of a power function, with the marginal effect of the Nth other person being less than that of the (N-2)th. When other people stand with the individual as the target of forces from outside the group, impact should be divided such that the resultant is an inverse power function of the strength, immediacy, and number of persons standing together.

Considering rational self-interest as a disposition: Organizational implications of other orientation,"In contrast with major theories of attitudes and behavior, the authors propose that individuals are not equally motivated to pursue their self-interests. The authors show that differences in other orientation affect the extent to which actions and attitudes reflect self-interested calculation (instrumental rationality) and the extent to which beliefs represent their external environment (epistemic rationality). These differences have consequences for processes underlying a wide range of attitudes and behavior typically assumed to be rationally self-interested. Thus, the authors' model exposes a common explanation for diverse organizational phenomena. It also clarifies inconsistencies surrounding the validity of certain attitudinal and motivational models, the relationship between job attitudes and actions, cross-cultural differences in attitudes and behavior, escalation of commitment, and the relationship between chief executive officer characteristics and organizational performance.","Meglino, B.M.; Audrey Korsgaard, M.",J.

The accuracy of maternal anthropometry measurements as predictor for spontaneous preterm birth: a systematic review,"Routine antenatal maternal anthropometric measurements are not useful in predicting the risk of pre-term birth before 37 weeks' gestation. XCM: This was a well-conducted and clearly reported review. The objective was clear and supported by well-defined inclusion criteria. An extensive literature search was conducted, although this might have benefited from further attempts to locate unpublished studies. Details of the review methodology were reported; these included appropriate attempts to minimise bias in the review process. Study quality was assessed and the results tabulated and discussed in the synthesis of the results. The authors did not provide details of the methods used to pool the results, therefore it was not possible to determine whether the methods used were appropriate. However, given the very poor LRs, this would not have affected the conclusions of this review. In addition, it is questionable whether there was any benefit of pooling the results. The authors' conclusions are supported by the data presented. XIM: Practice: The authors stated that routine antenatal maternal anthropometric measurements are not useful in predicting the risk of pre-term birth.Research: The authors stated that further studies should address the use of anthropometric measurements in combination with other tests, but need to use a more clinically appropriate reference standard of pre-term birth (e.g. birth before 32 to 34 weeks' gestation) and improve on the quality of their design.","Honest, H; Bachmann, L M; Ngai, C; Gupta, J K; Kleijnen, J; Khan, K S",,1412

After refusing the first large request, experimental subjects were presented with a moderate request, which involved a concession on the part of the requester, a relative gain to the subject, or both. The control subjects received the second request only. No significant differences were found between the experimental and control groups.

In this study, 30 Ss were first approached with a small request (answer 8 questions in a telephone survey) the size of which was virtually certain to guarantee compliance. 32 other Ss were first approached with a request sufficiently large to guarantee noncompliance (answer 50 questions). Ss in both of these conditions were subsequently approached with a moderately sized request (30 questions sponsored by a different public service organization). As predicted by self-perception theory, Ss in the small-initial-request condition showed a higher rate of compliance to the 2nd request (.519), whereas Ss in the large-initial-request condition showed a lower rate of compliance (.219) than Ss in the no-initial-request control condition (.333).

Spontaneous giving under structural inequality: Intuition promotes cooperation in asymmetric social dilemmas,"The present research investigates the role of intuitive mental processing on cooperation in experimental games involving structural inequality. Results from an experiment using conceptual priming to induce intuitive mental processing provide the first evidence that cooperation is promoted by intuition in an asymmetric context that distributes the gains from cooperation unequally among a group. Therefore, the results extend our understanding of the cognitive underpinnings of human cooperation by demonstrating the robustness of intuitive cooperation in games involving structural inequality regarding asymmetric gains from cooperation. Additionally, the results provide the first successful conceptual replication of the intuition-cooperation link using conceptual priming, therefore also contributing to the debate about the validity of previous research in other contexts. Taken together, the present research contributes to the literature on psychological and institutional mechanisms that promote cooperation. © 2015 Lotz Sebastian.","Lotz, S.",PLoS ONE,1418
A contingency view of the responses of voluntary social service organizations in Ontario to government cutbacks,"Voluntary organizations in Ontario have been thrust into a new environment; government funding on which they have traditionally counted has been reduced to the extent that actions have to be taken in order for some organizations to survive. Using a sample of 85 from a mailed survey to voluntary social service organizations in Toronto, we collected information on how organizational characteristics are influencing the actions taken in the face of these changes. We found that the alternatives considered factored into five dimensions: enhancing the image of the organization; cutting costs; developing strategic plans and accountability; implementing new tactics, such as user fees; and restructuring the governance and management structure. Analysis showed that younger organizations, smaller-sized agencies, and those with a diverse set of funding sources employ a wider range of options to deal with environmental challenges. Many of these options are directed at protecting the main mission of the organization and building awareness and marketing strength so that the organization reduces its susceptibility to environmental shifts.","Foster, M.K.; Meinhard, A.G.",Can.

The Limited Informativeness of Meta-Analyses of Media Effects,"In this issue of Perspectives on Psychological Science, Christopher Ferguson reports on a meta-analysis examining the relationship between children’s video game use and several outcome variables, including aggression and attention deficit symptoms (Ferguson, 2015, this issue). In this commentary, I compare Ferguson’s nonsignificant effects sizes with earlier meta-analyses on the same topics that yielded larger, significant effect sizes. I argue that Ferguson’s choice for partial effects sizes is unjustified on both methodological and theoretical grounds. I then plead for a more constructive debate on the effects of violent video games on children and adolescents. Until now, this debate has been dominated by two camps with diametrically opposed views on the effects of violent media on children. However, even the earliest media effects studies tell us that children can react quite differently to the same media content. Thus, if researchers truly want to understand how media affect children, rather than fight for the presence or absence of effects, they need to adopt a perspective that takes differential susceptibility to media effects more seriously. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","Valkenburg, P.M.",Perspect.

Chinese adolescents’ power distance value and prosocial behavior toward powerful people: A longitudinal study,"We were interested in how specific cultural value and adolescent social behavior would influence each other over time. Thus the present study explored the longitudinal and bidirectional relations between adolescents’ power distance value and prosocial behavior toward powerful people over a year. A sample of 434 Chinese adolescents participated in the investigation (initial mean age = 11.27; 54.15% females). The results based on cross-lagged models showed that, earlier prosocial behavior toward powerful people was positively correlated to subsequent power distance value, but not vice versa. The findings point toward an understanding of the important role of adolescent social behavior on his/her cultural value development, and also shed light on future research in terms of the interplay between cultural values and individual’s social behaviors in other cultures. © 2018 Fu et al.

Left ventricular assist devices,"For adults waiting for heart transplant, left VAD support has been shown to improve the survival rates, functional status and quality of life. Only limited evidence was available for children, but the survival rates appeared to be similar to those for adults. XCM: The aims of this review were clearly stated. The limitation of the search to studies published in English and French might have led to publication bias. The authors considered the quality of the studies and used a narrative synthesis to describe the overall results. This was appropriate given the variation in the studies included. While the inclusion criteria stated that only controlled studies would be included, much of the evidence presented came from case series. Information on the included studies was tabulated, although there was some discrepancy between the number of studies described in the narrative and that presented in the tables. This meant that it was difficult to calculate how many people were involved in the reviewed studies. In addition, one included study was not referenced. Given that the authors acknowledged that the evidence they found, from observational studies, is not as reliable as that from RCTs, their conclusions appear to reflect the data presented. XIM: Practice: The authors implied that although the use of left VADs appears to improve survival in practice, because of a shortage of donors, this would result in longer waiting lists for heart transplants. They also stated that the introduction of left VADs in the paediatric population would be more cost- effective and might not have negative effects on transplant waiting lists.Research: The authors did not state any implications for further research.",Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care.

Understanding the Dissolution of Nonprofit Organizations: A Financial Management Perspective,"The financial antecedents of nonprofit dissolution have not been well studied, although there is growing scholarly attention devoted to the dissolution of nonprofit organizations. Using longitudinal data on U.S. public charities from 2005 to 2015, this study employs the Cox proportional-hazards model to examine the effects of overhead costs and revenue mix on nonprofit dissolution. In particular, we find that spending on employee compensation and fundraising each has a nonlinear, U-shaped relationship with the likelihood of nonprofit dissolution. We also find that commercial nonprofits are less likely to dissolve than their noncommercial counterparts. Finally, revenue diversification has a favorable effect on nonprofits’ survival prospects.

Compassion fade: Affect and charity are greatest for a single child in need,"Charitable giving in 2013 exceeded $300 billion, but why do we respond to some life-saving causes while ignoring others? In our first two studies, we demonstrated that valuation of lives is associated with affective feelings (self-reported and psychophysiological) and that a decline in compassion may begin with the second endangered life. In Study 3, this fading of compassion was reversed by describing multiple lives in a more unitary fashion. Study 4 extended our findings to loss-frame scenarios. Our capacity to feel sympathy for people in need appears limited, and this form of compassion fatigue can lead to apathy and inaction, consistent with what is seen repeatedly in response to many large-scale human and environmental catastrophes. © 2014 Västfjäll et al.","Västfjäll, D.; Slovic, P.; Mayorga, M.; Peters, E.",PLoS ONE,1428

"Reputation, a universal currency for human social interactions","Decision rules of reciprocity include ‘I help those who helped me’ (direct reci- procity) and ‘I help those who have helped others’ (indirect reciprocity), i.e. I help those who have a reputation to care for others. A person’s reputa tion is a score that members of a social group update whenever they see the person interacting or hear at best multiple gossip about the person’s social interactions. Reputation is the current standing the person has gained from previous investments or refusal of investments in helping others. Is he a good guy, can I trust him or should I better avoid him as a social partner? A good reputation pays off by attracting help from others, even from strangers or members from another group, if the recipient’s reputation is known. Any costly investment in others, i.e. direct help, donations to charity, investment in averting climate change, etc. increases a person’s reputation. I shall argue and illustrate with examples that a person’s known reputation functions like money that can be used whenever the person needs help. Whenever possible I will present tests of predictions of evolutionary theory, i.e. fitness maximizing strategies, mostly by economic experiments with humans. © 2016 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Competitive helping increases with the size of biological markets and invades defection,"Cooperation between unrelated individuals remains a puzzle in evolutionary biology. Recent work indicates that partner choice can select for high levels of helping. More generally, helping can be seen as but one strategy used to compete for partners within a broader biological market, yet giving within such markets has received little mathematical investigation. In the present model, individuals help others to attract attention from them and thus receive a larger share of any help actively or passively provided by those others. The evolutionarily stable level of helping increases with the size of the biological market and the degree of partner choice. Furthermore, if individuals passively produce some no-cost help to partners, competitive helping can then invade populations of non-helpers because helpers directly benefit from increasing their access to potential partners. This framework of competitive helping demonstrates how high helping can be achieved and why different populations may differ in helping levels. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Barclay, P.",J. Theor.

Victim Number Effects in Charitable Giving: Joint Evaluations Promote Egalitarian Decisions,"Studies of victim number effects in charitable giving consistently find that people care more and help more when presented with an appeal to help an individual compared with an appeal to help multiple people in need. Across three online experiments (N = 1,348), Bayesian estimation revealed the opposite pattern when people responded to multiple appeals to help targets of different sizes (1, 2, 5, 7, and 12). In this joint evaluation context, participants donated more to larger groups, when appeals were presented in both ascending order (Study 1) and random order (Study 2). The pattern held whether or not participants saw an overview of all appeals at the start of the study and when a single individual was added to the array (Study 3). These results clarify how compassion fade findings typical of separate evaluations may not generalize to contexts in which people encounter multiple appeals within a short temporal window. © 2021 by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc.","Garinther, A.; Arrow, H.; Razavi, P.",Pers.

Dichotomization of Continuous Variables: The Implications for Meta-Analysis,"In many studies included in meta-analyses, the independent variable measure, the dependent variable measure, or both, have been artificially dichotomized, attenuating the correlation from its true value and resulting in (a) a downward distortion in the mean correlation and (b) an upward distortion in the apparent real variation of correlations across studies. We present (a) exact corrections for this distortion for the case in which only one of the variables has been dichotomized and (b) methods for making approximate corrections when both variables have been artificially dichotomized. These approximate corrections are shown to be quite accurate for most research data. Methods for weighting the resulting corrected correlations in meta-analysis are presented. These corrections make it possible for meta-analysis to yield approximately unbiased estimates of mean population correlations and their standard deviations despite the initial distortion in the correlations from individual studies.","Hunter, J.E.; Schmidt, F.L.",J.

Providing information about actual budget cuts increased the number of donors. Most new donors were recruited among respondents who had processed the information correctly, underlining the importance of effective communication. The magnitude of the information effect was stronger for citizens with lower levels of empathic concern, who are less likely to donate but can be converted into donors.

The pain-relieving effect of electro-acupuncture and conventional medical analgesic methods during oocyte retrieval: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials,"No method was found to be superior to another and no consensus on which method was best for pain relief during oocyte removal could be reached; clinical pregnancy rates were found to be similar. Low doses of lignocaine can be recommended in PCB and EA without premedication. XCM: This review addressed a clear research question and specified inclusion criteria for the study design, interventions and outcomes. The search was fairly limited as it only involved searches of MEDLINE and bibliographies, and only published studies were included in the review. This means that other relevant unpublished studies might have been missed. The quality assessment and data extraction appear to have been performed independently, but not the study selection, which, as the author discussed, increases the risk of bias. Study quality was assessed using relevant questions for RCTs and full results were presented for each study.Only three studies were considered similar enough to be combined in a meta-analysis, the methods of which appear reliable. However, a number of other studies used similar pain outcome measures and it was unclear why these were not also included in meta-analyses. There was little discussion of the results of studies assessing interventions other than EA, and the presentation of their results made it difficult to assess which interventions were beneficial. The meta-analysis provided conflicting results depending on whether average or maximum pain was used as the outcome, and the author highlighted the limitations of using VASs to measure pain. The author's conclusion, that no consensus could be made about which method was best for pain relief, appears reliable, although the limited search strategy and study selection by one person increases the risk of bias. However, the recommendation about lignocaine is not supported by the results presented. XIM: Practice: The author stated that low doses of lignocaine can be recommended for pain relief in PCB, as well as EA without premedication. Conscious sedation is appropriate in patients who are willing and cooperative. As pain is subjective, the optimal method of conscious sedation should be made on an individual basis.Research: The author stated that further research is needed to identify the impact and significance of different needle locations and stimulation frequencies in EA. There is also a need to examine the effects of method of analgesia on IVF outcomes. Only RCTs should be conducted in future, using standardised outcome measures, measuring pain during oocyte removal, and using newer methods of pain assessment.",Stener-Victorin E,,1438

Negotiating with yourself and losing: Making decisions with competing internal preferences,"The field of organizational behc vior includes the study of how individuals organize and manage conflict among themselves. Less visible has been the study of conflicts occurring within individuals. We propose that one form of intrapersonal conflict is the result of tension between what people want to do versus what they think they should do. We argue that this want/should distinction helps to explain the ""multiple-selves"" phenomenon and a recently discovered group of preference reversals noted in behavioral decision and organizational behavior research. We develop a history of knowledge on intrapersonal conflict, discuss how conflicts between what one wants to do and what one should do result in inconsistent behavior, connect this pattern of inconsistency to recent literature on joint versus separate preference reversals, and outline prescriptions for the management of intrapersonal conflict.","Bazerman, M.H.; Tenbrunsel, A.E.; Wade-Benzoni, K.",Acad.

Are tax-financed contributions to a public good completely crowded-out? Experimental evidence,"We report the results of a laboratory experiment on crowd-out in a voluntary contribution mechanism public good game. In our setting, a standard argument states that a tax should not be effective in raising contributions, because agents respond by reducing voluntary contributions by the amount of the tax. Our experimental design focuses in on this intuition by abstracting away from several potential confounds. We use a specification for the payoff function in which there is a dominant strategy for own-earnings maximizing agents, located interior to and in the upper half of the strategy space. The dominant strategy ensures that changes in contributions are attributable to the tax directly, rather than second-order effects due to responses to out-of-equilibrium play by other agents. The dominant strategy is made more transparent by the use of a novel graphical decision interface. We find that individuals robustly choose at or above the own-earnings dominant strategy level. Even with the controls of the design, crowd-out is incomplete, but the degree of crowd-out is higher than in previous studies. Analysis of individual-level decisions provides evidence of different player types. Behavior of subjects not choosing the dominant or Pareto-efficient contributions is well-organized by a model of warm-glow giving with a logit decision error. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Gronberg, T.J.; Luccasen, R.A.; Turocy, T.L.; Van Huyck, J.B.",J.

The most frequent mistake has been the attempt to address the accuracy of the estimate of the mean effect size using ""confidence intervals"" based on the corrected standard deviation instead of on the standard error of the mean r or d. The corrected standard deviation should be used to generate a ""credibility interval"" to assess the extent to which moderators might account for the unexplained variance in effect sizes.","Whitener, E.M.",J.

Experimental practices in economics: A methodological challenge for psychologists?,"This target article is concerned with the implications of the surprisingly different experimental practices in economies and in areas of psychology relevant to both economists and psychologists, such as behavioral decision making. We consider four features of experimentation in economics, namely, script enactment, repeated trials, performance-based monetary payments, and the proscription against deception, and compare them to experimental practices in psychology, primarily in the area of behavioral decision making. Whereas economists bring a precisely defined ""script"" to experiments for participants to enact, psychologists often do not provide such a script, leaving participants to infer what choices the situation affords. By often using repeated experimental trials, economists allow participants to learn about the task and the environment; psychologists typically do not. Economists generally pay participants on the basis of clearly defined performance criteria; psychologists usually pay a flat fee or grant a fixed amount of course credit. Economists virtually never deceive participants; psychologists, especially in some areas of inquiry, often do. We argue that experimental standards in economics are regulatory in that they allow for little variation between the experimental practices of individual researchers. The experimental standards in psychology, by contrast, are comparatively laissez-faire. We believe that the wider range of experimental practices in psychology reflects a lack of procedural regularity that may contribute to the variability of empirical findings in the research fields under consideration. We conclude with a call for more research on the consequences of methodological preferences, such as the use on monetary payments, and propose a ""do-it-both-ways"" rule regarding the enactment of scripts, repetition of trials, and performance-based monetary payments. We also argue, on pragmatic grounds, that the default practice should be not to deceive participants.","Hertwig, R.; Ortmann, A.",Behav. Brain Sci.,1452
Methods for measuring hand hygiene behavior - A methodological examination from a behavioral scientific perspective,"The present work provides an up-to-date overview on different methodological approaches to the measurement of hand hygiene in health care settings. We address the status quo as well as current developments in hand hygiene compliance research and expand this perspective by considering relevant findings from behavioral sciences. Regarding the measurement methods we distinguish four categories: product consumption, self-report, observation und automated methods. Regarding the evaluation of the methods we discuss level of information of hand hygiene data, feasibility of methods and reliability of collected data. In the conclusion we discuss the suitability of particular methods for different research questions regarding hand hygiene and propose video-based observation as an alternative to the current gold standard, direct observation.","Diefenbacher, S.; Siegel, A.; Keller, J.",Hyg.

Compassion: An Evolutionary Analysis and Empirical Review,"What is compassion? And how did it evolve? In this review, we integrate 3 evolutionary arguments that converge on the hypothesis that compassion evolved as a distinct affective experience whose primary function is to facilitate cooperation and protection of the weak and those who suffer. Our empirical review reveals compassion to have distinct appraisal processes attuned to undeserved suffering; distinct signaling behavior related to caregiving patterns of touch, posture, and vocalization; and a phenomenological experience and physiological response that orients the individual to social approach. This response profile of compassion differs from those of distress, sadness, and love, suggesting that compassion is indeed a distinct emotion. We conclude by considering how compassion shapes moral judgment and action, how it varies across different cultures, and how it may engage specific patterns of neural activation, as well as emerging directions of research. © 2010 American Psychological Association.","Goetz, J.L.; Keltner, D.; Simon-Thomas, E.",Psychol.

The efficacy of technologies to minimise peri-operative allogeneic transfusion,"The main findings were that aprotinin, tranexamic acid, erythropoietin (both to augment autologous predonation and on its own) and pre-operative autologous donation all decrease exposure to peri-operative allogeneic blood transfusion. Desmopressin is not efficacious and there are too few trials of epsilon aminocaproic acid to establish its efficacy. There was too great a heterogeneity in the meta-analysis of acute normovolaemic haemodilution (ANH) and most of the trials were of such poor methodological quality that it is presently difficult to determine whether ANH is efficacious or not. XCM: The aims were stated and inclusion criteria defined in terms of study design, intervention, outcome, and participants. Searches were conducted of two databases, no language restrictions were applied and attempts were made to locate unpublished material. Methods used to select primary studies were not described. Eligible studies were restricted to RCTs and validity was assessed and scored using defined criteria. Methods used to extract data were described, but only minimal information on individual studies was presented. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed but not always reported and methods used were not stated. Forest plots were used to demonstrate homogeneity. When heterogeneity was found, several potential sources were investigated. Various sub-group analyses were conducted. The discussion includes consideration of the following limitations of the review: small sample size of most of the included studies requiring results, especially sub-group analyses, to be interpreted with caution; unexplained heterogeneity in the meta-analysis of ANH; and frequency of post-operative myocardial infarction, the need for re-operation because of bleeding, and side-effects were not reported in all studies.The evidence supports the authors' conclusions. XIM: Practice: The authors state that aprotinin, TXA, erythropoietin (both to augment autologous predonation and on its own) and PAD all decrease exposure to peri-operative allogeneic blood transfusion. Desmopressin is not efficacious and there are too few trials of EACA to establish its efficacy. There was too great a heterogeneity in the meta-analysis of ANH and most of the trials were of such poor methodological quality that it is presently difficult to determine whether ANH is efficacious or not.Research: The authors state that further large randomised trials using clear transfusion guidelines are required. Questions of particular interest included comparisons of high and low doses of aprotinin, determining whether ANH is efficacious, establishing whether desmopressin truly is efficacious in cardiac patients on aspirin, and direct comparisons of these technologies with each other and with 'optimal clinical management'. Economic evaluations should be incorporated into the design of these studies to determine the cost-effectiveness of the various options, and side-effects should be carefully evaluated.","Laupacis A, Fergusson D",,1457
My avatar behaves well and this feels right: Ideal and ought selves in video gaming,"Prosocial and violent games were investigated in relation to empathy with avatars and amount of postgame donation. Participants who played a prosocial game demonstrated greater empathy, while those who played a violent game said they would donate a greater amount of money. Flow was found to be a function of the 3-way interaction between game type, self-perception, and regulatory focus.

Is it all about the self? The effect of self-control depletion on ultimatum game proposers,"In the ultimatum-game, as in many real-life social exchange situations, the selfish motive to maximize own gains conflicts with fairness preferences. In the present study we manipulated the availability of cognitive-control resources for ultimatum-game proposers to test whether preference for fairness is a deliberative cognitive-controlled act or an automatic act. In two experiments we found that a shortage of cognitive control (ego depletion) led proposers in the ultimatum game (UG) to propose significantly more equal split offers than non-depleted proposers. These results can be interpreted as resulting from an automatic concern for fairness, or from a greater fear of rejection, which would be in line with a purely self-interested response. To separate these competing explanations, in Experiment 2 we conducted a dictator-game in which the responder cannot reject the offer. In contrast to the increased fairness behavior demonstrated by depleted ultimatum-game proposers, we found that depleted dictator-game allocators chose the equal split significantly less often than non-depleted allocators. These results indicate that fairness preferences are automatically driven among UG proposers. The automatic fair behavior, however, at least partially reflects concern about self-interest gain. We discuss different explanations for these results. © 2013 Halali, Bereby-Meyer and Ockenfels.","Halali, E.; Bereby-Meyer, Y.; Ockenfels, A.",Front. Human Neurosci.,1459
Dishonest behavior is not affected by an image of watching eyes,"Previous research has demonstrated that implicit reputation cues promote prosocial behaviors. However, the effect of implicit reputation cues on dishonesty has not been investigated in the laboratory. An image depicting observant eyes has been used as an implicit reputation cue in previous studies. Three experiments were conducted to investigate whether the use of such an image was significantly associated with dishonesty. In the current study, participants had opportunities to cheat to obtain higher economic profits (Experiments 1 and 2) or to appear more intelligent (Experiments 1 and 3). The participants were randomly assigned to the watching eyes image or a neutral image conditions. There was no difference in the extent of dishonesty between the two conditions. Notably, these results were consistent across different tasks and different motivations for dishonesty. Our results extended findings from previous studies on the effects of an image of watching eyes and demonstrated that implicit reputation cues may not decrease dishonest behaviors. Thus, explicit reputation cues may be necessary in interventions for dishonesty. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Cai, W.; Huang, X.; Wu, S.; Kou, Y.",Evol. Hum. Behav.,1460

Sharing the Fruit of Labor: Flexible Application of Justice Principles in an Ultimatum Game with Joint-Production,"Individuals often need to negotiate how to distribute jointly produced goods-equally (e. g., 50:50) or equitably (e. g., proportionally to their contributions). We examined whether people have stable preferences, or whether they switch between equality and equity in different situations. Pairs of anonymous participants first produced a common pie, and then distributed it in an ultimatum game. Results suggest that individuals apply different justice principles depending on their contribution. When they produced less than 50%, proposers divided the pie equally. However, when they produced more than 50%, their offers fell between equality and equity. Responders' ratings of fairness and satisfaction varied similarly; with low production, equality was preferred, whereas with high production, equity was preferred. Nevertheless, equal and equitable offers were generally accepted, and only outright unfair offers were rejected. This suggests that individuals are relatively flexible about which justice principle should be applied, but punish proposers whose offers violate both principles. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Bediou, B.; Sacharin, V.; Hill, C.; Sander, D.; Scherer, K.R.",Soc.

Are government transfers harmful to economic growth? A meta-analysis,"A common perception is that government transfers are harmful to economic growth. However, existing empirical evidence on this point is mixed. Potential reasons for these conflicting results include differences in the level of economic development of the countries studied, different estimation methods and different measures of government transfers. By conducting a meta-analysis of 149 estimates reported in 23 studies, we sought to understand if – and if so, to what extent – government transfers are harmful to economic growth, as well as how important the abovementioned reasons are in explaining different findings in the literature. We found that government transfers are more detrimental to economic growth in developed countries compared to less-developed countries because such transfers can have a non-monotonic effect on growth. When government transfers are substantial, as they are in developed countries, they tend to reduce growth. We also found that the growth effects of government transfers are sensitive to the measurement of the transfers, i.e., studies that use unemployment benefits instead of social security tend to report a stronger negative growth effect. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Awaworyi Churchill, S.; Yew, S.L.",Econ.

Preferences and constraints: the value of economic games for studying human behaviour: The value of economic games,"As economic games have spread from experimental economics to other social sciences, so too have critiques of their usefulness for drawing inferences about the 'real world'. What these criticisms often miss is that games can be used to reveal individuals' private preferences in ways that observational and interview data cannot; furthermore, economic games can be designed such that they do provide insights into real-world behaviour. Here, we draw on our collective experience using economic games in field contexts to illustrate how researchers can strategically alter the framing or design of economic games to draw inferences about private-world or real-world preferences. A detailed case study from coastal Colombia provides an example of the subtleties of game design and how games can be combined fruitfully with self-report data. We close with a list of concrete recommendations for how to modify economic games to better match particular research questions and research contexts. © 2020 The Authors.","Pisor, A.C.; Gervais, M.M.; Purzycki, B.G.; Ross, C.T.",R.

Results suggested that effects of earlier prosocial behavior toward family and strangers were predictive of fewer problem behaviors 2 years later, while results for prosocial behavior toward friends were more mixed. Results also suggested depression predicted lower prosocial behavior toward family members and anxiety predicted higher prosocial behavior toward friends.

Bistable probabilities: A unified framework for studying rationality and irrationality in classical and quantum games,"This article presents a unified probabilistic framework that allows both rational and irrational decision-making to be theoretically investigated and simulated in classical and quantum games. Rational choice theory is a basic component of game-theoretic models, which assumes that a decision-maker chooses the best action according to their preferences. In this article, we define irrationality as a deviation from a rational choice. Bistable probabilities are proposed as a principled and straightforward means for modelling (ir)rational decision-making in games. Bistable variants of classical and quantum Prisoner’s Dilemma, Stag Hunt and Chicken are analysed in order to assess the effect of (ir)rationality on agent utility and Nash equilibria. It was found that up to three Nash equilibria exist for all three classical bistable games and maximal utility was attained when agents were rational. Up to three Nash equilibria exist for all three quantum bistable games; however, utility was shown to increase according to higher levels of agent irrationality. © 2020 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Ischaemic preconditioning during cardiac surgery: systematic review and meta-analysis of perioperative outcomes in randomised clinical trials,"Ischaemic preconditioning reduced arrhythmias, inotrope requirements and critical-care stay following cardiac surgery and may have provided additional myocardial protection over cardioplegia alone. Further research was needed to determine the role of ischaemic preconditioning with any certainty. XCM: The inclusion criteria in terms of participants, intervention and study design were clearly stated. A number of relevant sources were searched, including a search for unpublished studies, which should have reduced the likelihood of publication bias. There was no mention of whether language restrictions were applied or not, so the likelihood of language bias was unknown. The authors' test suggested that some bias was present. Although study selection was performed in a way that would reduce reviewer bias and error, there were no details of how data were extracted or quality assessed and it was not possible to comment on the methods. Quality was assessed using a scoring system. This is not considered to be the best method. The details of results for individual studies were presented in tables, but no figures that detailed the included studies in the meta-analyses were presented. It was not possible to assess whether studies should have been combined or which studies may have contributed to heterogeneity identified. All the included studies were small and their quality was low. The authors' conclusions (which included the recognition of the need for further research) are, therefore, suitably conservative.

"Effects of Prosocial, Neutral, and Violent Video Games on Children's Helpful and Hurtful Behaviors","Recent research reveals that playing prosocial video games increases prosocial cognitions, positive affect, and helpful behaviors [Gentile et al., 2009; Greitemeyer and Osswald, 2009, 2010, 2011]. These results are consistent with the social-cognitive models of social behavior such as the general learning model [Buckley and Anderson, 2006]. However, no experimental studies have examined such effects on children. Previous research on violent video games suggests that short-term effects of video games are largely based on priming of existing behavioral scripts. Thus, it is unclear whether younger children will show similar effects. This research had 9-14 years olds play a prosocial, neutral, or violent video game, and assessed helpful and hurtful behaviors simultaneously through a new tangram measure. Prosocial games increased helpful and decreased hurtful behavior, whereas violent games had the opposite effects. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Saleem, M.; Anderson, C.A.; Gentile, D.A.",Aggress.

Moral decision-making as compared to economic and shopping contexts. Gender effects and utilitarianism,"�Abstract How do people make decisions? Previous psychological research consistently shed light on the fact that decisions are not the result of a pure rational reasoning, and that emotions can assume a crucial role. This is particularly true in the case of moral decision-making, which requires a complex integration of affective and cognitive processes. One question that is still open to debate concern the individual factors that can affect moral decisions. Gender has been consistently identified as a possible variable of interest for the adoption of different strategic behaviors, with men using more rational processes and women more deontological principles. In the present study we aimed at exploring the presence of gender differences in different decision-making scenarios. Results showed that the moral scenario led to a similar acceptance rate in both genders, while economic and shopping offers were more likely to be accepted by men. Also, women were more inclined to refuse unfair offers, which included a higher personal benefit at the expense of the opponent, even if this meant a total loss for both parties. Finally, correlational analyses revealed a different relation between risk propensity and decision-making in men and women in different scenarios. © 2019, Mimesis Edizioni.

The relationship between public subsidies and unearned revenues for non-profit organizations: Testing the crowding-out and crowding-in positions in the Czech Republic,"Due to their heavy dependence on financial support from the public sector and close links to a wide range of government policies, non-profit organisations (NPOs) are becoming increasingly state-oriented. Although economic experts have striven to empirically test whether public funding of the non-profit sector (NPS) supports private philanthropy or, on the contrary, crowds-it out, there is no comprehensive research of this type within the Czech Republic. In connection with these blank areas in theories on the Czech non-profit sector, we pose the following question: How does public financing of NPOs influence the amount of private donations that these organisations receive? To answer this question, we conducted our own research (n = 483). The results demonstrate a crowding-out effect for public resources but not for other types of financing sources, such as revenues from the organisation's own activity and commercial revenues.","Hladká, M.; Hyánek, V.; Špalek, J.",Ekon.

Crowding-out voluntary constributions to public goods,"We test the null hypothesis that involuntary transfers for the provision of a public good will completely crowd-out voluntary transfers against a warm-glow hypothesis that crowding-out will be incomplete because individuals care about giving. Our design extends existing work by considering two levels of the involuntary transfer and by using a design in which all subjects see all transfer treatments. We analyse the data with careful attention to boundary effects. The data reject the null hypothesis of complete crowding-out of voluntary transfers over the range of involuntary transfers considered, but suggest that crowding-out increases as the involuntary transfer increases and sufficiently large involuntary transfers may offset the benefits of warm-glow giving. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Altruism as hedonism: A social development perspective on the relationship of negative mood state and helping,"Attempted to reconcile the conflicting data on the relationship of negative mood state to altruism. Whereas some studies have shown that negative mood leads to increases in altruistic action, others have shown the reverse. It was hypothesized that the inconsistency of these results was due to differences in the ages and consequent levels of socialization of the Ss employed in the earlier studies. In order to test the hypothesis, a total of 100 Ss from 3 age groups (6-8, 10-12, and 15-18 yrs) were asked to think of either depressing or neutral events and were subsequently given the opportunity to be privately generous. Consistent with predictions from the negative state relief model of altruism, the youngest, least socialized Ss were somewhat less generous in the negative mood condition, but this relationship progressively reversed itself until in the oldest, most socialized group, the negative mood Ss were significantly more generous than neutral mood controls. Data support a hedonistic conception of altruism that views adult benevolence as self-gratification. It is suggested that the reward character of benevolence derives from the socialization experience.

Playing Prosocial Video Games Increases Empathy and Decreases Schadenfreude,"Past research provided abundant evidence that exposure to violent video games increases aggressive tendencies and decreases prosocial tendencies. In contrast, research on the effects of exposure to prosocial video games has been relatively sparse. The present research found support for the hypothesis that exposure to prosocial video games is positively related to prosocial affect and negatively related to antisocial affect. More specifically, two studies revealed that playing a prosocial (relative to a neutral) video game increased interpersonal empathy and decreased reported pleasure at another's misfortune (i.e., schadenfreude).

The female presence in different organisational positions and performance in secondary schools: Does a woman leader function as mediator?,"This study examines the relationship between female representation in different organisational positions and performance using a sample of Spanish secondary schools. These organizations have been usually depicted as ‘feminised environments’ although women in managerial positions are still underrepresented. Based on different theoretical approaches, we separately investigate the relationship between a greater female presence and school performance in three positions: a) as principal; b) on the management team; and c) as teachers. We also investigate if having a female leader exerts a significant mediator role on the relationship between greater female representation on the management team and teachers, respectively, and school performance. Our results reveal a positive and significant relationship between having a woman principal or a greater proportion of women teachers and school performance. However, the relationship between a high proportion of women on the management team and school performance is negative. We also find that a female principal does not play a significant role as mediator in the relationship between having a greater proportion of women on the management team and as teachers and school performance. © 2019 Campos-García, Zúñiga-Vicente.

African-Americans and Latinos are less likely to contribute to the environment, although conditional on giving, Latinos give more. Retired persons and households with children are less likely to contribute to the environment. Larger households give less to the environment.

Mental accounting and other-regarding behavior: Evidence from the lab,"This paper uncovers a key determinant of the other-regarding behavior that permeates bargaining experiments. Examining a one-shot dictator game that has the first-mover dictate the split of an amount of money, dictators acting over earned money exhibited self-interested behavior in 76% of bargains. This result stands in stark contrast to the baseline experiment in which dictators acting over allocated money displayed self-interested behavior in only 26% of bargains. Self-interested behavior appeared at greater levels using an earnings protocol than any previous variation of the dictator game. While the distinction between earned and unearned wealth is likely context specific, the earnings protocol may be an important option for future laboratory research. Specifically, the earnings protocol may provide a closer correspondence between the laboratory and individual choices over personal assets. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.","Cherry, T.L.",J. Econ.

I know you can see me: Social attention influences bodily self-awareness,"It has recently been demonstrated that eye contact influences bodily self-awareness. Here, we investigated if the belief of being the target of another person's attention may also induce such influence. We created videos of an individual wearing two different pairs of sunglasses. We manipulated the participants to believe that they were in on-line connection with the individual and that one of the pairs of sunglasses was obstructed so that the individual could not see them through it. We demonstrated that the perception of an individual wearing see-through sunglasses, as compared to obstructed sunglasses or a low-level baseline condition, led to a greater correlation between the participants’ rating of the intensity of their bodily reactions and their skin conductance response to emotional pictures. This shows that the belief to be watched by another social agent increases bodily self-awareness and further suggests that such belief is embedded in direct gaze perception. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Hazem, N.; George, N.; Baltazar, M.; Conty, L.",Biol.

A systematic review of motor and cognitive outcomes after early surgery for congenital heart disease,"CONTEXT: Brain injury is the most common long-term complication of congenital heart disease requiring surgery during infancy. It is clear that the youngest patients undergoing cardiac surgery, primarily neonates and young infants, are at the greatest risk for brain injury. Developmental anomalies sustained early in life have lifelong repercussions. OBJECTIVE: We conducted a systematic review to examine longitudinal studies of cognitive and/or motor outcome after cardiac surgery during early infancy. METHODS: Electronic searches were performed in Medline, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (Cinahl), and Embase (1998-2008). The search strategy yielded 327 articles, of which 65 were reviewed. Eight cohorts provided prospective data regarding the cognitive and/or motor outcome of infants who had undergone surgery for congenital heart disease before 6 months of age. Two authors, Ms Snookes and Dr Gunn, independently extracted data and presented results according to 3 subgroups for age of follow-up: early development (1 to 5 to 17 years). Weighted analysis was undertaken to pool the results of studies when appropriate. RESULTS: All of the identified studies reported results of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development for children younger than the age of 3. Outcome data as reported by the Bayley Scales were combined for infants assessed at 1 year of age, revealing a weighted mean Mental Development Index of 90.3 (95% confidence interval: 88.9-91.6) and Psychomotor Development Index of 78.1 (95% confidence interval: 76.4-79.7). Additional analysis was limited by a lack of data at preschool and school age. CONCLUSIONS: With this review we identified a limited number of prospective studies that systematically addressed outcome in patients at the highest risk. These studies consistently revealed cognitive and motor delay in children after cardiac surgery during early infancy. Additional investigation is required to ascertain the consequences of such impairment during later childhood and into adult life.","Snookes, Suzanne H; Gunn, Julia K; Eldridge, Bev J; Donath, Susan M; Hunt, Rod W; Galea, Mary P; Shekerdemian, Lara",Pediatrics,1485
Dependency as a Social Cue: A Meta-Analytic Review of Research on the Dependency–Helping Relationship,"A meta-analysis of experiments assessing the dependency-helping relationship revealed that across all studies in this area, increased victim dependency is associated with increased willingness to help on the part of others. The dependency-helping relationship is stronger for male victims than for female victims, although subject gender does not appear to mediate the dependency-helping relationship. Several methodological and situational variables mediate the dependency-helping relationship, including type of helping measure used, type of dependency manipulation employed, whether or not observers were present, degree of contact between subject and victim, and setting in which the study was conducted. The implications of these findings for theoretical models of the dependency-helping relationship are discussed. In addition, these findings are discussed with respect to studies that conceptualize dependency as an individual difference variable rather than as a social cue.

Randomized controlled trials of aprotinin in cardiac surgery: could clinical equipoise have stopped the bleeding?,"BACKGROUND: Aprotinin is a serine protease inhibitor used to limit perioperative bleeding and reduce the need for donated blood transfusions during cardiac surgery. Randomized controlled trials of aprotinin evaluating its effect on the outcome of perioperative transfusion have been published since 1987, and systematic reviews were conducted in 1992 and 1997. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted for all RCTs of aprotinin that used placebo controls or were open-label with no active control treatment. Data collected included the primary outcome, objective of each study, whether a systematic review was cited or conducted as part of the background and/or rationale for the study and the number of previously published RCTs cited. Cumulative meta-analyses were performed. RESULTS: Sixty-four randomized, controlled trials of aprotinin were found, conducted between 1987 and 2002, reporting an endpoint of perioperative transfusion. Median trial size was 64 subjects, with a range of 20 to 1784. A cumulative meta-analysis indicated that aprotinin greatly decreased the need for perioperative transfusion, stabilizing at an odds ratio of 0.25 (p < 10 - 6) by the 12th study, published in June of 1992. The upper limit of the confidence interval never exceeded 0.65 and results were similar in all subgroups. Citation of previous RCTs was extremely low, with a median of 20% of prior trials cited. Only 7 of 44 (15%) of subsequent reports referenced the largest trial (N = 1784), which was 28 times larger than the median trial size. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that investigators evaluating aprotinin were not adequately citing previous research, resulting in a large number of RCTs being conducted to address efficacy questions that prior trials had already definitively answered. Institutional review boards and journals could reduce the number of redundant trials by requiring investigators to conduct adequate searches for prior evidence and conducting systematic reviews.","Fergusson, Dean; Glass, Kathleen Cranley; Hutton, Brian; Shapiro, Stan",Clin.

Impure altruism in dictators' giving,"We design an experiment to test whether incomplete crowding out in dictator games can be rationalized by the impurely altruistic preferences.

Giving in dictator games: Regard for others or regard by others?,"Recent bargaining experiments demonstrate an effect of anonymity and incomplete information on behavior. This has rekindled the question whether ""fair"" behavior is inspired by regard for others or driven by external forces. To test this, we compare a dictator game treatment that provides receivers with information about the source of offers with one that does not, controlling for anonymity in a double-blind setting. Combined with extant results, our findings suggest that about half of dictator giving observed in experiments is internally motivated, and the other half is driven by external factors, such as experimenter observability or regard by receivers.","Koch, A.K.; Normann, H.-T.",South.

Saving the masses: The impact of perceived efficacy on charitable giving to single vs. multiple beneficiaries,"People are more generous toward single than toward multiple beneficiaries, and encouraging greater giving to multiple targets is challenging. We identify one factor, perceived efficacy, which enhances generosity toward multiple beneficiaries. We investigate relationships between perceived self-efficacy (believing one can take steps to make an impact), response efficacy (believing those steps will be effective), and charitable giving. Four studies show that increasing perceived self-efficacy increases perceived response efficacy (Studies 1 and 2) and increases donations for multiple beneficiaries (Studies 1-4). Further, results show that boosting perceived self-efficacy enhances giving to a greater extent for multiple than for single beneficiaries (Studies 3 and 4). These effects emerge using various charitable giving contexts, efficacy manipulations, and measures of generosity. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Sharma, E.; Morwitz, V.G.",Organ. Behav. Hum. Decis.

"Bias in meta-analysis detected by a simple, graphical test","Objective: Funnel plots (plots of effect estimates against sample size) may be useful to detect bias in meta-analyses that were later contradicted by large trials. We examined whether a simple test of asymmetry of funnel plots predicts discordance of results when meta-analyses are compared to large trials, and we assessed the prevalence of bias in published meta-analyses. Design: Medline search to identify pairs consisting of a meta-analysis and a single large trial (concordance of results was assumed if effects were in the same direction and the meta-analytic estimate was within 30% of the trial); analysis of funnel plots from 37 meta-analyses identified from a hand search of four leading general medicine journals 1993-6 and 38 meta-analyses from the second 1996 issue of the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Main outcome measure: Degree of funnel plot asymmetry as measured by the intercept from regression of standard normal deviates against precision. Results: In the eight pairs of meta-analysis and large trial that were identified (five from cardiovascular medicine, one from diabetic medicine, one from geriatric medicine, one from perinatal medicine) there were four concordant and four discordant pairs. In all cases discordance was due to meta-analyses showing larger effects. Funnel plot asymmetry was present in three out of four discordant pairs but in none of concordant pairs. In 14 (38%) journal meta-analyses and 5 (13%) Cochrane reviews, funnel plot asymmetry indicated that there was bias. Conclusions: A simple analysis of funnel plots provides a useful test for the likely presence of bias in meta-analyses, but as the capacity to detect bias will be limited when meta-analyses are based on a limited number of small trials the results from such analyses should be treated with considerable caution.","Egger, M.; Smith, G.D.; Schneider, M.; Minder, C.",BR.

Reputation spillover effects from grant-providing institutions,"There is a broad academic discussion about the impact of funding grants from a foundation or a government department on individual support intentions toward the nonprofit organization receiving the grant. However, the role of the grant provider's reputation has frequently been overlooked. In this study, we experimentally tested whether there is a reputation spillover effect of a grant-providing organization. Based on a real-life example, we asked citizens to rate their willingness to donate to a nonprofit organization, and we experimentally manipulated the available information on funding sources. We test this for both a government department and a foundation as a grant provider. Our results suggest that not the act of receiving a grant, but the citizens' awareness about the funding organization—at least in the case of a foundation—has an impact on support intentions. In contrast, for a prominent government department as a grant provider, we did not find support for a reputation spillover effect. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Willems, J.; Waldner, C.J.; Vogel, D.",Nonprofit Manage.

Intergenerational association of environmental concern: Evidence of parents’ and children's concern,"To understand how young people develop environmental concern, this article investigates the relationship between parents’ environmental concern and those of their children. Using 2006 survey data from the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), featuring nationally representative samples from 16 countries, this study provides evidence that parents’ environmental concern has an important influence on children's environmental concern. The influence of parents in this realm reflects the parent equivalent socialization hypothesis and applies for both boys and girls. However, girls are more sensitive to the intergenerational association of their mothers and fathers. Informative campaigns about the environment in schools also contribute to increase children's environmental concern. These results offer interesting implications for both research and practice. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Casaló, L.V.; Escario, J.-J.",J. Environ. Psychol.,1494

Conducting the review as a qualitative longitudinal study highlighted changes over time, and extraction of citation-related data facilitated an analysis of the interaction in this field. It was found that lack of 'communication' between researchers contributes to information being 'lost' and then later 'rediscovered'. It is recommended that researchers should plan early for dissemination and practice improvement to ensure that research contributes to change.","Dicks, Sean G; Ranse, Kristen; Northam, Holly; van Haren, Frank Mp; Boer, Douglas P",Health Psychol Open,1495

Policy and choice : Public finance through the lens of behavioral economics,"Traditional public finance provides a powerful framework for policy analysis, but it relies on a model of human behavior that the new science of behavioral economics increasingly calls into question. In Policy and Choice economists William Congdon, Jeffrey Kling, and Sendhil Mullainathan argue that public finance not only can incorporate many lessons of behavioral economics but also can serve as a solid foundation from which to apply insights from psychology to questions of economic policy. The authors revisit the core questions of public finance, armed with a richer perspective on human behavior. They do not merely apply findings from psychology to specific economic problems; instead, they explore how psychological factors actually reshape core concepts in public finance such as moral hazard, deadweight loss, and incentives. Part one sets the stage for integrating behavioral economics into public finance by interpreting the evidence from psychology and developing a framework for applying it to questions in public finance. In part two, the authors apply that framework to specific topics in public finance, including social insurance, externalities and public goods, income support and redistribution, and taxation. In doing so, the authors build a unified analytical approach that encompasses both traditional policy levers, such as taxes and subsidies, and more psychologically informed instruments. The net result of this innovative approach is a fully behavioral public finance, an integration of psychology and the economics of the public sector that is explicit, systematic, rigorous, and realistic.

Upstream reciprocity and the evolution of gratitude,"If someone is nice to you, you feel good and may be inclined to be nice to somebody else. This every day experience is borne out by experimental games: the recipients of an act of kindness are more likely to help in turn, even if the person who benefits from their generosity is somebody else. This behaviour, which has been called 'upstream reciprocity', appears to be a misdirected act of gratitude: you help somebody because somebody else has helped you. Does this make any sense from an evolutionary or a game theoretic perspective? In this paper, we show that upstream reciprocity alone does not lead to the evolution of cooperation, but it can evolve and increase the level of cooperation if it is linked to either direct or spatial reciprocity. We calculate the random walks of altruistic acts that are induced by upstream reciprocity. Our analysis shows that gratitude and other positive emotions, which increase the willingness to help others, can evolve in the competitive world of natural selection. © 2006 The Royal Society.","Nowak, M.A.; Roch, S.",Proc.

Sharing one's fortune? An experimental study on earned income and giving,"In this paper, we investigate the relationship between earnings and charitable giving, in an environment in which earnings depend on luck but not in a manner that makes its contribution obvious. We set up a real effort experiment, in which subjects enter data in four one-hour occasions and are paid a piece rate. From the second occasion onwards, we randomly assign half of the subjects to a treatment with higher piece rates, without the subjects being explicitly made aware of the random assignment into the two groups. At the end we ask subjects whether they want to donate a share of their earnings to a charity of their choice. We find that, despite large differences in earnings due to the different piece rates, subjects receiving the higher piece rate are actually less likely to give, and that givers in the two groups give the same share of their total earnings. Charities receive the same average donation from members of the two groups, indicating that charitable giving by subjects in this experiment does not increase with income. We discuss how these results can be explained by self-serving attribution bias. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Tonin, M.; Vlassopoulos, M.",J. Behave. Exp. Econ.,1499
Understanding amygdala responsiveness to fearful expressions through the lens of psychopathy and altruism,"Because the face is the central focus of human social interactions, emotional facial expressions provide a unique window into the emotional lives of others. They play a particularly important role in fostering empathy, which entails understanding and responding to others' emotions, especially distress-related emotions such as fear. This Review considers how fearful facial as well as vocal and postural expressions are interpreted, with an emphasis on the role of the amygdala. The amygdala may be best known for its role in the acquisition and expression of conditioned fear, but it also supports the perception and recognition of others' fear. Various explanations have been supplied for the amygdala's role in interpreting and responding to fearful expressions. They include theories that amygdala responses to fearful expressions 1) reflect heightened vigilance in response to uncertain danger, 2) promote heightened attention to the eye region of faces, 3) represent a response to an unconditioned aversive stimulus, or 4) reflect the generation of an empathic fear response. Among these, only empathic fear explains why amygdala lesions would impair fear recognition across modalities. Supporting the possibility of a link between fundamental empathic processes and amygdala responses to fear is evidence that impaired fear recognition in psychopathic individuals results from amygdala dysfunction, whereas enhanced fear recognition in altruistic individuals results from enhanced amygdala function. Empathic concern and caring behaviors may be fostered by sensitivity to signs of acute distress in others, which relies on intact functioning of the amygdala.","Marsh, Abigail A",J. Neurosci.

Stake size effects in ultimatum game and dictator game offers: A meta-analysis,"Are people more generous when less money is at stake? The Ultimatum Game (UG) and Dictator Game (DG) are often used as models of bargaining and charitable giving, respectively. Previous studies have produced conflicting results on whether UG and DG offers are lower when the stakes are high, and many previous studies had insufficient statistical power to detect significant effects of stake size. To resolve this, we conducted a meta-analysis of 31 existing studies that manipulated the size of participants’ endowments in the UG and DG (3233 total participants). We hypothesized that: (1) proposer offers would be lower with larger stakes in both games, owing to an increased cost of giving; and (2) offers would decrease more with stake size in the DG than the UG because proposers would not want to risk their offer being rejected in the UG. Our results found almost zero effect of stake size on UG offers (d = 0.02), and a small but significant effect of stake size on DG offers (d = 0.15). Furthermore, larger differences in stakes had little impact on the effect sizes in the UG, but had a medium-large impact on the effect sizes in the DG. These results show that higher stakes reduce donations in the DG, albeit not by much, and have little to no effect in the UG.

Knowledge sharing and absorptive capacity: interdependency and complementarity,"Purpose: This study aims to resolve contradictions in the literature regarding the relationship between knowledge sharing (KS) and absorptive capacity (AC). The authors analyze the reasons for which KS has been interpreted as an antecedent and those for which it has been seen as a consequent of AC. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses a systematic review of the literature to identify the arguments supporting the relationships between the constructs and propose a model. Additionally, the hypotheses were tested using SEM to assess the proposed model. Findings: The findings reveal the nature of the relationship between KS and AC. Suggesting AC is bi-dimensional, consisting of potential AC and realized AC, while the relationship between these two dimensions depends on KS. Research limitations/implications: This study provides consistent theoretical grounds for future empirical research. The study findings demonstrate KS provides a real contribution towards AC, validating the previous literature on the impact of KS antecedents on realized AC. Additionally, the authors provide evidence to suggest knowledge donation is an output of the AC process, thus generating a debate on the nature of knowledge donation (requested vs unrequested), which raises interesting research questions to be addressed in the future. As a limitation, empirical data was only collected in the context of software development in two countries. Practical implications: The results elucidate the central role of knowledge collection within AC. For managers, the importance of the role of knowledge collection to fully benefit from AC and exploit knowledge is highlighted. Originality/value: The research design is original in that it combines a systematic and integrative literature review to the ground and propose hypotheses with empirically testing of the emerging model. The study clarifies the relationship between KS and AC, providing evidence to show knowledge donation is an output of the AC process. The benefits of this study can be seen at the team and firm-level. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Balle, A.R.; Oliveira, M.; Curado, C.M.M.",J. Knowl. Manag.,1503

Is having sex with other men a risk factor for transfusion-transmissible infections in male blood donors in Western countries? A systematic review,"BACKGROUND: Although increased prevalence of transfusion transmissible infections (TTI) among ""men who have sex with men"" (MSM) has been well documented, the exclusion of MSM as blood donors is contested. The aim of this systematic review is to find studies that describe the risk of TTI in MSM blood donors. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cinahl, and Web of Science, and used GRADE for determining evidence quality. We included studies comparing MSM and non-MSM blood donors (or people eligible to give blood), living in areas most relevant for our Blood Service. RESULTS: Out of 18 987 articles, 14 observational studies were included. Two studies directly compared MSM with non-MSM donors showing that MSM donors have a statistically significant higher risk of HIV-1 infections. In one of these studies it was shown that this was related to recent (< 12 months) MSM contact. In two additional studies no evidence was shown in favour of a certain deferral period for MSM. Ten studies, applying permanent deferral for MSM, compared infected versus non-infected donors. One study found that MSM is a statistically significant risk factor for HIV-1 infection in blood donors. For other TTI such as HBV or HCV, an increased risk of infection could not be demonstrated, because the precision of the results was affected by the low numbers of donors with MSM as risk factor, or because of risk of bias in the included studies. All studies included low level evidence, because of risk of bias and imprecision of the results. CONCLUSIONS: High-quality studies investigating the risk of TTI in MSM who donate blood are scarce. The available evidence suggests a link between MSM blood donors and HIV-1 infection, but is too limited to be able to unambiguously/clearly recommend a certain deferral policy.","De Buck, Emmy; Dieltjens, Tessa; Compernolle, Veerle; Vandekerckhove, Philippe",PLoS One,1505
Interventions for promoting habitual exercise in people living with and beyond cancer,"BACKGROUND: The beneficial effects of regular exercise for people living with or beyond cancer are becoming apparent. However, how to promote exercise behaviour in sedentary cancer cohorts is not as well understood. A large majority of people living with or recovering from cancer do not meet exercise recommendations. Hence, reviewing the evidence on how to promote and sustain exercise behaviour is important. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of interventions to promote exercise behaviour in sedentary people living with and beyond cancer and to address the following questions: Which interventions are most effective in improving aerobic fitness and skeletal muscle strength and endurance? What adverse effects are attributed to different exercise interventions? Which interventions are most effective in improving exercise behaviour amongst patients with different cancers? Which interventions are most likely to promote long-term (12 months or longer) exercise behaviour? What frequency of contact with exercise professionals is associated with increased exercise behaviour? What theoretical basis is most often associated with increased exercise behaviour? What behaviour change techniques are most often associated with increased exercise behaviour? SEARCH METHODS: We searched the following electronic databases: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 8, 2012), MEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED, CINAHL, PsycLIT/PsycINFO, SportDiscus and PEDro from inception to August 2012. We also searched the grey literature, wrote to leading experts in the field, wrote to charities and searched reference lists of other recent systematic reviews. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared an exercise intervention with a usual care approach in sedentary people over the age of 18 with a homogenous primary cancer diagnosis. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors working independently (LB and KH) screened all titles and abstracts to identify studies that might meet the inclusion criteria, or that cannot be safely excluded without assessment of the full text (e.g. when no abstract is available). All eligible papers were formally abstracted by at least two members of the review author team working independently (LB and KH) and using the data collection form. When possible, and if appropriate, we performed a fixed-effect meta-analysis of study outcomes. For continuous outcomes (e.g. cardiorespiratory fitness), we extracted the final value, the standard deviation of the outcome of interest and the number of participants assessed at follow-up in each treatment arm, to estimate standardised mean difference (SMD) between treatment arms. SMD was used, as investigators used heterogeneous methods to assess individual outcomes. If a meta-analysis was not possible or was not appropriate, we synthesised studies as a narrative. MAIN RESULTS: Fourteen trials were included in this review, involving a total of 648 participants. Only studies involving breast, prostate or colorectal cancer were identified as eligible. Just six trials incorporated a target level of exercise that could meet current recommendations. Only three trials were identified that attempted to objectively validate independent exercise behaviour with accelerometers or heart rate monitoring. Adherence to exercise interventions, which is crucial for understanding treatment dose, is often poorly reported. It is important to note that the fundamental metrics of exercise behaviour (i.e. frequency, intensity and duration, repetitions, sets and intensity of resistance training), although easy to devise and report, are seldom included in published clinical trials.None of the included trials reported that 75% or greater adherence (the stated primary outcome for this review) of the intervention group met current aerobic exercise recommendations at any given follow-up. Just two trials reported six weeks of resistance exercise behaviour that would meet the guideline recommendations. However, three trials reported adherence of 75% or greater to an aerobic exercise goal that was less than the current guideline recommendation of 150 minutes per week. All three incorporated both supervised and independent exercise components as part of the intervention, and none placed restrictions on the control group in terms of exercise behaviour. These three trials shared programme set goals and the following behaviour change techniques: generalisation of a target behaviour; prompting of self-monitoring of behaviour; and prompting of practise. Despite the uncertainty surrounding adherence in many of the included trials, interventions caused improvements in aerobic exercise tolerance at 8 to 12 weeks (from 7 studies, SMD 0.73, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.51 to 0.95) in intervention participants compared with controls. At six months, aerobic exercise tolerance was also improved (from 5 studies, SMD 0.70, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.94), but it should be noted that four of the five trials used in this analysis had a high risk of bias, hence caution is warranted in interpretation of results. Attrition over the course of these interventions is typically low (median 6%). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Interventions to promote exercise in cancer survivors who report better levels of adherence share some common behaviour change techniques. These involve setting programme goals, prompting practise and self-monitoring and encouraging participants to attempt to generalise behaviours learned in supervised exercise environments to other, non-supervised contexts. However, expecting most sedentary survivors to achieve current guideline recommendations of at least 150 minutes per week of aerobic exercise is likely to be unrealistic. As with all well-designed exercise programmes in any context, prescriptions should be designed around individual capabilities, and frequency, duration and intensity or sets, repetitions, intensity or resistance training should be generated on this basis.","Bourke, Liam; Homer, Kate E; Thaha, Mohamed A; Steed, Liz; Rosario, Derek J; Robb, Karen A; Saxton, John M; Taylor, Stephanie J C",Cochrane Database Syst.

Divine intuition: Cognitive style influences belief in God,"Some have argued that belief in God is intuitive, a natural (by-)product of the human mind given its cognitive structure and social context. If this is true, the extent to which one believes in God may be influenced by one's more general tendency to rely on intuition versus reflection. Three studies support this hypothesis, linking intuitive cognitive style to belief in God. Study 1 showed that individual differences in cognitive style predict belief in God. Participants completed the Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT; Frederick, 2005), which employs math problems that, although easily solvable, have intuitively compelling incorrect answers. Participants who gave more intuitive answers on the CRT reported stronger belief in God. This effect was not mediated by education level, income, political orientation, or other demographic variables. Study 2 showed that the correlation between CRT scores and belief in God also holds when cognitive ability (IQ) and aspects of personality were controlled. Moreover, both studies demonstrated that intuitive CRT responses predicted the degree to which individuals reported having strengthened their belief in God since childhood, but not their familial religiosity during childhood, suggesting a causal relationship between cognitive style and change in belief over time. Study 3 revealed such a causal relationship over the short term: Experimentally inducing a mindset that favors intuition over reflection increases self-reported belief in God. © 2011 American Psychological Association.","Shenhav, A.; Rand, D.G.; Greene, J.D.",J.

Violence against children in humanitarian settings: A literature review of population-based approaches,"Children in humanitarian settings are thought to experience increased exposure to violence, which can impair their physical, emotional, and social development. Violence against children has important economic and social consequences for nations as a whole. The purpose of this review is to examine population-based approaches measuring violence against children in humanitarian settings. The authors reviewed prevalence studies of violence against children in humanitarian contexts appearing in peer-reviewed journals within the past twenty years. A Boolean search procedure was conducted in October 2014 of the electronic databases PubMed/Medline and PsychInfo. If abstracts contained evidence of the study's four primary themes--violence, children, humanitarian contexts and population-based measurement--a full document review was undertaken to confirm relevance. Out of 2634 identified articles, 22 met the final inclusion criteria. Across studies, there was varying quality and no standardization in measurement approach. Nine out of 22 studies demonstrated a relationship between conflict exposure and adverse health or mental health outcomes. Among studies that compared rates of violence between boys and girls, boys reported higher rates of physical violence, while girls reported higher rates of sexual violence. Children in infancy and early childhood were found to be among the most under-researched. Ultimately, the body of evidence in this review offers an incomplete picture regarding the prevalence, nature and impact of violence against children in emergencies, demonstrating a weak evidence base for some of the basic assumptions underpinning humanitarian practice. The development of standardized approaches to more rigorously measure violence against children is urgently needed in order to understand trends of violence against children in humanitarian contexts, and to promote children's healthy development and well-being.","Stark, Lindsay; Landis, Debbie",Soc.

Political engagement and the internet in the 2008 U.S. presidential elections: A panel survey,"Introduction In the run-up to the 2008 U.S. presidential election, the media buzz about online mobilization was palpable. Expectations were set high. Following in the footsteps of Howard Dean in the 2004 presidential election, President Barack Obama raised $600 million, much of it from small online donations by individuals (Luo 2008). Without question, the internet is an integral part of politics in the twenty-first century, as America quickly has become a nation of digital citizens (Mossberger, Tolbert, and McNeal 2008) residing in a digital public sphere (Howard 2005). During the 2008 presidential election, 55 percent of the U.S. adult population used the internet for some type of political activity, ranging from looking up information on candidates to reading political blogs, watching YouTube videos, and using candidates’ websites (Smith 2009). There is a growing body of research demonstrating that internet use can increase political participation and is associated with higher levels of voting and participation in election campaigns (Bimber 2003; Tolbert and McNeal 2003; Krueger 2002, 2006; Mossberger etal. 2008). But is online politics engaging new participants, or is it only expanding activity among those who are already interested and active, as many scholars have found (Norris 1999b; Margolis and Resnick 2000; Prior 2005)? If the latter is the case, online politics may be increasing the gap between the informed and the uninformed. Most previous research has relied on cross-sectional survey data that do not allow us to measure how change in use of the internet for politics is associated with change in civic engagement and traditional political participation, such as voting over the course of a single campaign season. One recent study provides a meta-analysis of the current work on the internet's effect on engagement (Boulianne 2009). Results show that the internet's effect is nonnegative. However, the meta-analysis itself draws on studies using cross-sectional survey data. Using a unique six-wave panel survey from the 2008 U.S. presidential elections that includes a national sample of twenty thousand registered voters from before the presidential primaries through the general election, we measure who changed their level of online political engagement and how it affected political interest, as well as traditional (offline) political behavior and voter turnout. © Cambridge University Press 2012.","Hamilton, A; Tolbert, C J",Digital Media and Political Engagement Worldwide: A Comparative Study,1513

"A lot of action, but not in the right direction: systematic review and content analysis of smartphone applications for the prevention, detection, and management of cancer","BACKGROUND: Mobile phones have become nearly ubiquitous, offering a promising means to deliver health interventions. However, little is known about smartphone applications (apps) for cancer. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to characterize the purpose and content of cancer-focused smartphone apps available for use by the general public and the evidence on their utility or effectiveness. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of the official application stores for the four major smartphone platforms: iPhone, Android, Nokia, and BlackBerry. Apps were included in the review if they were focused on cancer and available for use by the general public. This was complemented by a systematic review of literature from MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library to identify evaluations of cancer-related smartphone apps. RESULTS: A total of 295 apps from the smartphone app stores met the inclusion criteria. The majority of apps targeted breast cancer (46.8%, 138/295) or cancer in general (28.5%, 84/295). The reported app purpose was predominantly to raise awareness about cancer (32.2%, 95/295) or to provide educational information about cancer (26.4%, 78/295), followed by apps to support fundraising efforts (12.9%, 38/295), assist in early detection (11.5%, 34/295), promote a charitable organization (10.2%, 30/295), support disease management (3.7%, 11/295), cancer prevention (2.0%, 6/295), or social support (1.0%, 3/295). The majority of the apps did not describe their organizational affiliation (64.1%, 189/295). Apps affiliated with non-profit organizations were more likely to be free of cost (χ(2) 1=16.3, P<.001) and have a fundraising or awareness purpose (χ(2) 2=13.3, P=.001). The review of the health literature yielded 594 articles, none of which reported an evaluation of a cancer-focused smartphone application. CONCLUSIONS: There are hundreds of cancer-focused apps with the potential to enhance efforts to promote behavior change, to monitor a host of symptoms and physiological indicators of disease, and to provide real-time supportive interventions, conveniently and at low cost. However, there is a lack of evidence on their utility, effectiveness, and safety. Future efforts should focus on improving and consolidating the evidence base into a whitelist for public consumption.","Bender, Jacqueline Lorene; Yue, Rossini Ying Kwan; To, Matthew Jason; Deacken, Laetitia; Jadad, Alejandro R",J.

Does Reported Policy Activity Reduce Contributions to Nonprofit Service Providers?,"There is a growing recognition that charitable organizations are important actors in the policy process, but research has not, to date, systematically investigated whether reporting policy activity influences private giving to such organizations. This article develops the argument that reported lobbying should be positively related to donations because organizations seeking policy change consider such activities to be vital to their clients and missions and communicate that belief to potential donors. This article tests for the relationship between reported lobbying activities and private giving in analyses of 501(c)(3) organizations that filed Internal Revenue Service form 990s in fiscal years 2000 and 2001. The results suggest that organizations that report policy activity receive more donations in the following fiscal year, with some variation across service type. The article concludes with a discussion of the implications for the policy process and scholars of nonprofit organizations. © 2011 Policy Studies Organization.","Nicholson-Crotty, J.",Policy Stud.

Doppler-guided intra-operative fluid management during major abdominal surgery: systematic review and meta-analysis,"Doppler-guided fluid management may have improved outcomes in patients undergoing major abdominal surgery, but further research is required. XCM: The review question was clearly stated and inclusion criteria were appropriately defined. Several relevant sources were searched including conference proceedings. Although no evidence of publication bias was found, tests for publication bias may not be reliable due to the small number of trials. However, it was not clear if attempts were made to minimise language bias. Study validity was assessed but only aggregated scores were reported; this made it difficult to independently comment on the reliability of the evidence presented. Methods used to select studies, assess validity and extract data were not described, so it is not known whether efforts were made to reduce reviewer errors and bias. Little information was provided about participants, making it difficult to assess the generalisability of findings. Appropriate methods were used for the meta-analyses and heterogeneity was assessed. Some analyses involved a small number of events and there were differences between trials for some outcomes. The authors’ cautious conclusions appear to be supported by the evidence presented, but lack of reporting of review methods makes it difficult to assess their reliability. XIM: Practice: The authors stated that further research is required before Doppler-guided management can be recommended for routine use.Research: The authors stated that differences between trials in the review appear to justify the need for a large trial to evaluate Doppler-guided fluid management. Trials that directly compare Doppler-guided management with fluid restriction and economic analyses of Doppler-guided management are also required. However, the recommendation for economic analysis was not supported by the review since the review did not search for economic studies, so the need for such studies was not apparent.","Walsh, S R; Tang, T; Bass, S; Gaunt, M E",,1519
Using quantitative trait in adults with ADHD to test predictions of dual-process theory,"Dual-process theory is a widely utilized modelling tool in the behavioral sciences. It conceptualizes decision-making as an interaction between two types of cognitive processes, some of them fast and intuitive, others slow and reflective. We make a novel contribution to this literature by exploring differences between adults with clinically diagnosed ADHD and healthy controls for a wide range of behaviors. Given the clinical picture and nature of ADHD symptoms, we had a strong a priori reason to expect differences in intuitive vs reflective processing; and thus an unusually strong case for testing the predictions of dual-process theory. We found mixed results, with overall weaker effects than expected, except for risk taking, where individuals with ADHD showed increased domain sensitivity for gains vs losses. Some of our predictions were supported by the data but other patterns are more difficult to reconcile with theory. On balance, our results provide only limited empirical support for using dual-process theory to understand basic social and economic decision-making. © 2020, The Author(s).","Persson, E.; Heilig, M.; Tinghög, G.; Capusan, A.J.",Sci.

Systematic Review of the Effects of Chemical Insecticides on Four Common Butterfly Families,"Safeguarding crop productivity by protecting crops from pest attacks entails the wide use of plant protection products that provide a quick, easy and cheap solution. The objective of this study is to understand the effects of insecticides used in agriculture on non-target butterflies, specifically on the families Lycaenidae, Nymphalidae, Hesperiidae, and Papilionidae. To achieve this goal, a formal systematic review was performed according to European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) guidelines, by entering a combination of keywords on 3 online databases. Three reviewers independently extracted information on study characteristics and quality. The main results were collected and grouped by the insecticide used, butterflies species and family, and endpoints. The output was valuable but heterogeneous as the endpoints and methodologies of the studies reviewed were different. Few experimental studies on the effects of insecticides on the most common butterfly families have been published. Naled and permethrin are the most commonly used insecticides in the experiments, whilst the target organisms of these studies are Vanessa cardui, Danaus plexippus, Heliconius charitonius, belonging to the Nymphalidae family, and Eumaeus atala, belonging to the Lycaenidae family; the effects were evaluated on all developmental stages, with special attention to the larval phase. This systematic review highlights the need for more studies on the effects of chemical insecticides on non-target Lepidoptera in light of their ecological importance and the extensive use of these chemical products. © 2017 Mulé, Sabella, Robba and Manachini.","Mulé, Rosaria, Dr.; Sabella, Giorgio, Dr.; Robba, Lavinia, PhD; Manachini, Barbara, Ph.D Prof.",Front.

Government funding and fundraising: an online experiment of nonprofit leader preferences and personality,"Purpose: Many empirical studies have focused on whether public funding leverages (crowds in) or discourages (crowds out) private giving behavior, finding mixed results. Recent studies suggest the need to examine how nonprofits adjust their fundraising efforts after experiencing cuts or increases in government funding, which can then influence donor behavior. Design/methodology/approach: In this study, the authors conduct an online survey experiment with nonprofit managers to test how nonprofits respond to changes in government funding. Findings: The authors find some evidence that nonprofit organizations would change their fundraising expenses when facing cuts in government funding, yet the authors also find that the change could be either to increase or decrease fundraising spending. Since decisions are made by executive directors, the study also considered how executive personality type as maximizers or satisficers may interact with institutional and environmental constraints in decision-making. When funding goals are met, executives tend to behave as “satisficers” and are unlikely to make significant changes, even when their individual personality is more consistent with being a “maximizer.” Research limitations/implications: The authors find these results to be the reflection of the current environment in which many nonprofits operate, characterized by pressures to keep operating costs low. The results of the experiment have implications for both funding agencies and nonprofits that strive to enhance the capacity of nonprofit services. Originality/value: This study is the first attempt to untangle the multilayered relationships between government funding, fundraising, leader preferences and personalities, and donations using an experimental approach with current nonprofit leaders. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Kim, M.; Mason, D.P.",J.

"Are Shame, Guilt, and Embarrassment Distinct Emotions?","182 undergraduates described personal embarrassment, shame, and guilt experiences and rated these experiences on structural and phenomenological dimensions. Contrary to popular belief, shame was no more likely than guilt to be experienced in ""public"" situations; all 3 emotions typically occurred in social contexts, but a significant proportion of shame and guilt events occurred when respondents were alone. Analyses of participants' phenomenological ratings clearly demonstrated that shame, guilt, and embarrassment are not merely different terms for the same affective experience. In particular, embarrassment was a relatively distant neighbor of shame and guilt, and the differences among the 3 could not be explained simply by intensity of affect or by degree of moral transgression. Finally, participants generally were their own harshest critics in each type of event, evaluating themselves more negatively than they believed others did.","Tangney, J.P.; Miller, R.S.; Flicker, L.; Barlow, D.H.",J.

Individual differences in reasoning style as a moderator of the identifiable victim effect,"The identifiable victim effect refers to people's greater helpfulness towards personalized, single victims compared to aggregated, statistical victims. A field study tested recent claims that analytical processing might undermine support for identified victims by suppressing emotional responses (Small, Loewenstein, & Slovic, 2007). Individual differences in analytic (""rational"") processing style moderated the effects of different request types on donations to a Zambian relief fund. Less-analytic processors donated more to a single identified victim than to requests describing statistical victims or a combination of both; more-analytic processors showed no differences. Self-reported emotional responses, however, did not support an affect-mediated account of these effects. Use of proportional reasoning strategies is discussed as a possible alternative account of current and past findings. © 2010 Psychology Press.","Friedrich, J.; McGuire, A.",Soc. Influ.,1524
Corporate social responsibility at the micro-level as a “new organizational value” for sustainability: Are females more aligned towards it?,"While prior studies have largely addressed corporate social responsibility (CSR) at a macro or institutional level, its importance at the micro or individual level is to date underexplored, especially in the context of developing economies. Further, it is not clear from the studies in the extant literature how the role of females is more important in the context of environmental management as compared to males. Similarly, micro-level CSR (MCSR) is emerging as a “new organizational value”, and the organizations that acknowledge this “new organizational value” and incorporate it into their business operations are likely to achieve sustainability objectives far better as compared to their counterparts. The present study investigates the impact of MCSR on employees’ pro-environmental behavior with the moderating effect of gender in the healthcare sector of Pakistan. The data were collected from five large hospitals in the city of Lahore through a self-administered questionnaire and analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM) in AMOS software. A total of 533 out of 800 responses were received, which were used for data analysis of the present study. The results revealed that MCSR positively influences employee’s pro-environmental behavior, and gender moderates this relationship but the moderating effect of females is stronger as compared to males. The findings of the present study would help policymakers understand the importance of MCSR as a “new organizational value” to influence employees’ pro-environmental behavior with a special focus to promote the proactive role of females at workplaces. © 2021 by the authors.

Prevalence and trend of HIV infection among voluntary blood donors in China since implementation of the Blood Donation Law: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"OBJECTIVE: In 1998, the Blood Donation Law was enacted in China in response to the outbreak of HIV endemic in central rural China as a result of unhygienic and commercial blood collection. This study aims to provide a first comprehensive review of available data on the prevalence, trend and other epidemiological characteristics of HIV infection among voluntary blood donors since 1998. METHODS: Major English and Chinese databases were searched and a systematic review was constructed. Pooled infection rates by province and year were calculated using random-effect or fixed-effect models. RESULTS: A total of 87 studies met our inclusion criteria. A total of 2573 HIV-positive cases were identified among voluntary blood donors in the past 10 years; the pooled prevalence was 13.22/100,000, with a range of 0.74-125.97 per 100,000. Among the 24 provinces that reported yearly data, the prevalence of HIV increased from 5.62/100,000 to 28.90/100,000. The male-to-female ratio was 2.8; about 60% were below the age of 30 years. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of HIV in voluntary blood donors has risen steadily and fast. Efficient measures need to be taken urgently to prevent HIV test-seeking through blood donor programmes, to promote voluntary blood donation in low-risk groups and to enforce the Blood Donation Law strictly.","Hong, Yan; Huang, Xia; Ling, Hua; Liao, Hongwen",Trop.

Attractiveness qualifies the effect of observation on trusting behavior in an economic game,"Recent studies show that subtle cues of observation affect cooperation even when anonymity is explicitly assured. For instance, recent studies have shown that the presence of eyes increases cooperation on social economic tasks. Here, we tested the effects of cues of observation on trusting behavior in a two-player Trust game and the extent to which these effects are qualified by participants' own attractiveness. Although explicit cues of being observed (i.e., when participants were informed that the other player would see their face) tended to increase trusting behavior, this effect was qualified by the participants' other-rated attractiveness (estimated from third-party ratings of face photographs). Participants' own physical attractiveness was positively correlated with the extent to which they trusted others more when they believed they could be seen than when they believed they could not be seen. This interaction between cues of observation and own attractiveness suggests context dependence of trusting behavior that is sensitive to whether and how others react to one's physical appearance. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Affective motivations to help others: A two-stage model of donation decisions,"Emotional reactions are an important element in the motivation to help others. Our research examined the role of affective vs. deliberative information processing in the genesis and use of emotional reactions in decisions to provide financial aid to people in distress. In two studies, we investigated whether information processing mode influenced participants' donations, affective reactions, and the relationship between the two. Information processing was manipulated by a priming procedure and a cognitive load paradigm. Participants' empathic emotions were assessed by self-reported sympathy, compassion, and distress. Additionally, we measured how much better a donation would make participants feel and their anticipated regret for not donating, which were taken as indicators of their motivation to donate as a form of mood management. Results suggest that different mechanisms govern the initial decision to donate money (Stage 1) compared to later decisions on how much money to donate (Stage 2). Motivations for mood management were primarily predictive of donation decisions, whereas empathic feelings were predictive of the donation amount. The potentially disruptive effects of deliberative processing on prosocial behavior are discussed in light of a two-stage processing model of donations. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Dickert, S.; Sagara, N.; Slovic, P.",J.

Gender differences in lying in sender-receiver games: A meta-analysis,"Whether there are gender differences in lying has been largely debated in the past decade. Previous studies found mixed results. To shed light on this topic, here I report a meta-analysis of 8,728 distinct observations, collected in 65 Sender-Receiver game treatments, by 14 research groups. Following previous work and theoretical considerations, I distinguish three types of lies: black lies, which benefit the liar at a cost for another person; altruistic white lies, which benefit another person at a cost for the liar; and Pareto white lies, which benefit both the liar and another person. The results show that: males are significantly more likely than females to tell black lies (N=4,173); males are significantly more likely than females to tell altruistic white (N=2,940); and results are inconclusive in the case of Pareto white lies (N=1,615). Furthermore, gender differences in telling altruistic white lies are significantly stronger than in the other two cases. © 2018, Society for Judgment and Decision making.

“We aren’t idlers”: Using subjective group dynamics to promote prosocial driver behavior at long-wait stops,"Idling engines are a substantial air pollutant which contribute to many health and environmental problems. In this field experiment (N = 419) we use the subjective group dynamics framework to test ways of motivating car drivers to turn off idle engines at a long wait stop where the majority leave their engines idling. One of three normative messages (descriptive norm, in-group prescriptive deviance, outgroup prescriptive deviance) was displayed when barriers were down at a busy railway level-crossing. Compared to the baseline, normative messages increased the proportion of drivers that turned off their engines. Consistent with subjective group dynamics theory, the most effective approach was to highlight instances of in-group prescriptive deviance (47% stopped idling, compared with 28% in the baseline). Implications for health and environmental outcomes and future research are discussed. © 2018 The Authors.

Altruism toward in-group members as a reputation mechanism,"To test the hypothesis that sensitivity to monitoring drives people to act altruistically toward members of their own community, two experiments investigated whether an eye-like painting promotes altruism toward in-group members, but not toward out-group members. Participants played the role of dictator in a dictator game with another participant (a recipient) who was from the minimal in-group or out-group. Participants knew whether their recipient was an in-group member or an out-group member, but were informed that their recipient did not know the group membership of the dictator. In-group favoritism occurred only when participants were facing a computer desktop which displayed a painting of eyes, but did not occur in the absence of eyes. These findings demonstrate that the eye painting displayed on the participant's computer screen worked as a cue for monitoring and thus enhanced the participant's altruistic behavior. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Hypernatural monitoring: A social rehearsal account of smartphone addiction,"We present a deflationary account of smartphone addiction by situating this purportedly antisocial phenomenon within the fundamentally social dispositions of our species. While we agree with contemporary critics that the hyper-connectedness and unpredictable rewards of mobile technology can modulate negative affect, we propose to place the locus of addiction on an evolutionarily older mechanism: the human need to monitor and be monitored by others. Drawing from key findings in evolutionary anthropology and the cognitive science of religion, we articulate a hypernatural monitoring model of smartphone addiction grounded in a general social rehearsal theory of human cognition. Building on recent predictive-processing views of perception and addiction in cognitive neuroscience, we describe the role of social reward anticipation and prediction errors in mediating dysfunctional smartphone use. We conclude with insights from contemplative philosophies and harm-reduction models on finding the right rituals for honoring social connections and setting intentional protocols for the consumption of social information. © 2018 Veissière and Stendel.","Veissière, S.P.L.; Stendel, M.",Front.

Evaluating the impact of healthcare provider training to improve tuberculosis management: a systematic review of methods and outcome indicators used,"BACKGROUND: Developing human resources capacity is vital for tuberculosis (TB) control in low- and middle-income countries. Although investments in TB healthcare provider (HCP) training programmes have increased, it is unclear whether these are robustly evaluated. The objective of this systematic review was to synthesize the methods and outcome indicators used to assess TB HCP training programmes. METHODS: A systematic scoping review of publications reporting on evaluations of training programmes for TB HCPs - including doctors, nurses, paramedics, and lay health workers - was conducted through a search in three electronic databases, Google Scholar, and five websites of non-profit organizations. Data on the study location, population trained, outcomes assessed, and evaluation approach were extracted. RESULTS: After screening 499 unique publications, 21 were eligible for inclusion in the analysis. The majority of evaluations were conducted in Africa. The most common evaluation methods were a review of patient records (n=8, 38%) and post-training interview with trainees (n=7, 33%). In terms of outcomes, more than half of the studies (n=12, 57%) evaluated knowledge acquisition of trainees, with only six (29%) assessing on-the-job behaviour change. CONCLUSIONS: Even though more funds have been invested in TB HCP training, publications from robust evaluations assessing the impact on quality of care and behaviour change are limited.","Wu, Shishi; Roychowdhury, Imara; Khan, Mishal",Int.

Gender differences in cooperation and competition: The male-warrior hypothesis: Research report,"Evolutionary scientists argue that human cooperation is the product of a long history of competition among rival groups. There are various reasons to believe that this logic applies particularly to men. In three experiments, using a step-level public-goods task, we found that men contributed more to their group if their group was competing with other groups than if there was no intergroup competition. Female cooperation was relatively unaffected by intergroup competition. These findings suggest that men respond more strongly than women to intergroup threats. We speculate about the evolutionary origins of this gender difference and note some implications.

Sexual selection for moral virtues,"Moral evolution theories have emphasized kinship, reciprocity, group selection, and equilibrium selection. Yet, moral virtues are also sexually attractive. Darwin suggested that sexual attractiveness may explain many aspects of human morality. This paper updates his argument by integrating recent research on mate choice, person perception, individual differences, costly signaling, and virtue ethics. Many human virtues may have evolved in both sexes through mutual mate choice to advertise good genetic quality, parenting abilities, and/or partner traits. Such virtues may include kindness, fidelity, magnanimity, and heroism, as well as quasi-moral traits like conscientiousness, agreeableness, mental health, and intelligence. This theory leads to many testable predictions about the phenotypic features, genetic bases, and social-cognitive responses to human moral virtues. Copyright © 2007 by The University of Chicago.

Human cooperation: Evolutionary approaches to a complex phenomenon,"Humans work together to achieve common goals on larger scales and in a wider variety of ways than do members of any other species. In a word, they cooperate. They do so despite many obstacles to cooperation, which come in two main varieties: (l) collective action dilemmas, which arise from conflicts of interest among would-be cooperators, and (2) coordination problems, which arise from a lack of common knowledge about how cooperation can be achieved. Evolutionary scientists have identified a variety of factors that help people solve these problems. These include kinship, a high likelihood of repeated interactions, an ability to distinguish coop-erators from noncooperators and preferentially associate with the former, concerns about audiences and resulting reputations, an ability to send and receive signals regarding individuals’ levels of commitment to cooperative enterprises, and the importance of dealing with an uncertain future through risk-pooling arrangements. Although we understand a great deal more about the evolution of human coopera-tion now than we did a half century ago, when this approach was first developing, much work remains to be done. Some current frontiers in the evolutionary analysis of human cooperation include the study of coordination problems, cultural group selection, coalitional psychology, and a greater appreciation of the institutional and organizational contexts in which most human cooperation occurs. © 2015, Taylor & Francis.

"Protocols for uncontrolled donation after circulatory death: a systematic review of international guidelines, practices and transplant outcomes","INTRODUCTION: A chronic shortage of organs remains the main factor limiting organ transplantation. Many countries have explored the option of uncontrolled donation after circulatory death (uDCD) in order to expand the donor pool. Little is known regarding the variability of practices and outcomes between existing protocols. This systematic review addresses this knowledge gap informing policy makers, researchers, and clinicians for future protocol implementation. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Google Scholar electronic databases from 2005 to March 2015 as well as the reference lists of selected studies, abstracts, unpublished reports, personal libraries, professional organization reports, and government agency statements on uDCD. We contacted leading authors and organizations to request their protocols and guidelines. Two reviewers extracted main variables. In studies reporting transplant outcomes, we added type, quantity, quality of organs procured, and complications reported. Internal validity and the quality of the studies reporting outcomes were assessed, as were the methodological rigour and transparency in which a guideline was developed. The review was included in the international prospective register of systematic reviews (Prospero, CRD42014015258). RESULTS: Six guidelines and 18 outcome studies were analysed. The six guidelines are based on limited evidence and major differences exist between them at each step of the uDCD process. The outcome studies report good results for kidney, liver, and lung transplantation with high discard rates for livers. CONCLUSIONS: Despite procedural, medical, economic, legal, and ethical challenges, the uDCD strategy is a viable option for increasing the organ donation pool. Variations in practice and heterogeneity of outcomes preclude a meta-analysis and prevented the linking of outcomes to specific uDCD protocols. Further standardization of protocols and outcomes is required, as is further research into the role of extracorporeal resuscitation and other novel therapies for treatment of some refractory cardiac arrest. It is essential to ensure the maintenance of trust in uDCD programs by health professionals and the public.","Ortega-Deballon, Iván; Hornby, Laura; Shemie, Sam D",Crit. Care,1548
Partner choice creates competitive altruism in humans,"Reciprocal altruism has been the backbone of research on the evolution of altruistic behaviour towards nonkin, but recent research has begun to apply costly signalling theory to this problem. In addition to signalling resources or abilities, public generosity could function as a costly signal of cooperative intent, benefiting altruists in terms of (i) better access to cooperative relationships and (ii) greater cooperation within those relationships. When future interaction partners can choose with whom they wish to interact, this could lead to competition to be more generous than others. Little empirical work has tested for the possible existence of this 'competitive altruism'. Using a cooperative monetary game with and without opportunities for partner choice and signalling cooperative intent, we show here that people actively compete to be more generous than others when they can benefit from being chosen for cooperative partnerships, and the most generous people are correspondingly chosen more often as cooperative partners. We also found evidence for increased scepticism of altruistic signals when the potential reputational benefits for dishonest signalling were high. Thus, this work supports the hypothesis that public generosity can be a signal of cooperative intent, which people sometimes 'fake' when conditions permit it. © 2006 The Royal Society.","Barclay, P.; Willer, R.",Proc.

A meta-analysis of personality and workplace safety: addressing unanswered questions,"[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 100(2) of Journal of Applied Psychology (see record 2015-08139-001). Table 3 contained formatting errors. Minus signs used to indicate negative statistical estimates within the table were inadvertently changed to m-dashes. All versions of this article have been corrected.] The purpose of this meta-analysis was to address unanswered questions regarding the associations between personality and workplace safety by (a) clarifying the magnitude and meaning of these associations with both broad and facet-level personality traits, (b) delineating how personality is associated with workplace safety, and (c) testing the relative importance of personality in comparison to perceptions of the social context of safety (i.e., safety climate) in predicting safety-related behavior. Our results revealed that whereas agreeableness and conscientiousness were negatively associated with unsafe behaviors, extraversion and neuroticism were positively associated with them. Of these traits, agreeableness accounted for the largest proportion of explained variance in safety-related behavior and openness to experience was unrelated. At the facet level, sensation seeking, altruism, anger, and impulsiveness were all meaningfully associated with safety-related behavior, though sensation seeking was the only facet that demonstrated a stronger relationship than its parent trait (i.e., extraversion). In addition, meta-analytic path modeling supported the theoretical expectation that personality's associations with accidents are mediated by safety-related behavior. Finally, although safety climate perceptions accounted for the majority of explained variance in safety-related behavior, personality traits (i.e., agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism) still accounted for a unique and substantive proportion of the explained variance. Taken together, these results substantiate the value of considering personality traits as key correlates of workplace safety.","Beus, Jeremy M; Dhanani, Lindsay Y; McCord, Mallory A",J. Appl.

Effects of a guilt induction and guilt reduction on door in the face,"The present study explored the role of guilt in the door-in-the-face procedure. Drawing on the guilt-based explanation of door-in-the-face effect, it was hypothesized that the greatest amount of compliance would occur when the rejection of the initial request produced high levels of guilt and the acceptance of the small request allowed participants to anticipate a large reduction in guilt. This hypothesis was tested by presenting participants with an initial large request. Statements accompanying the request were designed to produce either high levels of guilt or low levels of guilt when the request was rejected. After the initial request, participants were presented with a second smaller request that was accompanied by statements that would make compliance with the request either more effective or less effective at guilt reduction. Compliance with the second request was recorded, and the results supported the hypothesis.","Millar, M.",Commun. Res.,1551
Giving is Caring: Understanding donation behavior through email,"Every day, thousands of people make donations to humanitarian, political, environmental, and other causes, a large amount of which occur on the Internet. The solicitations for support, the acknowledgment of a donation and the discussion of corresponding issues are often conducted via email, leaving a record of these social phenomena. In this paper, we describe a comprehensive large-scale data-driven study of donation behavior. We analyze a two-month anonymized email log from several perspectives motivated by past studies on charitable giving: (i) demographics, (ii) user interest, (iii) external timerelated factors and (iv) social network influence. We show that email captures the demographic peculiarities of different interest groups, for instance, predicting demographic distributions found in US 2012 Presidential Election exit polls. Furthermore, we find that people respond to major national events, as well as to solicitations with special promotions, and that social connections are the most important factor in predicting donation behavior. Specifically, we identify trends not only for individual charities and campaigns, but also for high-level categories such as political campaigns, medical illnesses, and humanitarian relief. Thus, we show the extent to which large-scale email datasets reveal human donation behavior, and explore the limitations of such analysis.

Gender differences in self-view and desired salaries: A study on online recruitment website users in China,"One explanation for the gender pay differences in labor markets is that women propose lower desired salaries. By using an actual job seeking resume database and applying text mining techniques, we are able to observe both the extent of gender differences in desired salaries and job-related self-view. We find gender differences in global self-view favoring females, and in some domain-specific self-view favoring males. Previous findings of disadvantaged groups having levels of self-view at least as high as those of advantaged groups lend credibility to our findings. Moreover, we argue that the differences in global self-view favoring females may be related to the theories of “belief flipping”, since women in our sample of online-recruitment markets are distinct from the general population, with on average 15.2 years of education and 8.99 years of work experience, due to self-selection. In addition, we find that women do propose lower desired salary than men, after controlling for various factors such as human capital, marital status, industries. We further investigate the role of self-view and find it contributes to explain desired salaries, with modest mediator effect but little moderator effect on gender differences in desired salaries. © 2019 Zhang, Zheng.

Prevalence and trend of hepatitis C virus infection among blood donors in Chinese mainland: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"BACKGROUND: Blood transfusion is one of the most common transmission pathways of hepatitis C virus (HCV). This paper aims to provide a comprehensive and reliable tabulation of available data on the epidemiological characteristics and risk factors for HCV infection among blood donors in Chinese mainland, so as to help make prevention strategies and guide further research. METHODS: A systematic review was constructed based on the computerized literature database. Infection rates and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated using the approximate normal distribution model. Odds ratios and 95% CI were calculated by fixed or random effects models. Data manipulation and statistical analyses were performed using STATA 10.0 and ArcGIS 9.3 was used for map construction. RESULTS: Two hundred and sixty-five studies met our inclusion criteria. The pooled prevalence of HCV infection among blood donors in Chinese mainland was 8.68% (95% CI: 8.01%-9.39%), and the epidemic was severer in North and Central China, especially in Henan and Hebei. While a significant lower rate was found in Yunnan. Notably, before 1998 the pooled prevalence of HCV infection was 12.87% (95%CI: 11.25%-14.56%) among blood donors, but decreased to 1.71% (95%CI: 1.43%-1.99%) after 1998. No significant difference was found in HCV infection rates between male and female blood donors, or among different blood type donors. The prevalence of HCV infection was found to increase with age. During 1994-1995, the prevalence rate reached the highest with a percentage of 15.78% (95%CI: 12.21%-19.75%), and showed a decreasing trend in the following years. A significant difference was found among groups with different blood donation types, Plasma donors had a relatively higher prevalence than whole blood donors of HCV infection (33.95% vs 7.9%). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of HCV infection has rapidly decreased since 1998 and kept a low level in recent years, but some provinces showed relatively higher prevalence than the general population. It is urgent to make efficient measures to prevent HCV secondary transmission and control chronic progress, and the key to reduce the HCV incidence among blood donors is to encourage true voluntary blood donors, strictly implement blood donation law, and avoid cross-infection.","Gao, Xiaofei; Cui, Qian; Shi, Xiang; Su, Jing; Peng, Zhihang; Chen, Xin; Lei, Na; Ding, Keqin; Wang, Lu; Yu, Rongbin; Wang, Ning",BMC Infect.

The Dietary Quality of Food Pantry Users: A Systematic Review of Existing Literature,"BACKGROUND: Users of food pantries often have a long history of food insecurity and may be vulnerable to nutritional deficiencies. The quality of their diets is not well researched. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this systematic review was to summarize the published evidence about the dietary quality of food pantry users. METHODS: Systematic database searches of PubMed, PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, and Psychology Behavioral Sciences Collection, and hand searches of references were conducted to identify cross-sectional, cohort, and intervention studies reporting baseline data, conducted in high-income countries and published between 1980 and 2015, which reported on the nutritional adequacy of individuals who have used a food pantry at least once in the previous 12 months. All identified citations were screened and independently assessed for eligibility. Results for dietary quality were summarized for overall diet quality, energy, food groups, macro- and micronutrients separately. The risk of bias of included studies was evaluated by using criteria of an adapted Ottawa Scale. The systematic review was reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. RESULTS: After applying predefined eligibility criteria, 16 articles were identified for inclusion. The diet quality among included food pantry users was low, as reflected by inadequate mean group intake of energy, fruits and vegetables, dairy products, and calcium. Even if the group mean intake was adequate, large percentages of study populations did not meet the recommendations for vitamins A, C, D, and B vitamins, or iron, magnesium, and zinc. The representativeness of the studies varied widely and none of them were nationally representative. CONCLUSION: The current evidence suggests that the dietary intake of most food pantry users does not meet recommendations. Future research should draw more representative samples and investigate the impact of food pantries on users' diet.","Simmet, Anja; Depa, Julia; Tinnemann, Peter; Stroebele-Benschop, Nanette",J.

"Pride, mindfulness, public self-awareness, affective satisfaction, and customer citizenship behaviour among green restaurant customers","Although research on the self has a long history with various psychological perspectives, the role of the self in visiting green restaurants has not been sufficiently explored. This study investigated the influence of public self-awareness (PSA) as a mechanism of the motivation for green restaurant consumption on customers’ satisfaction and customer citizenship behaviour (CCB). Additionally, this study examined customers’ pride and mindfulness as antecedents of their PSA. A survey of 341 regular customers of green restaurants was conducted, and the partial least square method was used to analyse the data. The findings indicated a positive association between pride and PSA, as well as between mindfulness and PSA. Furthermore, PSA influenced affective satisfaction and CCB, and affective satisfaction had a positive impact on CCB. The theoretical and practical implications of the findings are discussed. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Hwang, K.; Lee, B.",Int. J. Hosp. Manage.,1557

Psilocybin and mdma reduce costly punishment in the ultimatum game,"Disruptions in social decision-making are becoming evident in many psychiatric conditions. These are studied using paradigms investigating the psychological mechanisms underlying interpersonal interactions, such as the Ultimatum Game (UG). Rejection behaviour in the UG represents altruistic punishment-the costly punishment of norm violators-but the mechanisms underlying it require clarification. To investigate the psychopharmacology of UG behaviour, we carried out two studies with healthy participants, employing serotonergic agonists: psilocybin (open-label, within-participant design, N = 19) and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover design, N = 20). We found that both MDMA and psilocybin reduced rejection of unfair offers (odds ratio: 0.57 and 0.42, respectively). The reduction in rejection rate following MDMA was associated with increased prosociality (R2 = 0.26, p = 0.025). In the MDMA study, we investigated third-party decision-making and proposer behaviour. MDMA did not reduce rejection in the third-party condition, but produced an increase in the amount offered to others (Cohens d = 0.82). We argue that these compounds altered participants conceptualisation of social reward, placing more emphasis on the direct relationship with interacting partners. With these compounds showing efficacy in drug-Assisted psychotherapy, these studies are an important step in the further characterisation of their psychological effects. © 2018 The Author(s).","Gabay, A.S.; Carhart-Harris, R.L.; Mazibuko, N.; Kempton, M.J.; Morrison, P.D.; Nutt, D.J.; Mehta, M.A.",Sci.

Altruistic punishment in humans,"Human cooperation is an evolutionary puzzle. Unlike other creatures, people frequently cooperate with genetically unrelated strangers, often in large groups, with people they will never meet again, and when reputation gains are small or absent. These patterns of cooperation cannot be explained by the nepotistic motives associated with the evolutionary theory of kin selection and the selfish motives associated with signalling theory or the theory of reciprocal altruism. Here we show experimentally that the altruistic punishment of defectors is a key motive for the explanation of cooperation. Altruistic punishment means that individuals punish, although the punishment is costly for them and yields no material gain. We show that cooperation flourishes if altruistic punishment is possible, and breaks down if it is ruled out. The evidence indicates that negative emotions towards defectors are the proximate mechanism behind altruistic punishment. These results suggest that future study of the evolution of human cooperation should include a strong focus on explaining altruistic punishment.","Fehr, E.; Gächter, S.",Nature,1562
"Five-Year Olds, but Not Chimpanzees, Attempt to Manage Their Reputations","Virtually all theories of the evolution of cooperation require that cooperators find ways to interact with one another selectively, to the exclusion of cheaters. This means that individuals must make reputational judgments about others as cooperators, based on either direct or indirect evidence. Humans, and possibly other species, add another component to the process: they know that they are being judged by others, and so they adjust their behavior in order to affect those judgments - so-called impression management. Here, we show for the first time that already preschool children engage in such behavior. In an experimental study, 5-year-old human children share more and steal less when they are being watched by a peer than when they are alone. In contrast, chimpanzees behave the same whether they are being watched by a groupmate or not. This species difference suggests that humans' concern for their own self-reputation, and their tendency to manage the impression they are making on others, may be unique to humans among primates. © 2012 Engelmann et al.","Engelmann, J.M.; Herrmann, E.; Tomasello, M.",PLoS ONE,1563
Group Status and Reciprocity Norms: Can the Door-in-the-Face Effect Be Obtained in an Out-Group Context?,The psychological underpinnings of the door-in-the-face (DITF) effect are examined in 2 experiments. The research contrasts the traditional reciprocal concessions interpretation of the effect with arguments based on social identity and perceptual contrast. Study 1 replicated the DITF effect in contemporary France and clarified earlier methodological ambiguities to rule out an explanation based on perceptual contrast. Study 2 manipulated the traditional DITF variables along with the in-group-out-group status of the petitioner and suggested that the effects of earlier research were enhanced by participants' presumption of the petitioner's in-group status. These experiments demonstrate that both reciprocal concessions and in-group bias operate as additive factors in producing the DITF effect and that the original research probably profited from participants' implicit assumptions of common identity while supporting the hypothesis of some universal norm for reciprocal concessions. © 2009 American Psychological Association.,"Lecat, B.; Hilton, D.J.; Crano, W.D.",Group Dyn.,1564

Stochasticity in economic losses increases the value of reputation in indirect reciprocity,"Recent theory predicts harsh and stochastic conditions to generally promote the evolution of cooperation. Here, we test experimentally whether stochasticity in economic losses also affects the value of reputation in indirect reciprocity, a type of cooperation that is very typical for humans. We used a repeated helping game with observers. One subject (the "" Unlucky"") lost some money, another one (the "" Passer-by"") could reduce this loss by accepting a cost to herself, thereby building up a reputation that could be used by others in later interactions. The losses were either stable or stochastic, but the average loss over time and the average efficiency gains of helping were kept constant in both treatments. We found that players with a reputation of being generous were generally more likely to receive help by others, such that investing into a good reputation generated long-term benefits that compensated for the immediate costs of helping. Helping frequencies were similar in both treatments, but players with a reputation to be selfish lost more resources under stochastic conditions. Hence, returns on investment were steeper when losses varied than when they did not. We conclude that this type of stochasticity increases the value of reputation in indirect reciprocity.","Dos Santos, M.; Placì, S.; Wedekind, C.",Sci. Rep.,1567
"Norm, gender, and bribe-giving: Insights from a behavioral game","Previous research has suggested that bribery is more normative in some countries than in others. To understand the underlying process, this paper examines the effects of social norm and gender on bribe-giving behavior. We argue that social norms provide information for strategic planning and impression management, and thus would impact participants’ bribe amount. Besides, males are more agentic and focus more on impression management than females. We predicted that males would defy the norm in order to win when the amount of their bribe was kept private, but would conform to the norm when it was made public. To test this hypothesis, we conducted two studies using a competitive game. In each game, we asked three participants to compete in five rounds of creative tasks, and the winner was determined by a referee’s subjective judgment of the participants’ performance on the tasks. Participants were allowed to give bribes to the referee. Bribe-giving norms were manipulated in two domains: norm level (high vs. low) and norm context (private vs. public), in order to investigate the influence of informational and affiliational needs. Studies 1 and 2 consistently showed that individuals conformed to the norm level of bribe-giving while maintaining a relative advantage for economic benefit. Study 2 found that males gave larger bribes in the private context than in the public, whereas females gave smaller bribes in both contexts. We used a latent growth curve model (LGCM) to depict the development of bribe-giving behaviors during five rounds of competition. The results showed that gender, creative performance, and norm level all influence the trajectory of bribe-giving behavior. © 2017 Lan, Hong.

Gender differences in honesty: The role of social value orientation,"This paper experimentally analyzes the role of individual social value orientation (SVO) on honest behavior. We focus on a situation where dishonest behavior pays off at somebody else's cost. In which case, distributional preferences might matter for the willingness to act honestly. To examine this link we conduct a laboratory experiment where we first elicit SVO to measure distributional preferences. Afterwards, we implement a die rolling game to elicit dishonest behavior at an individual level. We detect a positive correlation between subjects’ SVO angle and honest behavior. Furthermore, the data confirm common gender differences, i.e., women are significantly more honest than men. Additionally, we find that, on average, women have higher SVO angles than men. A mediation analysis reveals that SVO explains the gender effect. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Grosch, K.; Rau, H.A.",J. Econ. Psychol.,1569

The Relative Effectiveness of Three Compliance Techniques in Eliciting Donations to a Cultural Organization,"To compare the relative effectiveness of three compliance techniques during a museum fund‐raising drive, 89 individuals were asked to contribute $1 to the museum after having been exposed to an initial request according to one of the following conditions: (1) in the foot‐in‐thedoor condition, individuals were first asked to sign a petition in support of the museum; (2) in the door‐in‐the‐face condition, they were initially asked for a $5 contribution; (3) in the. low‐ball condition, they were asked to contribute 75 cents and then to increase this amount by 25 cents in order to support the children's program: and (4) in the control condition, subjects simply received the target request for $1. The groups differed significantly in terms of the number of individuals who donated, and in the amount of their contributions. The low‐ball condition was generally the most effective, especially with respect to the amount of money contributed. This was followed in turn by the door‐in‐the‐face and control conditions, with the foot‐in‐the‐door condition the least effective in virtually every comparison. These findings are discussed in terms of their implications for the experimental analysis of compliance, as well as the development of more effective fund‐raising programs.

Encouraging Charitable Contributions: An Examination of Three Models of Door-in-the-Face Compliance,"This study tested three models of the door-in-the-face (DITF) compliance strategy—reciprocal concessions, perceptual contrast, and self-presentation. These accounts were tested in a fundraising context by manipulating the variables concession labeling, initial request size, and anticipated future interaction in a 2 × 2 × 2 factorial design with a stand-alone control group. The hypothesized mediating variable for each account—obligation, cost concerns, and image concerns—was assessed. A DITF effect was obtained. With regard to the models, concession labeling led to stronger feelings of obligation to donate, but did not affect compliance. The manipulation of anticipated interaction elevated impression management concerns, but these concerns did not motivate donating. The failure of the concession and self-presentation accounts is explained by their interaction; concession labeling facilitated charity when interaction with the solicitor was anticipated, but backfired when interaction was not expected. No support was found for the perceptual contrast explanation. © 1994, Sage. All rights reserved.","Abrahams, M.F.; Bell, R.A.",Commun. Res.,1575
The Politics of Donations: Are Red Counties More Donative Than Blue Counties?,"This article integrates parallel literatures about the determinants of redistribution across place. Using regression-based path analysis, we explore how tax burden mediates the relationship between political conditions and charitable contributions. Our analysis indicates that counties with a higher proportion of people voting Republican report higher charitable contributions, and tax burden partially mediates this relationship. However, the effect of political ideology on charitable contributions is nonlinear. As the proportion voting Republican in non-Republican-dominated counties increases, the predicted levels of charitable giving actually decreases. In contrast, as the proportion voting Republican increases in Republican-dominated counties, charitable contributions increase. Higher levels of political competition decrease charitable giving, again with partial mediation by tax burden. We also find that the “crowding in” effect of lower tax burdens on charitable giving only partially compensates for the loss of public revenue. Ultimately, total levels of redistribution—both private and government—are higher in Democratic-leaning counties. © The Author(s) 2018.","Paarlberg, L.E.; Nesbit, R.; Clerkin, R.M.; Christensen, R.K.",Nonprofit Volunt.

Multiple reputation domains and cooperative Behaviour in two Latin American communities,"Reputations are a ubiquitous feature of human social life, and a large literature has been dedicated to explaining the relationship between prosocial reputations and cooperation in social dilemmas. However, humans form reputations in domains other than prosociality, such as economic competency that could affect cooperation. To date, no research has evaluated the relative effects of multiple reputation domains on cooperation. To bridge this gap, we analyse how prosocial and competency reputations affect cooperation in two Latin American communities (Bwa Mawego, Dominica, and Pucucanchita, Peru) across a number of social contexts (Dominica: labour contracting, labour exchange and conjugal partnership formation; Peru: agricultural and health advice network size). First, we examine the behavioural correlates of prosocial and competency reputations. Following, we analyse whether prosocial, competency, or both reputation domains explain the flow of cooperative benefits within the two communities. Our analyses suggest that (i) although some behaviours affect both reputation domains simultaneously, each reputation domain has a unique behavioural signature; and (ii) competency reputations affect cooperation across a greater number of social contexts compared to prosocial reputations. Results are contextualized with reference to the social markets in which behaviour is embedded and a call for greater theory development is stressed. © 2015 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

"Pilots and athletes: Different concerns, similar concussion non-disclosure","Objectives Concussion non-disclosure research has focused almost exclusively on athletes. The focus on athletic populations has been sensible considering athletes’ demonstrated susceptibility to sustaining and concealing concussions. Nevertheless, the habitual use of athletic populations has allowed researchers and practitioners to omit the development of generalized perceived costs and perceived rewards as critical determinants of concussion self-disclosure. We hypothesized that perceiving concussion disclosure as generally more costly than rewarding would predict negative attitudes towards disclosure and decreased intent to disclose. We also hypothesized that generalized perceived costs and rewards could explain concussion non-disclosure in different populations, athletes and future pilots specifically, even when those populations perceive concussion self-disclosure as costly for different specific reasons. Methods We examined concussion disclosure using 2,504 cadets at the United States Air Force Academy. Cadets completed anonymous surveys assessing their intention to self-disclose undiagnosed concussions (Anticipated Concussion Disclosure) as well as several variables potentially related to concussion self-disclosure: perceived cost, perceived reward, personal identity, attitudes, normative behavior, social support, and self-efficacy. Results The results demonstrate that concussion non-disclosure develops when a population perceives disclosure as more costly (i.e. directly or emotionally) and less rewarding. Perceived Cost and Perceived Reward variables alone accounted for 50% of the variance in Anticipated Conclusion Disclosure (Adjusted R2 = 0.50, F(2,2312) = 1,145.31, p &lt; 0.001). As expected, Anticipated Conclusion Disclosure developed for different reasons within different sub-populations. Consistent with existing research, cadet intercollegiate athletes reported being primarily concerned that concussion self-disclosure would cause them to miss practice or game time (t (736.7) = 14.20, p &lt; .001, Cohen’s d = 0.96). In contrast, cadet future pilots reported being primarily concerned that concussion self-disclosure would have negative United States Air Force career repercussions (t (1828) = 10.25, p &lt; .001, Cohen’s d = 0.50). Conclusions These results suggest that cultures of concussion non-disclosure can develop in any population where disclosure is perceived as having undesirable consequences, not just athletic populations. Concussion researchers and practitioners should devote more attention to the perceived cost-benefit structures that create concussion non-disclosure to address this crucial public health issue more effectively.

Are church and state substitutes? Evidence from the 1996 welfare reform,"Churches provide community services similar to those provided by the government, but there has been no convincing analysis of the extent to which church activity can substitute for government activity. To address this important issue, this paper uses a new panel data set of Presbyterian Church (USA) congregations to regress both church-member donations and a church's community spending on a number of variables, including government welfare expenditures. A provision of the 1996 welfare law that decreased the availability and use of welfare services by non-citizens serves as an instrument to identify the causal effect of government spending on church activity. The results show that church activities substitute for government activities. Extrapolating the findings to all denominations, the estimated ""crowd-out"" effect lies between 20 and 38 cents on the dollar.

The time interval in the intention-behaviour relationship: Meta-analysis,"Intention-behaviour models specify as a boundary condition that the intention-behaviour relationship should be measured over a short period of delay. However, a measure of intention that exists just prior to performance of the behaviour has limited feasibility and practical utility. Using meta-analysis, the present study explores the relationship between time and the intention-behaviour (I-B) correlation in Fishbein and Ajzen's intention-behaviour models. Self-reported behaviours, how intention is measured, and type of behaviour are explored as moderators to this relationship. The average I-B correlation coefficient remains strong over a prediction interval of as long as 15 years. The I-B correlation is significantly influenced by the use of self-report measures of behaviour over time and type of behaviour; however, it is not influenced by how intention is measured.","Randall, Donna M; Wolff, James A",British Journal of Social Psychology,1581

Crafting messages to fight dishonesty: A field investigation of the effects of social norms and watching eye cues on fare evasion,"The impact of watching eyes cues and descriptive social norm messages on fare evasion was studied in two experiments that were conducted in two railway stations in France. In Study 1, a natural field experiment, passengers were exposed for a two-week period to either a control eye-cues poster or to an experimental eye-cues with a social norm messaging campaign. In Study 2, an artefactual experiment in the field, participants in the experimental train station were asked to participate in a lying task before and after they were exposed to the messaging campaign. The results from both studies suggest that although watching eye cues alone are not effective in a crowded train station, exposing passengers to watching eye cues together with a descriptive social norm messaging campaign reduced the fare evasion rates observed by standard inspection operations, and eliminated lying behavior measured by the die-under-cup paradigm. These results strengthen the external validity of laboratory experiments that have documented small scale cheating behavior and highlight the potential benefits of internal enforcement techniques to fight dishonesty in the field. In addition, they stress the advantage of combining visibility cues and social norms when orienting people toward more moral behavior. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Ayal, S.; Celse, J.; Hochman, G.",Organ.

Response properties of the human fusiform face area,"We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to study the response properties of the human fusiform face area (FFA: Kanwisher, McDermott, and Chun, 1997) to a variety of face-like stimuli in order to clarify the functional role of this region. FFA responses were found to be (1) equally strong for cat, cartoon and human faces despite very different image properties, (2) equally strong for entire human faces and faces with eyes occluded but weaker for eyes shown alone, (3) equal for front and profile views of human heads, but declining in strength as faces rotated away from view, and (4) weakest for nonface objects and houses. These results indicate that generalisation of the FFA response across very different face types cannot be explained in terms of a specific response to a salient facial feature such as the eyes or a more general response to heads. Instead, the FFA appears to be optimally tuned to the broad category of faces.","Tong, F.; Nakayama, K.; Moscovitch, M.; Weinrib, O.; Kanwisher, N.",Cogn. Neuropsychol.,1584

When immediate, on‐the‐spot donations were requested, the technique significantly increased compliance rates relative to control conditions; but when the respondents were asked to mail in their contributions, virtually none did. The results offered some support for an image‐maintenance explanation of the technique and were viewed as indicating that the effectiveness of the technique is reliable, but primarily under conditions that impose a high degree of situational constraint upon respondents. Implications of the results for door‐to‐door fundraising and for future research were discussed. Copyright © 1987, Wiley Blackwell.

Achieving triple “P” bottom line through resonant leadership: an Indian perspective,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to review the extant literature on resonant leadership and develop a conceptual framework about the role played by resonant leaders of crisis-ridden firms in developing employees for achieving triple 'P' bottom line. Design/methodology/approach: A systematic review of literature was conducted from 1994 to 2015 with key words leadership, resonant leadership, and triple 'P' bottom line. Related research papers were searched from select databases of Elsevier, Emerald, Sage, Springer, Taylor and Francis, Wiley, and other library services of Proquest, Ebsco, and Scopus. Findings: Resonant leaders motivate their subordinates by being compassionate toward them, showing an overall positive mood, and through guidance for achieving sustainable triple 'P' bottom line. India is a secular country that emphasizes on spiritual beliefs as well as on socio-cultural and religious values. Therefore, Indian managers generally adopt these values in their early socialization process by following traditional epics and religious scriptures. They spread positive emotions among their subordinates and raise their level of consciousness by exhibiting altruistic values. Therefore, altruism could be considered as an additional dimension of resonant leadership style of Indian managers for downsized firms. These leaders nurture surviving employees at the time of economic crisis to build a sustainable triple 'P' bottom line. Originality/value: Altruism can be considered as a new dimension of resonant leadership style of Indian managers for downsized firms. These leaders provide a sense of psychological security to their employees by developing a value led organization with meaningful vision and an edge over their competitors.

"The psychological reality of the door-in-the-face it's helping, not bargaining","Door-in-the-face (DITF) is a sequential request technique in which a source first makes a large request. Upon the receiver's refusal, a smaller (target) request is made. DITF has been found to increase compliance with the target request compared to control conditions where only the target request is made. Despite its effectiveness, DITF lacks a consistently supported theoretical explanation. Two studies were conducted to determine whether people see DITF as a bargaining situation, consistent with the reciprocal concessions explanation, or as a helping situation, consistent with a social responsibility explanation. In Study 1, 78 participants judged the relevance of helping and bargaining items to four DITF interactions. In Study 2, 80 participants rated the similarity of a DITF interaction to four interactions that crossed situation (helping versus bargaining) with relationship (friend versus stranger). Results of both studies were consistent with a social responsibility explanation of DITF but inconsistent with reciprocal concessions.","Tusing, K.J.; Dillard, J.P.",J. Lang. Soc. Psychol.,1593
Being watched in an investment game setting: Behavioral changes when making risky decisions,"We design a laboratory experiment to test for behavioral differences due to observation within a novel arena: investment games. We find that fund managers are more risk-averse when investors can observe their investment allocations. This effect is more pronounced when investors, in addition to observing the allocations, can also observe the investment outcomes. Interestingly, allowing investors to observe how their investment is allocated does not impact how much they invest. Last, when the outcome of the risky investment is public knowledge, disclosing managers’ allocations leads them to return more tokens to investors and to expropriate fewer tokens for themselves at the end of the game, ceteris paribus. We discuss potential causes of these effects. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Jia, Z.T.; McMahon, M.J.",J. Behave. Exp. Econ.,1594
Longitudinal relations between prosocial television content and adolescents' prosocial and aggressive behavior: The mediating role of empathic concern and self-regulation,"The current study examined longitudinal cross-lagged associations between prosocial TV (content and time) and prosocial and aggressive behavior during adolescence, and explored the mediating role of empathic concern and self-regulation. Participants were 441 adolescents who reported on their 3 favorite TV shows at 2 time points, approximately 2 years apart (M age of child at Time 3 = 13.31, SD = 1.06; 52% female; M age of child at Time 5 = 15.27, SD = 1.06). Results suggested that prosocial content at Time 3 was negatively associated with aggressive behavior 2 years later, and aggressive behavior at Time 3 was positively associated with aggressive content 2 years later. Results also suggested that prosocial behavior toward strangers at Time 3 was associated with both empathic concern and self-regulation at Time 4, which were in turn associated with prosocial and aggressive content at Time 5. Discussion focuses on the important role of behavior and prosocial personality on media selection during adolescence and the relevance of the target of prosocial behavior. © 2015 American Psychological Association.","Padilla-Walker, L.M.; Coyne, S.M.; Collier, K.M.; Nielson, M.G.",Dev.

Organizational Antecedents of Nonprofit Engagement in Policy Advocacy: A Meta-Analytical Review,"Policy advocacy by nonprofits has attracted substantial scholarly interest in recent years. Although considerable empirical studies have examined factors influencing nonprofit participation in policy advocacy, the existing evidence remains inconsistent as to what factors influence nonprofits to engage in policy advocacy and to what extent. The present study conducts a meta-analysis to quantitatively synthesize existing studies on the organizational antecedents of nonprofit advocacy engagement. Through systematically reviewing 46 studies and aggregating 559 effect sizes on 17 organizational predictors, the study finds organizational size, professionalization, board support, constituent involvement, knowledge about laws, government funding, private donations, foundation funding, collaboration, and negative policy environment have positive and significant relationships with a nonprofit’s level of advocacy engagement.

Intangible Assets and Performance in Nonprofit Organizations:A Systematic Literature Review,"Nonprofit organizations (NPOs) promote citizens’ participation in community life through several different kinds of organizations: some more informal (such as associations and volunteering groups), others more formal or public (such as charities and foundations). This heterogeneity, as well as the well-known peculiarities of NPOs when compared to profit and public ones, poses new challenges to their management. In the constant need to find balance between financial constraints and social value, a main resource for NPOs is the management of intangible assets, such as knowledge, positive relationships within the organization and with users, external image, loyalty and commitment, and so on. From the literature on for-profit organizations, it is well known that proper management of intangible assets improves an organization’s sustainable competitive advantage, not only by enhancing its members’ affiliation and commitment but even by enhancing their productivity. This is particularly relevant when taking into account the main role of volunteers in the third sector. Volunteers, indeed, show different job attitudes and organizational behaviors than paid employees, as their membership and accountability are less formalized and they frequently lack a proper teamwork, due to the high volunteer turnover. At the same time, from the managers point of view, managing volunteers and paid workers require higher skills and competencies than managing human resources in for-profit organizations. Developing these reflections and considerations, we aim to conduct a systematic literature review on the association between intangible assets and performance in NPOs. The literature will be conducted following the indications from the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. It provides an evidence-based minimum set of items to be included in the review, as well as a workflow to properly manage and choose the papers to be included.

Systematic Review of Motives for Episodic Volunteering,"Although episodic volunteers are a critical resource for many organisations, their motives for volunteering are poorly understood. A systematic review was conducted to describe empirical evidence about motives for episodic volunteering (EV) across sectors (sport, tourism, events, health and social welfare). Identified EV motives were then categorised using core functions from the Volunteer Functions Inventory (VFI) for comparison across studies. Twelve databases (1990–December 2014) were searched. Thirty-three English language studies included results describing EV motives. Studies were predominantly cross-sectional, quantitative, event-based and originating in North America. Measurement of motives was also inconsistent. Common motives were helping others and socialising. Physical challenge and healing motives were specific to sport-based events and charity sport events, respectively. Over 80 % of motives were classified using VFI functions, particularly enhancement, values and social functions. The VFI supplemented by qualitative work may be efficacious to further identify EV motives and retention strategies. © 2015, International Society for Third-Sector Research and The Johns Hopkins University.","Dunn, Jeff; Chambers, Suzanne K; Hyde, Melissa K",VOLUNTAS: International Journal of Voluntary and Nonprofit Organizations,1599
“Even a single marble will make him/her happy …”: Further evidence and extension of the legitimizing paltry contribution technique on helping,"Previous research has found that the statement ``Even a penny will help'' incorporated in charity donation requests increases compliance. The present study analyzed the effectiveness of this technique using a novel solicitation and where the participant had no possibility to comply immediately with the request. Confederates asked customers in a hypermarket (e. g., Costco, Sam's Club) for a toy donation in aid of children. They wore a t-shirt on which the statement ``Even a single marble will make him/her happy...'' was either present or not. Results show that more people gave a toy when this statement appeared on the t-shirt.","Guéguen, Nicolas; Martin, Angélique; Meineri, Sébastien",Social Influence,1600
"Eye images increase generosity, but not for long: the limited effect of a false cue","People are more cooperative when explicitly observed, and simply exposing people to images of eyes or faces has been shown to increase cooperation of various types and in various contexts, albeit with notable, if controversial, exceptions. This ‘eyes effect’ is important both for its potential real-world applications and for its implications regarding the role of reputation in the evolution and maintenance of human cooperation. Based on the general principle that organisms eventually cease responding to uninformative stimuli, we predicted that the eyes effect would be eliminated by prolonged exposure. A novel experiment confirmed that participants exposed briefly to an eye-like image gave more money in an economic game than those in a longer exposure condition and those in a control condition. There was no generosity difference between the long exposure and control conditions. Furthermore, a meta-analysis of 25 eyes effects experiments confirmed that the effect emerges reliably after short exposures to eye images, but not after long exposures. An understanding of the limits of false cues on behaviour helps resolve empirical discrepancies regarding the eyes effect and exonerates the importance of reputation even in anonymous, one-shot interactions.

Does local treatment of the prostate in advanced and/or lymph node metastatic disease improve efficacy of androgen-deprivation therapy? A systematic review,"An interaction between local treatment and androgen-deprivation therapy was suggested in this review. In men with advanced and aggressive disease who were at a high risk of death from prostate cancer and who were treated with curative intent for their primary tumour, immediate and sustained androgen deprivation therapy improved overall survival and cancer-specific survival significantly. XCM: The research question was supported by inclusion criteria for participants, interventions, comparators, outcomes and study design. However, a wider variety of comparator interventions were included than stated in the inclusion criteria. Search terms were not reported, so the search strategy was not transparent or reproducible. Only two databases were searched for published studies and it was unclear whether language restrictions were applied. The review may be prone to publication bias and it is possible that relevant studies could have been missed. It was not reported whether steps were taken to minimise the risk of error and bias in the review process.Study quality did not appear to have been assessed, so the reliability of these studies and their results is not known. The authors stated that the primary study populations differed considerably in the analysis of immediate versus deferred androgen deprivation therapy, but statistical heterogeneity was substantial for several other analyses, so the results of these analyses may not be reliable.Several methodological limitations in the review process suggest that the authors' conclusions should be viewed with considerable caution. XIM: Practice: The authors stated that, although many clinicians hesitated to offer a local treatment to a patient who could not be cured, the current analysis suggested that this was an important component of the optimal therapy that contributed to better survival. Whether the survival advantage of combined treatment was large enough to counterbalance the side effects of prolonged androgen-deprivation therapy and local treatment was an issue that should be settled in discussion with an informed patient.Research: The authors did not state any implications for research.","Verhagen, P C; Schroder, F H; Collette, L; Bangma, C H",,1603
Complementary spiritist therapy: systematic review of scientific evidence,"Spiritism is the third most common religion in Brazil, and its therapies have been used by millions worldwide. These therapies are based on therapeutic resources including prayer, laying on of hands, fluidotherapy (magnetized water), charity/volunteering, spirit education/moral values, and disobsession (spirit release therapy). This paper presents a systematic review of the current literature on the relationship among health outcomes and 6 predictors: prayer, laying on of hands, magnetized/fluidic water, charity/volunteering, spirit education (virtuous life and positive affect), and spirit release therapy. All articles were analyzed according to inclusion/exclusion criteria, Newcastle-Ottawa and Jadad score. At present, there is moderate to strong evidence that volunteering and positive affect are linked to better health outcomes. Furthermore, laying on of hands, virtuous life, and praying for oneself also seem to be associated to positive findings. Nevertheless, there is a lack of studies on magnetized water and spirit release therapy. In summary, science is indirectly demonstrating that some of these therapies can be associated to better health outcomes and that other therapies have been overlooked or poorly investigated. Further studies in this field could contribute to the disciplines of Complementary and Alternative Medicine by investigating the relationship between body, mind, and soul/spirit.","Lucchetti, Giancarlo; Lucchetti, Alessandra L Granero; Bassi, Rodrigo M; Nobre, Marlene Rossi Severino",Evid.

"To know or not to know? Looking at payoffs signals selfish behavior, but it does not actually mean so","Costs and benefits of everyday actions are often not known beforehand. In such situations, people can either make a choice “without looking” at the payoffs, or they can “look” and learn the exact payoffs involved before making the actual choice. Recent studies suggest that the mere act of looking at payoffs will be met with distrust by observers: “lookers” are both less trustworthy and perceived to be less trustworthy than “non-lookers”. Here we extend this line of work by changing the measure of pro-sociality: instead of trustworthiness, we consider altruism. Does “looking at payoffs” signal self-regarding preferences? Do observers’ beliefs match decision makers’ actions? Two experiments demonstrate that: (i) the level of altruism among “lookers” is not different from the level of altruism among “non-lookers”, but (ii) “lookers” are perceived to be less altruistic than “non-lookers”. These results hold both when the measure of altruism is the choice whether to help or not in the so-called “envelope game” (Experiment 1) or when the measure of altruism is the donation in a standard Dictator Game (Experiment 2). In sum, these results uncover a perception gap according to which looking at payoffs signals selfish behavior, but it does not actually mean so. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Capraro, V.; Kuilder, J.",J.

"So different, yet so similar: meta-analysis and policy modeling of willingness to participate in clinical trials among Brazilians and Indians","BACKGROUND: With the global expansion of clinical trials and the expectations of the rise of the emerging economies known as BRICs (Brazil, Russia, India and China), the understanding of factors that affect the willingness to participate in clinical trials of patients from those countries assumes a central role in the future of health research. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis (SRMA) of willingness to participate in clinical trials among Brazilian patients and then we compared it with Indian patients (with results of another SRMA previously conducted by our group) through a system dynamics model. RESULTS: Five studies were included in the SRMA of Brazilian patients. Our main findings are 1) the major motivation for Brazilian patients to participate in clinical trials is altruism, 2) monetary reimbursement is the least important factor motivating Brazilian patients, 3) the major barrier for Brazilian patients to not participate in clinical trials is the fear of side effects, and 4) Brazilian patients are more likely willing to participate in clinical trials than Indians. CONCLUSION: Our study provides important insights for investigators and sponsors for planning trials in Brazil (and India) in the future. Ignoring these results may lead to unnecessary fund/time spending. More studies are needed to validate our results and for better understanding of this poorly studied theme.","Zammar, Guilherme; Meister, Henrique; Shah, Jatin; Phadtare, Amruta; Cofiel, Luciana; Pietrobon, Ricardo",PLoS One,1607
No evidence for the watching-eyes effect on human impulsivity,"People often become more altruistic when they think or feel that someone is watching them. Known as the ""watching-eyes effect,"" this is argued to be caused by the motivation to gain and maintain a positive social reputation as an altruistic individual (the ""reputation seeking"" mechanism). However, an alternative mechanism underlying the watching-eyes effect could be that people suppress their impulsive tendency to pursue benefit rather than increase their altruism, and this may lead to apparent increases in altruistic tendencies. This ""suppressing impulsivity"" mechanism is considered intrapersonal rather than socially mediated which is associated with ""reputation seeking."" We examined whether the suppressing impulsivity mechanism would be associated with the watching-eyes effect by measuring participants' impulsivity in the presence of watching-eyes stimuli. In a controlled experiment, we presented life-size pictures of human faces with a direct gaze on a monitor in front of participants taking part in a time-discounting task. Two types of faces, ""in-group"" (faces of participants' classmates) and ""out-group"" (unfamiliar faces) were presented to examine the effect of social attribution. We used a flower picture as a control stimulus. In the time-discounting task, participants chose one of two options: a small amount of money that they could get immediately or a larger amount of money that they could get after a given time interval. The results showed no significant difference in participants' time-discount rate regardless of the types of stimuli presented during the time-discount task. A post-task questionnaire confirmed that the participants were aware of the presented stimuli and revealed that they paid more attention to the in-group stimuli than to the out-group and flower stimuli, though this difference in attentive states had no effect on their impulsivity during the task. These results suggest that suppressing impulsivity is not a plausible mechanism for the watching-eyes effect. The null effect for the difference between the in-group and out-group stimuli also supports this conclusion. Thus, it is plausible that the watching-eyes effect is caused by the human tendency to boost social reputation and can be mediated by the social relationship with others. © 2018 Shinohara and Yamamoto.","Shinohara, A.; Yamamoto, S.",Front.

Avoiding overhead aversion in charity,"Donors tend to avoid charities that dedicate a high percentage of expenses to administrative and fundraising costs, limiting the ability of nonprofits to be effective. We propose a solution to this problem: Use donations from major philanthropists to cover overhead expenses and offer potential donors an overhead-free donation opportunity. A laboratory experiment testing this solution confirms that donations decrease when overhead increases, but only when donors pay for overhead themselves. In a field experiment with 40,000 potential donors, we compared the overhead-free solution with other common uses of initial donations. Consistent with prior research, informing donors that seed money has already been raised increases donations, as does a $1:$1 matching campaign. Our main result, however, clearly shows that informing potential donors that overhead costs are covered by an initial donation significantly increases the donation rate by 80% (or 94%) and total donations by 75% (or 89%) compared with the seed (or matching) approach.

Cooperation under the shadow of the future: Experimental evidence from infinitely repeated games,"While there is an extensive literature on the theory of infinitely repeated games, empirical evidence on how ""the shadow of the future"" affects behavior is scarce and inconclusive. I simulate infinitely repeated prisoner's dilemma games in the lab with a random continuation rule. The experimental design represents an improvement over the existing literature by including sessions with finite repeated games as controls and a large number of players per session (which allows for learning without contagion effects). I find that the shadow of the future matters not only by significantly reducing opportunistic behavior, but also because its impact closely follows theoretical predictions.","Pedro Dal, B.O.",Am.

Four avenues of normative influence: A research agenda for health promotion in low and mid-income countries,"Health promotion interventions in low and midincome countries (LMIC) are increasingly integrating strategies to change local social norms that sustain harmful practices. However, the literature on social norms and health in LMIC is still scarce. A well-known application of social norm theory in LMIC involves abandonment of female genital cutting (FGC) in West Africa. We argue that FGC is a special case because of its unique relationship between the norm and the practice; health promotion interventions would benefit from a wider understanding of how social norms can influence different types of health-related behaviors. We hypothesize that four factors shape the strength of a norm over a practice: (1) whether the practice is dependent or interdependent; (2) whether it is more or less detectable; (3) whether it is under the influence of distal or proximal norms; and (4) whether noncompliance is likely to result in sanctions. We look at each of these four factors in detail, and suggest that different relations between norms and a practice might require different programmatic solutions. Future findings that will confirm or contradict our hypothesis will be critical for effective health promotion interventions that aim to change harmful social norms in LMIC. © 2018 American Psychological Association.","Cislaghi, B.; Heise, L.",Health Psychol.,1612
Four-year-olds' strategic allocation of resources: Attempts to elicit reciprocation correlate negatively with spontaneous helping,"Behaviour benefitting others (prosocial behaviour) can be motivated by self-interested strategic concerns as well as by genuine concern for others. Even in very young children such behaviour can be motivated by concern for others, but whether it can be strategically motivated by self-interest is currently less clear. Here, children had to distribute resources in a game in which a rich but not a poor recipient could reciprocate. From four years of age participants strategically favoured the rich recipient, but only when recipients had stated an intention to reciprocate. Six- and eight-year-olds distributed more equally. Children allocating strategically to the rich recipient were less likely to help when an adult needed assistance but was not in a position to immediately reciprocate, demonstrating consistent cross-task individual differences in the extent to which social behaviour is self- versus other-oriented even in early childhood. By four years of age children are capable of strategically allocating resources to others as a tool to advance their own self-interest. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Kenward, B.; Hellmer, K.; Winter, L.S.; Eriksson, M.",Cognition,1613

Three Attempts to Replicate the Moral Licensing Effect,"The present work includes three attempts to replicate the moral licensing effect by Sachdeva, Iliev, and Medin (2009). The original authors found that writing about positive traits led to lower donations to charity and decreased cooperative behavior. The first two replication attempts (student samples, 95% power based on the initial findings, NStudy1 = 105, NStudy2 = 150), did not confirm the original results. The third replication attempt (MTurk sample, 95% power based on a meta-analysis on self-licensing, N = 940) also did not confirm the moral licensing effect. We conclude that (1) there is as of yet no strong support for the moral self-regulation framework proposed in Sachdeva et al. (2009) (2) the manipulation used is unlikely to induce moral licensing, and (3) studies on moral licensing should use a neutral control condition.

Fairness and trust in virtual environments: The effects of reputation,"Reputation supports pro-social behaviors in a variety of social settings and across different ages. When re-encounters are possible, developing a positive reputation can be a valuable asset that will result in better outcomes. However, in real life, cooperative acts are ambiguous and happen in noisy environments in which individuals can have multiple goals, visibility is reduced, and reputation systems may differ. This study examined how reputation within a virtual environment affects fairness in material allocations and trust in information exchange, in a three-actors interaction game in which each player had an incentive to deceive the others. We compared the results of two experimental conditions, one in which informers could be evaluated, and one without reputational opportunities. A reputational system appeared to enhance both trust and fairness even within a virtual environment under anonymous condition. We tested adolescents and adults finding that they were consistently more generous when visibility was increased, but they showed significantly different patterns in resources allocation and information exchange. Male and female participants, across ages, showed other interesting differences. These findings suggest that reputational effects increase fairness and trust even in a noisy, ambiguous and uncertain environment, but this effect is modulated by age and gender. © 2018 by the authors.","Duradoni, M.; Paolucci, M.; Bagnoli, F.; Guazzini, A.",Future Internet,1616

We first describe MTurk and its promise as a vehicle for performing low-cost and easy-to-field experiments. We then assess the internal and external validity of experiments performed using MTurk, employing a framework that can be used to evaluate other subject pools. We first investigate the characteristics of samples drawn from the MTurk population. We show that respondents recruited in this manner are often more representative of the U.S. population than in-person convenience samples-the modal sample in published experimental political science-but less representative than subjects in Internet-based panels or national probability samples. Finally, we replicate important published experimental work using MTurk samples. © The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Political Methodology.

Evidence for strategic cooperation in humans,"Humans may cooperate strategically, cooperating at higher levels than expected from their short-term interests, to try and stimulate others to cooperate. To test this hypothesis, we experimentally manipulated the extent an individual’s behaviour is known to others, and hence whether or not strategic cooperation is possible. In contrast with many previous studies, we avoided confounding factors by preventing individuals from learning during the game about either pay-offs or about how other individuals behave. We found clear evidence for strategic cooperators—just telling some individuals that their groupmates would be informed about their behaviour led to them tripling their initial level of cooperation, from 17 to 50%. We also found that many individuals play as if they do not understand the game, and their presence obscures the detection of strategic cooperation. Identifying such players allowed us to detect and study strategic motives for cooperation in novel, more powerful, ways. © 2017 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Effects of a prosocial televised example on children's helping,"The possibility that regularly broadcast entertainment television programs can facilitate prosocial behavior in children was investigated. Thirty first-grade children, 15 boys and 15 girls, were individually exposed to one of three half-hour television programs: a program from the Lassie series which included a dramatic example of a boy helping a dog, a program from the Lassie series devoid of such an example, or a program from the family situation comedy series, the Brady Bunch. The effects of the programming were assessed by presenting each child with a situation that required him to choose between continuing to play a game for self-gain and helping puppies in distress. Children exposed to the Lassie program with the helping scene helped for significantly more time than those exposed to either of the other programs. © 1975.","Sprafkin, J.N.; Liebert, R.M.; Poulos, R.W.",J.

A range of kindness activities boost happiness,"This experiment investigates the effects of a seven-day kindness activities intervention on changes in subjective happiness. The study was designed to test whether performing different types of kindness activities had differential effects on happiness. Our recent systematic review and meta-analysis of the psychological effects of kindness (Curry, et al. 2018) revealed that performing acts of kindness boosts happiness and well-being. However, we noted in that review that rarely had researchers specifically compared the effects of kindness to different recipients, such as to friends or to strangers. Thus in a single factorial design (n=683) we compare acts of kindness to strong social ties, weak social ties, novel acts of self kindness, and observing acts of kindness, against a no acts control group. The results indicate that performing kindness activities for seven days increases happiness. In addition, we report a positive correlation between the number of kind acts and increases in happiness. Neither effect differed across the experimental the groups, suggesting that kindness to strong ties, to weak ties, and to self, as well as observing acts of kindness, have equally positive effects on happiness.","Rowland, Lee; Curry, Oliver Scott",J.

"Unresolved heterogeneity in meta-analysis: Combined construct invalidity, confounding, and other challenges to understanding mean effect sizes","We examined the interplay between how communication researchers use meta-analyses to make claims and the prevalence, causes, and implications of unresolved heterogeneous findings. Heterogeneous findings can result from substantive moderators, methodological artifacts, and combined construct invalidity. An informal content analysis of meta-analyses published in four elite communication journals revealed that unresolved between-study effect heterogeneity was ubiquitous. Communication researchers mainly focus on computing mean effect sizes, to the exclusion of how effect sizes in primary studies are distributed and of what might be driving effect size distributions. We offer four recommendations for future meta-analyses. Researchers are advised to be more diligent and sophisticated in testing for heterogeneity. We encourage greater description of how effects are distributed, coupled with greater reliance on graphical displays. We council greater recognition of combined construct invalidity and advocate for content expertise. Finally, we endorse greater awareness and improved tests for publication bias and questionable research practices. © The Author(s) 2020.

Systematic review of perioperative and quality-of-life outcomes following surgical management of localised renal cancer,"Partial nephrectomy provided significantly better preservation of renal function than radical nephrectomy. For tumours where partial nephrectomy was not technically feasible, there was no evidence that alternative procedures or techniques were better than laparoscopic radical nephrectomy for perioperative or quality of life outcomes. XCM: This review had a clear research question and specified inclusion criteria in enough detail to enable independent researchers to repeat the review. Databases were searched without language restrictions and attempts were made to find unpublished studies, which reduced risks of language and publication biases. Studies were selected by two people independently to reduce errors/bias; no such methods were reported for data extraction and quality assessment. The narrative synthesis and presentation of results on forest plots but without pooled values seemed appropriate given the differences between the studies. The authors' conclusions do not fully reflect the results of the review and may not be reliable due to the poor quality of the evidence and discrepancies in the reporting. XIM: Practice: The authors stated that when making treatment decisions, perioperative and quality of life outcomes should be considered alongside oncological outcomes. Partial nephrectomy should be the preferred method for tumours where oncological outcomes had been shown to be equivalent among interventions.Research: The authors stated that systematic and methodical approaches were needed when studying complex surgical procedures. Future studies should measure quality of life and perioperative outcomes.","MacLennan, S; Imamura, M; Lapitan, M C; Omar, M I; Lam, T B; Hilvano-Cabungcal, A M; Royle, P; Stewart, F; MacLennan, G; MacLennan, S J; Dahm, P; Canfield, S E; McClinton, S; Griffiths, T R; Ljungberg, B; N'Dow J; UCAN Systematic Review Reference Group; EAU Renal Cancer Guideline Panel",,1623
Antecedents of Knowledge Sharing Behavior among Nurses: Towards Research Agenda,"This paper attempts to propose presenteeism, altruism and virtual communities of practices (CoP) as the main antecedents to facilitate knowledge sharing behavior (KSB) among nurses. A systematic review technique is adopted to formulate a conceptual framework that integrates the Social Cognitive theory, Social Capital theory and Theory of Planned Behavior. This paper suggests the importance of KSB and its antecedents from the perspective of nursing. Presenteeism in this study is generated by positive attitude to implement tasks by nurses. Indeed, their essence of knowledge and caring has led this study to propose altruism and informal communication tool (facebook) as factors that can influence KSB.

Empathy: A motivated account,"Empathy features a tension between automaticity and context dependency. On the one hand, people often take on each other's internal states reflexively and outside of awareness. On the other hand, empathy shifts with characteristics of empathizers and situations. These 2 characteristics of empathy can be reconciled by acknowledging the key role of motivation in driving people to avoid or approach engagement with others' emotions. In particular, at least 3 phenomena —suffering, material costs, and interference with competition—motivate people to avoid empathy, and at least 3 phenomena —positive affect, affiliation, and social desirability—motivate them to approach empathy. Would-be empathizers carry out these motives through regulatory strategies including situation selection, attentional modulation, and appraisal, which alter the course of empathic episodes. Interdisciplinary evidence highlights the motivated nature of empathy, and a motivated model holds wide-ranging implications for basic theory, models of psychiatric illness, and intervention efforts to maximize empathy. © 2016 APA.","Jamil, Z.",Psychol.

Testing the two sides of indirect reciprocity in tufted capuchin monkeys,"We addressed two different aspects of indirect reciprocity in tufted capuchin monkeys (Sapajus spp.) studying two common cooperative behaviours, grooming and food sharing. In an observational study, we tested whether capuchin monkeys were more likely to groom an individual that had just groomed a group mate than an individual that had not groomed anybody. In an experimental study, we tested whether capuchin monkeys were more likely to share their food with a partner when in the presence of a bystander (or of an image of the eyes of a conspecific) than when alone with their partner. In the observational study, we found an increase in the likelihood of receiving grooming after giving grooming, but this effect seemed to depend on social facilitation rather than on indirect reciprocity, as we found a similar effect after receiving (rather than giving) grooming. In the experimental study, the presence of a bystander or of an image of eyes did not affect the amount of food transferred to a group mate. Overall, these results suggest capuchin monkeys do not engage in indirect reciprocity. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Schino, G.; Boggiani, L.; Mortelliti, A.; Pinzaglia, M.; Addessi, E.",Behav.

Social preferences across different populations: Meta-analyses on the ultimatum game and dictator game,"We perform meta-regressions on a single database containing 96 observations of simple ultimatum games and 144 observations of simple dictator games to disentangle the fairness hypothesis based on the degree of economic development of a country. According to the fairness hypothesis, offers in the two games should not differ if they were motivated by a subject's fairness concerns. Using the difference across countries between offers in ultimatum and dictator games, we address the effect of being exposed to the market mechanism on pure fairness concerns and other-regarding, expectations-driven fairness. Our results show in particular that the lower the level of economic development in a country, the less likely the rejection of the fairness hypothesis. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Cochard, F.; Le Gallo, J.; Georgantzis, N.; Tisserand, J.-C.",J.

"We, Them, and It: Dictator Game Offers Depend on Hierarchical Social Status, Artificial Intelligence, and Social Dominance","We investigated the influence of social status on behavior in a modified dictator game (DG). Since the DG contains an inherent dominance gradient, we examined the relationship between dictator decisions and recipient status, which was operationalized by three social identities and an artificial intelligence (AI). Additionally, we examined the predictive value of social dominance orientation (SDO) on the behavior of dictators toward the different social and non-social hierarchical recipients. A multilevel model analysis showed that recipients with the same status as the dictator benefited the most and the artificial intelligence the least. Furthermore, SDO, regardless of social status, predicted behavior toward recipients in such a way that higher dominance was associated with lower dictator offers. In summary, participants treated other persons of higher and lower status equally, those of equal status better and, above all, an algorithm worst. The large proportion of female participants and the limited variance of SDO should be taken into account with regard to the results of individual differences in SDO. © Copyright © 2020 Weiß, Rodrigues, Paelecke and Hewig.","Weiß, M.; Rodrigues, J.; Paelecke, M.; Hewig, J.",Front.

Compassion Training Alters Altruism and Neural Responses to Suffering,"Compassion is a key motivator of altruistic behavior, but little is known about individuals' capacity to cultivate compassion through training. We examined whether compassion may be systematically trained by testing whether (a) short-term compassion training increases altruistic behavior and (b) individual differences in altruism are associated with training-induced changes in neural responses to suffering. In healthy adults, we found that compassion training increased altruistic redistribution of funds to a victim encountered outside of the training context. Furthermore, increased altruistic behavior after compassion training was associated with altered activation in brain regions implicated in social cognition and emotion regulation, including the inferior parietal cortex and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and in DLPFC connectivity with the nucleus accumbens. These results suggest that compassion can be cultivated with training and that greater altruistic behavior may emerge from increased engagement of neural systems implicated in understanding the suffering of other people, executive and emotional control, and reward processing. © The Author(s) 2013.","Weng, H.Y.; Fox, A.S.; Shackman, A.J.; Stodola, D.E.; Caldwell, J.Z.K.; Olson, M.C.; Rogers, G.M.; Davidson, R.J.",Psychol.

Artificial cervical and lumbar disc implants: a review of the literature,"1. The concept of establishing spinal pain as being caused by Degenerative Disc Disease is still problematic and unclear.2. Artificial intervertebral disc has been in use for almost two decades in mainly European and some Asian countries3. As of December 29, 2003, there are two artificial disc implants that have been licensed for use in Canada. These products include SB Charite III for lumbar disc and Bryan Cervical Disc Prosthesis.4. Recently, SB Charite III has been approved by the US FDA for use in treating pain associated with lumbar spinal disc degeneration. The approval was given, based on the US FDA investigational device exemption multicenter randomized controlled trial study conducted by the manufacturer. It should be noted that our appraisal of this study suggests some areas of concern.5. At present, Prosthetic Disc Nucleus is under investigation in Canada and the US.6. Despite the claims that Bryan's cervical disc has been implanted in over 5000 patients worldwide, to date, there are only 9 published papers on the application of Bryan's cervical disc. These publications are all case series types (level 4-5 evidence).7. The insertion of artificial cervical disc has many technical issues and is not without risk. Complications, including the need for re-surgery, device migration and physiological bodily response to the wear debris of the implant have been reported.8. Due to the lack of direct comparison published data on cervical disc prosthesis against, for example, discectomy with or without fusion, as well as long term follow-up (> 10 years) safety and efficacy of artificial cervical disc still cannot be established. It is expected that, in the near future, short-term randomized controlled trial data will be available from the US FDA Device Exemption Study results.9. As such, at present, artificial intervertebral disc, in particular artificial cervical discs, should be considered still at an experimental stage.",WCB Evidence Based Practice Group,,1632
"The eyes have it: The neuroethology, function and evolution of social gaze","Gaze is an important component of social interaction. The function, evolution and neurobiology of gaze processing are therefore of interest to a number of researchers. This review discusses the evolutionary role of social gaze in vertebrates (focusing on primates), and a hypothesis that this role has changed substantially for primates compared to other animals. This change may have been driven by morphological changes to the face and eyes of primates, limitations in the facial anatomy of other vertebrates, changes in the ecology of the environment in which primates live, and a necessity to communicate information about the environment, emotional and mental states. The eyes represent different levels of signal value depending on the status, disposition and emotional state of the sender and receiver of such signals. There are regions in the monkey and human brain which contain neurons that respond selectively to faces, bodies and eye gaze. The ability to follow another individual's gaze direction is affected in individuals with autism and other psychopathological disorders, and after particular localized brain lesions. The hypothesis that gaze following is 'hard-wired' in the brain, and may be localized within a circuit linking the superior temporal sulcus, amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex is discussed.

The Sense of Being Watched Is Modulated by Arousal and Duration of the Perceptual Episode,"The mere presence of a depiction of eyes can elicit a sense of being watched in the perceiver. To this date, the factors affecting the intensity of this sense of being watched, however, have not been investigated. In the present experiment, we tested the impact of two potentially relevant variables: arousal (manipulated using specific musical pieces) and duration of the perceptual episode (manipulated using presentation times of 200 ms and 10 s, respectively). We asked participants to report how intensely they felt being watched while we exposed them to various observation cues ranging from human eyes to surveillance cameras. We found that, on average, reported intensities were higher if participants were in a state of relatively higher arousal and if the perceptual episode during which the respective observation cues were presented lasted long enough (10 s) to allow more than a first glance.

On having very long arms: how the availability of technological means affects moral cognition,"Modern technological means allow for meaningful interaction across arbitrary distances, while human morality evolved in environments in which individuals needed to be spatially close in order to interact. We investigate how people integrate knowledge about modern technology with their ancestral moral dispositions to help relieve nearby suffering. Our first study establishes that spatial proximity between an agent's means of helping and the victims increases people's judgement of helping obligations, even if the agent is constantly far personally. We then report and meta-analyse 20 experiments elucidating the cognitive mechanisms behind this effect, which include inferences of increased efficaciousness and personal involvement. Implications of our findings for the scientific understanding of ancestral moral dispositions in modern environments are discussed, as well as suggestions for how these insights might be exploited to increase charitable giving. Our meta-analysis provides a practical example for how aggregating across all available data, including failed replication attempts, allows conclusions that could not be supported in single experiments.

"It's harder to push, when I have to push hard—physical exertion and fatigue changes reasoning and decision-making on hypothetical moral dilemmas in males","Despite the prevalence of physical exertion and fatigue during military, firefighting and disaster medicine operations, sports or even daily life, their acute effects on moral reasoning and moral decision-making have never been systematically investigated. To test the effects of physical exertion on moral reasoning and moral decision-making, we administered a moral dilemma task to 32 male participants during a moderate or high intensity cycling intervention. Participants in the high intensity cycling group tended to show more non-utilitarian reasoning and more non-utilitarian decision-making on impersonal but not on personal dilemmas than participants in the moderate intensity cycling group. Exercise-induced exertion and fatigue, thus, shifted moral reasoning and moral decision-making in a non-utilitarian rather than utilitarian direction, presumably due to an exercise-induced limitation of prefrontally mediated executive resources that are more relevant for utilitarian than non-utilitarian reasoning and decision-making. © 2018 Weippert, Rickler, Kluck, Behrens, Bastian, Mau-Moeller, Bruhn and Lischke.","Weippert, M.; Rickler, M.; Kluck, S.; Behrens, K.; Bastian, M.; Mau-Moeller, A.; Bruhn, S.; Lischke, A.",Front.

Deception under time pressure: Conscious decision or a problem of awareness?,"Time is a crucial determinant of deception, since some misreporting opportunities come as a surprise and require an intuitive decision while others allow for extensive reflection time. To be able to pursue a deceptive strategy, however, a subject must be aware of the misreporting opportunity. This paper provides experimental evidence on the role of the time dimension for dishonest decision-making and for the cognition process of the chance to deceive. We conduct a laboratory experiment of self-serving deceptive behavior which combines two exogenously varied levels of reflection time with a cognition process about the deception opportunity. We find that time pressure leads to more honesty compared to sufficient contemplation time. More importantly, decomposing misreporting into its two components, i.e., the cognition process of the misreporting opportunity and the conscious decision to misreport, reveals that more reflection time increases awareness of the misreporting opportunity. However, more time has no effect on the conscious decision of whether to misreport or not. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Lohse, T.; Simon, S.A.; Konrad, K.A.",J. Econ. Behav. Organ.,1640
Examining charitable giving in real-world online donations,"The current study uses big data to study prosocial behavior by analyzing donations made on the GoFundMe platform. In a dataset of more than $44 million in online donations, we find that 21% were made while opting to be anonymous to the public, with survey results indicating that 11% of these anonymous donations (2.3% of all donations) are not attributable to any egoistic goal. Additionally, we find that donors gave significantly more to recipients who had the same last name as them. We find evidence that men and women donated more when more donors of the opposite sex were visible on the screen at the time of donating. Our results suggest that men and women were both significantly affected by the average donation amounts visible at the time of their decisions, and men were influenced more. We find that women expressed significantly more empathy than men in messages accompanying their donations. © 2019, The Author(s).","Sisco, M.R.; Weber, E.U.",Nat. Commun.,1641
What type of nonprofit organization is preferred in government contracting in China?,"Government contracting with nonprofit organizations in service delivery has become a widespread practice in the public administration landscape. This research explores what kinds of nonprofits are more likely to receive government funding for service delivery. Viewing nonprofits’ pursuit of government funding as an interorganizational effort, we examine the contextual and organizational factors that influence nonprofits’ receipt of government funding. Using the data collected from a nationwide survey of Chinese nonprofits, we find a close contractual relationship between government and nonprofits. Further analysis suggests that policy advocacy, board co-optation, external competition, and organizational formalization have positive impacts on leveraging government funding, while interorganizational collaboration and organizational professionalization do not appear to play a significant role. To our knowledge, this study represents the first nationwide survey research on government–nonprofit contracting in China. The findings expand the literature by adding new empirical evidence from an authoritarian context. Points for practitioners: This study examines the contextual and organizational factors affecting Chinese nonprofit organizations’ receipt of purchase-of-service contracts from government. The results indicate that nonprofit organizations engaging in more policy advocacy activities, having more people with government working experience on governing boards, facing stronger competition in resource acquisition and service delivery from operating environments, and embracing more formal structures and procedures in organizational operations would receive more government contracts. © The Author(s) 2019.","Dong, Q.; Lu, J.",Int.

Passing the buck to the wealthier: Reference-dependent standards of generosity,"Who is expected to donate to charity, and how much should they give? Intuitively, the less financially constrained someone is the more they should give. How then do people evaluate who is constrained and who has money to spare? We argue that perceptions of spare money are reference-dependent with respect to one's current self: those who earn more than oneself are perceived as having an abundance of spare money and thus as ethically obligated to donate. However, those higher earners themselves report having little to spare, and thus apply lower donation standards to themselves. Moreover, a meta-analysis of our file-drawer reveals an asymmetry: individuals overestimate the spare money of higher earners but estimate the scant spare money of lower earners more accurately. Across all incomes assessed, people “pass the buck” to wealthier others (or to their future wealthier selves), who in turn, “pass the buck” to even wealthier others. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Berman, J.Z.; Bhattacharjee, A.; Small, D.A.; Zauberman, G.",Organ.

"Personality, antisocial behavior, and aggression: A meta-analytic review","Purpose: Although the relationship between personality and antisocial behaviors has been widely examined and empirically supported in the psychological literature, relatively few efforts to study this relationship have appeared in mainstream criminology. Materials and methods: The current study focuses on the domains and facets from the Five-Factor Model of personality, and how they are related to antisocial and aggressive behaviors. Results: The meta-analytic findings indicate that the higher-order traits of Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, and Neuroticism demonstrate the most consistent relationships with these outcomes. At the lower-order trait level, straightforwardness, compliance, and altruism from Agreeableness, deliberation from Conscientiousness, angry hostility from Neuroticism, and warmth from Extraversion were among the strongest correlates. Conclusion: The findings are consistent with previous meta-analytic studies, thus providing compelling support for their utility in understanding antisocial and aggressive behavior. As such, they should be afforded greater theoretical and empirical attention within criminology.

"Trust, Punishment, and Cooperation Across 18 Societies: A Meta-Analysis","Punishment promotes contributions to public goods, but recent evidence suggests that its effectiveness varies across societies. Prior theorizing suggests that cross-societal differences in trust play a key role in determining the effectiveness of punishment, as a form of social norm enforcement, to promote cooperation. One line of reasoning is that punishment promotes cooperation in low-trust societies, primarily because people in such societies expect their fellow members to contribute only if there are strong incentives to do so. Yet another line of reasoning is that high trust makes punishment work, presumably because in high-trust societies people may count on each other to make contributions to public goods and also enforce norm violations by punishing free riders. This poses a puzzle of punishment: Is punishment more effective in promoting cooperation in high- or low-trust societies? In the present article, we examine this puzzle of punishment in a quantitative review of 83 studies involving 7,361 participants across 18 societies that examine the impact of punishment on cooperation in a public goods dilemma. The findings provide a clear answer: Punishment more strongly promotes cooperation in societies with high trust rather than low trust.","Balliet, Daniel; Van Lange, Paul A M",Perspect. Psychol.

"Trustworthiness and competitive altruism can also solve the ""tragedy of the commons""","The benefits of a good reputation can help explain why some individuals are willing to be altruistic in situations where they will not receive direct benefits. Recent experiments on indirect reciprocity have shown that when people stand to benefit from having a good reputation, they are more altruistic towards groups and charities. However, it is unknown whether indirect reciprocity is the only thing that can cause such an effect. Individuals may be altruistic because it will make them more trustworthy. In this study, I show that participants in a cooperative group game contribute more to their group when they expect to play a dyadic trust game afterwards, and that participants do tend to trust altruistic individuals more than nonaltruistic individuals. I also included a condition where participants had to choose only one person to trust (instead of being able to trust all players) in the dyadic trust game that followed the cooperative group game, and contributions towards the group were maintained best in this condition. This provides some evidence that competition for scarce reputational benefits can help maintain cooperative behaviour because of competitive altruism. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Social exchange and reciprocity: Confusion or a heuristic?,"We propose that a ""social exchange heuristic"" is as important as the cheater detection mechanism for attaining mutual cooperation in social exchange. The social exchange heuristic prompts people to perceive a mixed-motive situation, such as the Prisoner's Dilemma (PD), as an Assurance Game (AG) situation in which cooperation is a personally better choice than defection insofar as the partner is cooperating as well. We demonstrate the operation of the social exchange heuristic through a comparison of the ordinary one-shot, simultaneous PD with the one-shot, sequential PD. Participants in the current experiments, involving a total of 261 volunteers, committed a logical error in the direction of favoring mutual cooperation as the situation involved more serious consequences. This result strongly suggests the operation of a domain specific ""bias"" that encourages pursuit of mutual cooperation in social exchange. © 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.

Cooperation through indirect reciprocity: Image scoring or standing strategy?,"Theorists have only recently shown that cooperation through indirect reciprocity can evolve. The first modelling approach favoured a mechanism called image scoring. Helping someone increases one's image score, whereas refusing to help reduces it. The evolutionary outcome was a discriminator image scoring strategy that helps everybody who has, for example, a positive image score. Two experimental studies with humans found results that were compatible with discriminator image scoring. However, a new analysis of other theorists, based on another population structure, has cast doubts on the evolutionary stability of strategies using the recipient's score as a sole basis for decision. The new theoretical study confirmed that a strategy aiming at 'good standing' has superior properties and easily beats image scoring. An individual loses good standing by failing to help a recipient in good standing, whereas failing to help recipients who lack good standing does not damage the standing of a potential donor (but would reduce his image score). The present empirical study with 23 groups of seven human subjects each was designed for distinguishing between the two proposed mechanisms experimentally. The results differed strongly from standing strategies, which might demand too much working memory capacity, but were compatible with image scoring or a similar strategy to a large extent. Furthermore, donors of constant 'NO players' compensated for their refusing to help these players by being more generous to others.","Milinski, M.; Semmann, D.; Bakker, T.C.M.; Krambeck, H.-J.",Proc.

Yet, for many of them, soliciting adequate resources to carry out their mandates is a continuing struggle. Confronted with a growing need for their services, fierce competition from other charities, and shrinking support from government agencies, charities may turn to marketers for help in developing effective promotional strategies. Unfortunately, marketing literature is unable to provide meaningful guidance because scant research attention has hampered a fuller understanding of why people help. The authors integrate relevant research in marketing, economics, sociology, and social psychology to advance theoretical understanding of helping behavior.

Systematic review and meta-analysis of Altruistic and Game-playing love (Revisión sistemática y meta-análisis del amor Altruista y Lúdico),"This systematic review aimed to find attitudes towards Altruistic and Game-playing love styles across individualistic and collectivistic cultures. Addressing major moderators concerning Altruistic and Game-playing love styles are the secondary objectives of this review. This review included 102 articles comprising samples from 37 countries (N = 41,997). The findings of this meta-analysis show that there is a collectivistic and individualistic difference in Game-playing but not in the Altruistic love style. Collectivistic and individualistic cultures, on average, demonstrate the same perception concerning the Altruistic love style, whereas collectivistic culture shows the Game-playing love style more strongly. To explain the role of moderators in key measures, the subgroup analysis and meta-regression show that both Game-playing and Altruistic love styles decline by increasing the length of the relationship. Likewise, having children affects these love styles such that the Altruistic love style is improved and the Game-playing love style is reduced by the presence of children in families. © 2021 Fundacion Infancia y Aprendizaje.","Dabiriyan-Tehrani, H.; Yamini, S.",Estud.

Using the strategy method, allows us to explore the motivations leading to those differences.

We assessed study bias using the EPOC checklist and the quality of the reported intervention using a subset of SQUIRE 1.0 standards. RESULTS: Of the 220 studies meeting QIC criteria, 64 met EPOC study design standards for inclusion. There were 10 cluster randomised controlled trials, 24 controlled before-after studies and 30 interrupted time series studies. QICs encompassed a broad range of clinical settings, topics and populations ranging from neonates to the elderly. Few reports fully described QIC implementation and methods, intensity of activities, degree of site engagement and important contextual factors. By care setting, an improvement was reported for one or more of the study's primary effect measures in 83% of the studies (32/39 (82%) hospital based, 17/20 (85%) ambulatory care, 3/4 nursing home and a sole ambulance QIC). Eight studies described persistence of the intervention effect 6 months to 2 years after the end of the collaborative. Collaboratives reporting success generally addressed relatively straightforward aspects of care, had a strong evidence base and noted a clear evidence-practice gap in an accepted clinical pathway or guideline. CONCLUSIONS: QICs have been adopted widely as an approach to shared learning and improvement in healthcare. Overall, the QICs included in this review reported significant improvements in targeted clinical processes and patient outcomes. These reports are encouraging, but most be interpreted cautiously since fewer than a third met established quality and reporting criteria, and publication bias is likely.","Wells, Susan; Tamir, Orly; Gray, Jonathon; Naidoo, Dhevaksha; Bekhit, Mark; Goldmann, Don",BMJ Qual.

Being Watched by Anthropomorphized Objects Affects Charitable Donation in Religious People,"This study assessed the effect of bottom-up visual cues—the cues of being watched—from anthropomorphized (face-like) everyday objects on religious people's prosocial behavior. As religious people are more likely than less-religious people to perceive faces in everyday objects and as perception of face-like objects promotes prosociality, it was expected that religious people would become more prosocial when they perceived face-like objects. To test the hypothesis, the study replicated a past finding in a Japanese sample in which religious people tended to perceive a face in everyday objects. Next, results showed that the decision to donate in religious people (compared to less-religious people) was increased when a face-like object was displayed with charitable appeals. This effect was not observed with a non-face-like object. The current study indicates that interaction with the surrounding environment plays an important role in motivating prosocial behavior among religious people. © 2017 Japanese Psychological Association.

The effect of direct and indirect monitoring on generosity among preschoolers,"The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of direct and indirect monitoring on generosity among five-year-old preschoolers and to reveal the primary motivation for their generosity. Forty-two preschoolers completed one-shot dictator games in Condition 1 while being monitored by the experimenter (the direct monitoring condition). In Condition 2, an image of staring eyes was displayed on the computer monitor (the indirect monitoring condition). In Condition 3, the computer monitor showed a picture of flowers (the non-monitoring condition). The results showed that while there was no difference between the mean levels of allocation in the indirect and non-monitoring conditions, the mean level of allocation in the direct monitoring condition was significantly higher than in the non-monitoring condition. These results showed that five-year-old preschoolers concerned with being monitored by, and receiving direct responses from, others tend to be more generous. © 2015, Macmillan Publishers Limited.

The donor is in the details,"Recent research finds that people respond more generously to individual victims described in detail than to equivalent statistical victims described in general terms. We propose that this "" identified victim effect"" is one manifestation of a more general phenomenon: a positive influence of tangible information on generosity. In three experiments, we find evidence for an "" identified intervention effect""; providing tangible details about a charity's interventions significantly increases donations to that charity. Although previous work described sympathy as the primary mediator between tangible information and giving, current mediational analyses show that the influence of tangible details can operate through donors' perception that their contribution will have impact. Taken together with past work, the results suggest that tangible information of many types promotes generosity and can do so either via sympathy or via perceived impact. The ability of tangible information to increase impact points to new ways for charities to encourage generosity. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.","Cryder, C.E.; Loewenstein, G.; Scheines, R.",Organ. Behav. Hum.

Laparoscopic versus open nephrectomy for live kidney donors,"BACKGROUND: Waiting lists for kidney transplantation continue to grow and live organ donation has become more important as the number of brain stem dead cadaveric organ donors continues to fall. The major disincentive to potential kidney donors is the pain and morbidity associated with open surgery. OBJECTIVES: To identify the benefits and harms of using laparoscopic compared to open nephrectomy techniques to recover kidneys from live organ donors. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the online databases CENTRAL (in The Cochrane Library 2010, Issue 2), MEDLINE (January 1966 to January 2010) and EMBASE (January 1980 to January 2010) and handsearched textbooks and reference lists. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials comparing laparoscopic donor nephrectomy (LDN) with open donor nephrectomy (ODN). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts for eligibility, assessed study quality, and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information where necessary. MAIN RESULTS: Six studies were identified that randomised 596 live kidney donors to either LDN or ODN arms. All studies were assessed as having low or unclear risk of bias for selection bias, allocation bias, incomplete outcome data and selective reporting bias. Four of six studies had high risk of bias for blinding. Various different combinations of techniques were used in each study, resulting in heterogeneity in the results. The conversion rate from LDN to ODN ranged from 1% to 1.8%. LDN was generally found to be associated with reduced analgesia use, shorter hospital stay, and faster return to normal physical functioning. The extracted kidney was exposed to longer warm ischaemia periods (2 to 17 minutes) with no associated short-term consequences. ODN was associated with shorter duration of procedure. For those outcomes that could be meta-analysed there were no significant differences between LDN or ODN for perioperative complications (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.47 to 4.59), reoperations (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.09 to 3.64), early graft loss (RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.06 to 1.48), delayed graft function (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.52 to 2.30), acute rejection (RR 1.41, 95 % CI 0.87 to 2.27), ureteric complications (RR 1.51, 95% CI 0.69 to 3.31), kidney function at one year (SMD 0.15, 95% CI -0.11 to 0.41) or graft loss at one year (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.15 to 3.85). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: LDN is associated with less pain compared with open surgery; however, there are equivalent numbers of complications and occurrences of perioperative events that require further intervention. Kidneys obtained using LDN procedures were exposed to longer warm ischaemia periods than ODN-acquired grafts, although this has not been reported as being associated with short-term consequences.","Wilson, Colin H; Sanni, Aliu; Rix, David A; Soomro, Naeem A",Cochrane Database Syst.

Decomposing desert and tangibility effects in a charitable giving experiment,"Several papers have documented that when subjects play with standard laboratory ""endowments"" they make less self-interested choices than when they use money they have either earned through a laboratory task or brought from outside the lab. In the context of a charitable giving experiment we decompose this into two common artifacts of the laboratory: the intangibility of money (or experimental currency units) promised on a computer screen relative to cash in hand, and the distinct treatment of random ""windfall"" gains relative to earned money. While both effects are found to be significant in non-parametric tests, the former effect, which has been neglected in previous studies, has a stronger impact on total donations, while the latter effect has a greater impact on the probability of donating. These results have clear implications for experimental design, and also suggest that the availability of more abstract payment methods may increase other-regarding behavior in the field. © 2011 Economic Science Association.","Reinstein, D.; Riener, G.",Exp.

The role of eye gaze during natural social interactions in typical and autistic people,"Social interactions involve complex exchanges of a variety of social signals, such as gaze, facial expressions, speech and gestures. Focusing on the dual function of eye gaze, this review explores how the presence of an audience, communicative purpose and temporal dynamics of gaze allow interacting partners to achieve successful communication. First, we focus on how being watched modulates social cognition and behavior. We then show that the study of interpersonal gaze processing, particularly gaze temporal dynamics, can provide valuable understanding of social behavior in real interactions. We propose that the Interpersonal Gaze Processing model, which combines both sensing and signaling functions of eye gaze, provides a framework to make sense of gaze patterns in live interactions. Finally, we discuss how autistic individuals process the belief in being watched and interpersonal dynamics of gaze, and suggest that systematic manipulation of factors modulating gaze signaling can reveal which aspects of social eye gaze are challenging in autism. © 2019 Cañigueral and Hamilton.","Cañigueral, R.; Hamilton, A.F.C.",Front.

Altered economic decision-making in abstinent heroin addicts: Evidence from the ultimatum game,"Background: The development and persistence of drug addiction has been suggested to involve decision-making deficits. The Ultimatum Game is a widely used economic decision-making paradigm that illustrates the tension between financial self-interest and fairness motives. The behavior of responders in the Ultimatum Game has been associated with emotional reactions and cognitive control abilities, both of which are dysregulated in drug addicts. In this study, we investigated whether this economic decision-making process that involves considerations of social norms is affected by heroin addiction. Methods: Heroin addicts (n = 17) and demographically matched healthy control subjects (n = 18) were recruited to play the part of responders in the Ultimatum Game, during which they decided to accept or reject the monetary offers proposed by strangers. The offers were manipulated by varying the stake sizes and fairness scales. The rejection rates of all of the offer categories, response times, fairness judgments, and impulsivity were compared between heroin addicts and healthy controls. Results: Compared with healthy subjects, the rejection rates of most unfair offers in the Ultimatum Game were significantly higher under low-offer-size conditions among heroin addicts. In contrast, the most unfair offers were more likely to be accepted by heroin addicts in the high-offer-size condition than by healthy subjects. The ratings of unfairness were equal in both conditions although the rejection rates were different. Heroin addicts had higher scores on BIS attentional/cognitive impulsivity and non-planning impulsivity, but not in motor impulsivity. Rejection rates to most unfair offers under low-offer-size conditions significantly correlated with score on BIS non-planning impulsivity and total score of impulsivity. Conclusions: Heroin addicts differentially responded under different stake-level conditions in the Ultimatum Game, with emotional impulses in low-offer-size conditions and selfish motives in the face of high monetary reward. These findings indicate that Ultimatum Game may be associated with heroin addiction and provide a productive new target for enhancing treatment for heroin addiction. © 2016.","Hou, Y.; Zhao, L.; Yao, Q.; Ding, L.",Neurosci.

The cost-effectiveness of screening the U.S. blood supply for West Nile virus,"BACKGROUND: The spread of West Nile virus across North America and evidence of transmission by transfusion prompted the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to encourage the development of methods to screen the blood supply. OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of nucleic acid amplification testing for West Nile virus in the U.S. blood supply. DESIGN: Markov cohort simulation. DATA SOURCES: Outcome probabilities estimated from nucleic acid testing done for West Nile virus in 2003, data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and published literature. Costs were taken from an economic study of West Nile virus infection and from estimated test costs. TARGET POPULATIONS: Transfusion recipients, 60 years of age or older, with and without underlying immunocompromise. TIME HORIZON: Lifetime. PERSPECTIVE: Societal. INTERVENTIONS: The authors compared 6 strategies, taking into consideration minipool (pools of 6 to 16 donations) versus individual donation testing, and the geographic and seasonal nature of West Nile virus activity. OUTCOME MEASURES: Costs and effects of each strategy based on the prevention of transfusion-transmitted West Nile virus. RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: The cost-effectiveness of annual, national minipool testing was 483,000 dollars per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), whereas the cost-effectiveness of annual, national individual donation testing was 897,000 dollars/QALY. The cost-effectiveness of targeted individual donation testing in an area experiencing an outbreak coupled with minipool testing elsewhere was 520,000 dollars/QALY. RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: In 1-way analyses, the most important influences were the prevalence of West Nile virus and the cost of minipool testing and individual donation testing. The 95% range of results from probabilistic sensitivity analysis for targeted individual donation testing was 256,000 dollars to 1,044,000 dollars/QALY. LIMITATIONS: The outcomes of West Nile virus infection were based on data from the general population rather than from the population who received transfusions. The results are most useful in the context of geographically focused outbreaks of West Nile virus infection. CONCLUSIONS: Using targeted individual donation testing to interdict blood donations that are positive for the West Nile virus is relatively cost-effective but is highly dependent on West Nile virus prevalence.","Custer, Brian; Busch, Michael P; Marfin, Anthony A; Petersen, Lyle R",Ann.

When Lone Wolf Defectors Undermine the Power of the Opt-Out Default,"High levels of cooperation are a central feature of human society, and conditional cooperation has been proposed as one proximal mechanism to support this. The counterforce of free-riding can, however, undermine cooperation and as such a number of external mechanisms have been proposed to ameliorate the effects of free-riding. One such mechanism is setting cooperation as the default (i.e., an opt-out default). We posit, however, that in dynamic settings where people can observe and condition their actions on others’ behaviour, ‘lone wolf’ defectors undermine initial cooperation encouraged by an opt-out default, while ‘good shepherds’ defeat the free-riding encouraged by an opt-in default. Thus, we examine the dynamic emergence of conditional cooperation under different default settings. Specifically, we develop a game theoretical model to analyse cooperation under defaults for cooperation (opt-out) and defection (opt-in). The model predicts that the ‘lone wolf’ effect is stronger than the ‘good shepherd’ effect, which – if anticipated by players – should strategically deter free-riding under opt-out and cooperation under opt-in. Our experimental games confirm the existence of both ‘lone wolf’ defectors and ‘good shepherd’ cooperators, and that the ‘lone wolf’effect is stronger in the context of organ donation registration behaviour. We thus show a potential ‘dark side’ to conditional cooperation (‘lone wolf effect’) and draw implications for the adoption of an opt-out organ donation policy. © 2020, The Author(s).","Ferguson, E.; Shichman, R.; Tan, J.H.W.",Sci.

The differential impact of social norms cues on charitable contributions,"Using a field experiment, we test the channel by which normative cues affect the decision process to donate to a public library. Our treatments consist of a reciprocity cue or an eyespots cue that is placed on the solicitation materials mailed out to potential donors during a public library fundraising drive. The data are consistent with a two stage decision process by which individuals first decide whether to make a donation and then decide how much to donate. We show that both cues significantly affect donation behavior by enhancing the intensity of the behavior while only one cue enhances the likelihood of engaging in the behavior. These results imply that what might look like a subtle or even fickle effect of normative cues on behavior is an economically sizable effect when we take into account what aspect of the decision process is affected by the cue. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Krupka, E.L.; Croson, R.T.A.",J.

An experimental test of the crowding out hypothesis,"We report the results of laboratory experiments that examine whether third-party contributions crowd out private giving to charity. Subjects play a single dictator game with a charity as the recipient. The subject chooses his preferred charity from a list. There are four treatment combinations: Two initial allocations and two frames. Initial allocations are either US$18 for the subject and US$2 for the charity, or US$15 and US$5, respectively, and the subject is then given the opportunity to allocate additional funds if desired. The decision frame is also varied to affect subjects' perceptions of the task. In one frame, subjects are simply informed of the initial allocations between themselves and their chosen charity. In the other, subjects are told that their US$20 allocation has been taxed, and the amount allocated to their chosen charity. The structure of payoffs is identical in both frames. In the first frame, we see a level of crowding out that is close to zero, far less than other experimental studies; in the second frame, we observe nearly 100% crowding out. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The impact of dementia in the prison setting: A systematic review,"Older prisoners are the fastest growing group in the prison population, with an accelerated aging process they are at a high risk of developing dementia. However, no systematic review has explored the impact of dementia in the prison setting. The objectives of this review were to identify the prevalence of dementia in the prison setting and how prison, health and social care providers assess, diagnose, treat, support and care for prisoners with dementia. A systematic search of the literature from the following databases was undertaken: CINHAL, PubMed, BNI, PsychINFO, and MEDLINE. Search strategies were tailored for each database and included recognised Medical Subject Headings. Hand searching of prominent journals in correctional services and dementia, as well as reference lists of included papers was completed. Open Grey website was searched to identify relevant government, local council and charity publications regarding dementia in the prison setting. The appropriate Critical Appraisal Skills Programmes Checklist for all included studies was completed. Following the application of inclusion and exclusion criteria, 10 studies were included in the review. Due to the nature of the data extracted, a meta-synthesis was not possible; therefore, a thematic synthesis was completed. Three themes emerged: prevalence of dementia in the prison population, identification of older prisoner’s needs, and knowledge of correctional officers and legal professionals. The prevalence and incidence of dementia in prison populations remain largely unknown. There is a need for national policies and local strategies that support a multi-disciplinary approach to early detection, screening and diagnosis of cognitive impairment and dementia across prison settings.

Altruism does not always lead to a good reputation: A normative explanation,"Individuals who engage in altruistic behaviors generally acquire a good reputation. However, recent studies have suggested that altruists are not always welcomed by others. We examined the possibility that norm-deviant altruism leads to unfavorable evaluations; distributing quite large amounts of one's resources could be less favored because the behavior deviates from social norms. In four studies, participants rated their feelings (i.e., liking and respect) toward a person who distributed his/her resources to others. We found that altruistic behavior that deviates from social norms was less favorably regarded than modestly altruistic behavior (Study 1–4), specifically in a culture with low tolerance for norm deviation (Japan; Study 3) and especially when the degree of the deviance was high (Study 2). These findings suggest that altruistic behavior is less favored when the behavior deviates from social norms and norm deviation is evaluated negatively. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Kawamura, Y.; Kusumi, T.",J.

Motivation and response rates in bronchoscopy studies,"Background: Bronchoscopy is frequently used to sample the lower airways in lung microbiome studies. Despite being a safe procedure, it is associated with discomfort that may result in reservations regarding participation in research bronchoscopy studies. Information on participation in research bronchoscopy studies is limited. We report response rates, reasons for non-response, motivation for participation, and predictors of participation in a large-scale single-centre bronchoscopy study (""MicroCOPD""). Methods: Two hundred forty-nine participants underwent at least one bronchoscopy in addition to being examined by a physician, having lung function tested, and being offered a CT scan of the heart and lungs (subjects > 40 years). Each participant was asked an open question regarding motivation. Non-response reasons were gathered, and response rates were calculated. Results: The study had a response rate just above 50%, and men had a significantly higher response rate than women (56.5% vs. 44.8%, p = 0.01). Procedural fear was the most common non-response reason. Most participants participated due to perceived personal benefit, but a large proportion did also participate to help others and contribute to science. Men were less likely to give exclusive altruistic motives, whereas subjects with asthma were more likely to report exclusive personal benefit as main motive. Conclusion: Response rates of about 50% in bronchoscopy studies make large bronchoscopy studies feasible, but the fact that participants are motivated by their own health status places a large responsibility on the investigators regarding the accuracy of the provided study information. © 2019 The Author(s).","Martinsen, E.M.H.; Eagan, T.M.L.; Leiten, E.O.; Nordeide, E.; Bakke, P.S.; Lehmann, S.; Nielsen, R.",Multidiscip.

In this paper, we use a rich Canadian data set to examine the relationship between direct contributions to charities and those made indirectly via charitable games. We find that individuals consider these two ways of giving as complementary to each other.

Friend or foe? Cooperation and learning in high-stakes games,"Why do people frequently cooperate in defiance of their immediate incentives? One explanation is that individuals are conditionally cooperative. As an explanation of behavior in one-shot settings, such preferences require individuals to be able to discern their opponents' preferences. Using data from a television game show, we provide evidence about how individuals implement conditionally cooperative preferences. We show that contestants forgo large sums of money to be cooperative; they cooperate at heightened levels when their opponents are predictably cooperative; and they fare worse when their observable characteristics predict less cooperation because opponents avoid cooperating with them. © 2010 by the President and Fellows of Harvard College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.","Oberholzer-Gee, F.; Waldfogel, J.; White, M.W.",Rev.

"Oral or parenteral iron supplementation to reduce deferral, iron deficiency and/or anaemia in blood donors","BACKGROUND: Iron deficiency is a significant cause of deferral in people wishing to donate blood. If iron removed from the body through blood donation is not replaced, then donors may become iron deficient. All donors are screened at each visit for low haemoglobin (Hb) levels. However, some deferred blood donors do not return to donate. Deferred first-time donors are even less likely to return. Interventions that reduce the risk of provoking iron deficiency and anaemia in blood donors will therefore increase the number of blood donations. Currently, iron supplementation for blood donors is not a standard of care in many blood services. A systematic review is required to answer specific questions regarding the efficacy and safety of iron supplementation in blood donors. OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy and safety of iron supplementation to reduce deferral, iron deficiency and/or anaemia in blood donors. SEARCH METHODS: We ran the search on 18 November 2013. We searched Cochrane Injuries Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, PubMed, MEDLINE (OvidSP), EMBASE (OvidSP), CINAHL (EBSCO Host) and six other databases. We also searched clinical trials registers and screened guidelines reference lists. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing iron supplementation versus placebo or control, oral versus parenteral iron supplementation, iron supplementation versus iron-rich food supplements, and different doses, treatment durations and preparations of iron supplementation in healthy blood donors. Autologous blood donors were excluded. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We combined data using random-effects meta-analyses. We evaluated heterogeneity using the I(2) statistic; we explored considerable heterogeneity (I(2) > 75%) in subgroup analyses. We carried out sensitivity analyses to assess the impact of trial quality on the results. MAIN RESULTS: Thirty RCTs (4704 participants) met the eligibility criteria, including 19 comparisons of iron supplementation and placebo or control; one comparison of oral and parenteral iron supplementation; four comparisons of different doses of iron supplementation; one comparison of different treatment durations of iron supplementation; and 12 comparisons of different iron supplementation preparations.Many studies were of low or uncertain methodological quality and therefore at high or uncertain risk of bias. We therefore rated the quality of the evidence for our outcomes as moderate. There was a statistically significant reduction in deferral due to low haemoglobin in donors who received iron supplementation compared with donors who received no iron supplementation, both at the first donation visit after commencement of iron supplementation (risk ratio (RR) 0.34; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.21 to 0.55; four studies; 1194 participants; P value < 0.0001) and at subsequent donations (RR 0.25; 95% CI 0.15 to 0.41; three studies; 793 participants; P value < 0.00001). Supplementation also resulted in significantly higher haemoglobin levels (mean difference (MD) 2.36 g/L; 95% CI 0.06 to 4.66; eight studies; 847 participants, P value =0.04), and iron stores, including serum ferritin (MD 13.98 ng/mL; 95% CI 8.92 to 19.03; five studies; 640 participants; P value < 0.00001) and transferrin saturation (MD 3.91%; 95% CI 2.02 to 5.80; four studies; 344 participants; P value < 0.0001) prior to further donation. The differences were maintained after subsequent donation(s).Adverse effects were widely reported and were more frequent in donors who received iron supplementation (RR 1.60; 95% CI 1.23 to 2.07; four studies; 1748 participants; P value = 0.0005). Adverse effects included constipation, diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting and taste disturbances, and some participants stopped treatment due to side effects. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is moderate quality evidence that rates of donor deferral due to low haemoglobin are considerably less in those taking iron supplements compared with those without iron supplementation, both at the first donation visit and at subsequent donation. Iron-supplemented donors also show elevated haemoglobin and iron stores. These beneficial effects are balanced by more frequent adverse events in donors who receive iron supplementation than in those who do not; this is likely to limit acceptability and compliance. The long-term effects of iron supplementation without measurement of iron stores are unknown. These considerations are likely to preclude widespread use of iron supplementation by tablets. Blood services may consider targeted use of supplementation in those at greatest risk of iron deficiency, personalised donation intervals and providing dietary advice.","Smith, Graham A; Fisher, Sheila A; Doree, Carolyn; Di Angelantonio, Emanuele; Roberts, David J",Cochrane Database Syst.

The singularity effect of identified victims in separate and joint evaluations,"People's greater willingness to help identified victims, relative to non-identified ones, was examined by eliciting real contributions to targets varying in singularity (a single individual vs. a group of several individuals), and the availability of individually identifying information (the main difference being the inclusion of a picture in the ""identified"" versions). Results of the first and second experiments support the proposal that for identified victims, contributions for a single victim exceed contributions for a group when these are judged separately, but preference reverses when one has to choose between contributing to the single individual and contributing to the group. In a third experiment, ratings of emotional response were elicited in addition to willingness to contribute judgments. Results suggest that the greater contribution to a single victim relative to the group stems from intensified emotions evoked by a single identified victim rather than from emotions evoked by identified victims in general. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Let's dialogue about penny: Effectiveness of dialogue involvement and legitimizing paltry contribution techniques,"Earlier research has shown (Cialdini & Schroeder, 1976) that the statement ""Even a penny will help"" added to a standard request for charity donation considerably increases the probability of carrying it out. The present study tested the effectiveness of this technique in various contexts in a set of 3 field experiments conducted on the streets of 2 Polish cities. The results proved, first, that success can be strengthened when combined with a dialogue in which a requester is involved prior to being asked for a donation. Second, it was shown that the dialogue itself produced more compliance than did a monologue. Third, it was demonstrated that dialogue related to the content of the requested issue may or may not result in an increase in compliance, presumably depending on the in-group/out-group focus of the dialogue's content.

Previous literature gives theoretical explanations for both the crowding-in and the crowding-out effects, while the empirical evidence presents different realities. In this study, we find a partial crowding-out effect (€1.00 of public funding reduces private contributions by €0.43) by using generalized method of moments estimators. However, this overall effect does not hold when analyzing the influence that different sources of public funds have on each type of private contribution. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","de Andres-Alonso, P.; Garcia-Rodriguez, I.; Romero-Merino, M.E.",Financ.

Facial resemblance enhances trust,"Organisms are expected to be sensitive to cues of genetic relatedness when making decisions about social behaviour. Relatedness can be assessed in several ways, one of which is phenotype matching: the assessment of similarity between others' traits and either one's own traits or those of known relatives. One candidate cue of relatedness in humans is facial resemblance. Here, I report the effects of an experimental manipulation of facial resemblance in a two-person sequential trust game. Subjects were shown faces of ostensible playing partners manipulated to resemble either themselves or an unknown person. Resemblance to the subject's own face raised the incidence of trusting a partner, but had no effect on the incidence of selfish betrayals of the partner's trust. Control subjects playing with identical pictures failed to show such an effect. In a second experiment, resemblance of the playing partner to a familiar (famous) person had no effect on either trusting or betrayals of trust.","DeBruine, L.M.",Proc. R. Soc. B Biol. Sci.,1696

Rule of rescue or the good of the many? An analysis of physicians' and nurses' preferences for allocating ICU beds,"Purpose: To examine intensive care unit (ICU) clinicians' willingness to trade off societal benefits in favor of a small chance of rescuing an identifiable critically ill patient. Methods: We sent mixed-methods questionnaires to national samples of US ICU clinicians, soliciting their preferences for allocating their last bed to a gravely ill patient with little chance to survive, versus a deceased or dying patient for whom aggressive management could help others through organ donation. Results: Complete responses were obtained from 684 of 2,206 physicians (31.0%) and 438 of 988 nurses (44.3%); there was no evidence of non-response bias. Physicians were more likely than nurses to adhere to the ""rule of rescue"" by allocating the last bed to the gravely ill patient (45.9 vs. 32.6%, difference = 13.2%; 95% CI 9.1-17.3%). The magnitude of the social benefit to be obtained through organ donor management (5 or 30 life-years added for transplant recipients) had small and inconsistent effects on clinicians' willingness to prioritize the donor. In qualitative analyses, the most common reason for allocating the last bed to an identifiable patient (identified by 65% of physicians and 75% of nurses) was that clinicians perceived strong obligations to identifiable living patients. Conclusions: More than one-third of ICU clinicians forewent substantial social benefits so as to devote resources to an individual patient unlikely to benefit from them. Such allegiance to the rule of rescue suggests challenges for efforts to reform ICU triage practices. © 2011 Copyright jointly held by Springer and ESICM.","Kohn, R.; Rubenfeld, G.D.; Levy, M.M.; Ubel, P.A.; Halpern, S.D.",Intensive Care Med.,1698

Temporal dynamics of resting EEG networks are associated with prosociality,"As prosociality is key to facing many of our societies’ global challenges (such as fighting a global pandemic), we need to better understand why some individuals are more prosocial than others. The present study takes a neural trait approach, examining whether the temporal dynamics of resting EEG networks are associated with inter-individual differences in prosociality. In two experimental sessions, we collected 55 healthy males’ resting EEG, their self-reported prosocial concern and values, and their incentivized prosocial behavior across different reward domains (money, time) and social contexts (collective, individual). By means of EEG microstate analysis we identified the temporal coverage of four canonical resting networks (microstates A, B, C, and D) and their mutual communication in order to examine their association with an aggregated index of prosociality. Participants with a higher coverage of microstate A and more transitions from microstate C to A were more prosocial. Our study demonstrates that temporal dynamics of intrinsic brain networks can be linked to complex social behavior. On the basis of previous findings on links of microstate A with sensory processing, our findings suggest that participants with a tendency to engage in bottom-up processing during rest behave more prosocially than others. © 2020, The Author(s).","Schiller, B.; Kleinert, T.; Teige-Mocigemba, S.; Klauer, K.C.; Heinrichs, M.",Sci.

A regulatory focus perspective on reputational concerns: The impact of prevention-focused self-regulation,"The hyper-sociality found in the human species is unequivocally manifested in their special sensitivity about reputation. In the present contribution, individuals’ reputational concerns are examined from the perspective of one prominent motivational approach: regulatory focus theory. Specifically, individual differences in prevention and promotion focus are related to reputational concerns. Building on the assumption that prevention-focused individuals are sensitive to and concerned with oughts and social expectations, it is expected that prevention-focused individuals are particularly concerned regarding their reputation. In line with this assumption, Study 1 documents a positive relation between individual differences in prevention focus and reputational concerns (beyond the Big Five and perceived stress). In Study 2, individuals are exposed to a subtle reputation cue (i.e., stylized watching eyes). It is documented that prevention-focused individuals specifically react to this cue in that they donate more money when such a cue is present. This finding is replicated in an additional sample and shown to be independent of the Big Five. In sum, the present work contributes to a better understanding of basic motivational orientations regarding reputational concerns. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Pfattheicher, S.",Motiv.

Short-term benefits and risks of intravenous iron: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"The findings suggest that treatment with nondextran IV iron may be of benefit to a variety of patients. XCM: There was a clearly stated review question and clear inclusion criteria. Several appropriate sources were searched without language restrictions for published and unpublished studies, thereby minimising publication and language bias. Appropriate review methods were also used to minimise error and bias in the study selection and quality assessment processes, although it is unclear whether these methods were used for the data extraction. The exclusion of studies with unavailable raw data or limited sample sizes may mean that some relevant studies were missed. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed, though the source of the heterogeneity was not fully investigated. However, the studies included very different participant populations and there may well be clinical heterogeneity present; in view of this, the pooling of studies may not have been appropriate. In summary, the uncertainty about between-study differences means that the reliability of the authors’ conclusions is unclear. XIM: Practice: The authors did not state any implications for practice. Research: The authors stated that further large RCTs are necessary to clarify the efficacy and safety of IV iron.","Notebaert, E; Chauny, J M; Albert, M; Fortier, S; Leblanc, N; Williamson, D R",,1704
Youth gambling problems: A need for responsible social policy,"Games of chance have been popular throughout time. Beginning around 3000 B.C. Egyptian popular forms of gambling included astragals, primero (an early card game found in Europe) and wagering on chariot races (Caltabiano, 2003). Egyptian and Middle Eastern archeological sites have revealed historical accounts of the pervasiveness of gambling in ancient cultures (Ashton, 1968). While gambling in general remained a popular pursuit, the negative effects associated with excessive problem gambling were also documented. Plato suggested that a demon named Theuth created dice (astragals or knucklebones as they were originally named) and early reports indicate that King Richard the Lion-Hearted, who led the crusade in 1190, issued orders restricting gambling with dice to his troops. Gambling problems were not isolated only to the common man but to royalty as well. King Henry VIII is reported to have lost the largest and most famous church bells in England at that time-the Jesus bells that hung in St. Paul's Cathedral-in a game of dice (Fleming, 1978). The history of gambling on an international level has passed through a number of cycles from prohibition to widespread proliferation (Rose, 2003a). Gambling has gone from being associated with sin, criminal behavior, and corruption to its current position as a form of socially acceptable entertainment. Gambling revenues have emerged as an important source of funds for governments, charities, and businesses. The changing landscape of gambling throughout the world seems to suggest that the pendulum between abstinence and widespread acceptance may never swing back to prohibition or to a more restrictive position. More and more countries have either introduced gambling or permitted the establishment of gambling in their jurisdictions. Until relatively recently, gambling problems have not been viewed as a public health problem (Korn & Shaffer, 1999) or public policy issue but rather as a personal or individual problem (Whyte, 2003). A new surge of research has expanded our knowledge of gambling problems and its societal impact, with legislators being forced to carefully examine the social and financial costs associated with gambling expansion and regulation as well as assessing the accrued financial benefits (National Institute of Economics and Industry Research, 2003). The prevailing attitudes of government legislators and the public at large appears to suggest that new gaming venues, new forms of gambling (e.g., new technologies in the form of interactive lotteries, Internet gambling and telephone wagering), and the proliferation of current forms of gambling (e.g., casinos, electronic gambling machines, lotteries) will continue to expand rapidly. While a number of social policy experts have suggested that at some point in time there will be a saturation point, the gambling industry continues to expand worldwide at an unprecedented rate with revenues far exceeding all forms of the entertainment industry (e.g., music, movies, theatre, etc.) combined. The anti-lobbying groups appear to have been minor impediments and irritants to slowing the growth of specific forms of gambling. While there have been some notable exceptions for the prohibition of gambling (e.g., Turkey where a new Muslim government banned gambling; the public outcry helped remove video lottery terminals and electronic gambling machines from South Carolina; and there is a movement to reduce the number of electronic gambling machines in several Australian states), the anti-gambling movement appears to have done little to curtail the continued expansion of gambling in spite of the empirical evidence documenting some of the social and personal costs. Currently, gambling is not viewed negatively but rather as a legitimate, socially acceptable form of entertainment. Over 85% of Americans report having gambled at least once during their lifetime and 65% report gambling during the past year (National Research Council, 1999), with somewhat similar results being reported in Canada (Azmier, 2000), Australia (Productivity Commission, 1999), and New Zealand (Abbott, 2001). Nevertheless, gambling remains a highly contentious social policy issue throughout the world [see the reports from the U.S. National Gambling Study Impact Commission (NORC, 1999), Canada West Foundation (Azmier, 2001), Canadian Tax Foundation Report (Vaillancourt & Roy, 2000), the U.K. Gambling Review Report (2001), the Australian Productivity Commission Report (1999), the National Centre for the Study of Gambling, South Africa Report (Collins & Barr, 2001), and those from New Zealand (Abbott, 2001)]. While the perspective is slowly changing that gambling is not necessarily a harmless, innocuous behavior with few negative consequences, most adults support their continued opportunity to gamble and perceive it to be considerably less harmful than other potentially additive behaviors and harmful social activities (Azmier, 2000). The legitimacy of gambling has often been tied to the perceived public good associated with its revenues (Preston, Bernhard, Hunter & Bybee, 1998). Some of America's best-known universities including Harvard, Yale, Princeton, William and Mary, Dartmouth, Rutgers, and the University of Pennsylvania have historically acquired operating funds through the proceeds generated from lotteries. This early tradition continues, with many state and national lotteries promoting their products by reporting that a proportion of the proceeds are used for needed educational initiatives and social service programs. In other jurisdictions, gambling revenues are partially or totally used for charitable purposes. Gambling remains somewhat unique from other public policy issues as it cuts across a number of other policy domains including social, economic, public health, criminal and justice policy (Wynne, 1998). As a public health policy issue, gambling has been growing in importance. Korn and Shaffer (1999) have made a very strong argument for viewing gambling within a public health framework by examining it from a population health and human ecology perspective. They have suggested that disordered gambling may not only be problematic in and of itself, but also may be a gateway to alcohol and substance abuse, depression, anxiety and other significant mental health disorders. Gambling, once perceived as an activity primarily relegated to adults, has become a popular form of entertainment for adolescents (National Research Council, 1999). While in most jurisdictions legislative statutes prohibit children and adolescents from participating in legalized forms of gambling due to age restrictions, their resourcefulness enables many youth to engage in both regulated legal forms of gambling and those non-regulated gambling activities. Research has revealed that upwards of 80% of adolescents have engaged in some form of gambling (see the reviews by Jacobs, in this volume; National Research Council, 1999, and the meta-analysis by Shaffer & Hall, 1996), with most best described as social gamblers having few gambling-related problems. Yet, there remains ample evidence that between 4'8% of adolescents have a very serious gambling problem with another 10'15% at-risk for the development of a gambling. While difficulties in the measurement of adolescent pathological and disordered gambling exist (see Derevensky & Gupta in this volume, and Derevensky, Gupta & Winters, 2003 for a comprehensive examination of this issue), the National Research Council report concluded that 'the proportion of pathological gamblers among adolescents in the United States could be more than three times that of adults (5.0% versus 1.5%)' (National Research Council, 1999, p.89). In the U.S. and Canada, these prevalence estimates indicate that approximately 15.3 million 12'17 year olds have been gambling, while 2.2 million are likely experiencing serious gambling related problems. Trends between 1984'2002 seem to indicate a continued increase in the proportion of youth who report gambling within the past year and those who report some gambling related problems (Jacobs, in this volume). Our prevailing social policies, often established by default, appear predicated upon a harm minimization model (see Dickson, Derevensky & Gupta, 2004 for a more comprehensive discussion). Yet the development of effective social policy needs to be both reflective and directive of the social context from which it is derived. As such, good social policies should reflect the current status of gambling while simultaneously projecting its future; it must be sensitive to its historical context, yet must exist within the prevailing ideological, social, economic and political values (Hall, Kagan & Zigler, 1996); and such policies must also be considerate of broader cultural and religious influences and differences. The escalation of government supported (and owned) gambling is an enormous social experiment for which we currently do not have sufficient and reliable data to predict the long-term social costs (Derevensky, Gupta, Hardoon, Dickson & Deguire, 2003).","Derevensky, J L; Gupta, R; Messerlian, C; Gillespie, M",Gambling Problems in Youth: Theoretical and Applied Perspectives,1705
Individual and community behavioral responses to natural disasters,"How do people and communities respond to catastrophes? A natural disaster is a type of external, quasi-random and unexpected catastrophic shock that generates psychological, social and economic implications. Using detailed county level administrative data of charitable contributions, crime and natural hazards in the USA in the recent decade, we empirically identify and quantify the causal effect of natural disasters on prosocial and antisocial behavioral reactions. Our main finding is that while monetary contributions decline in the local affected community in the aftermath of natural disasters, the neighboring and more distant communities react by increasing their charitable giving. Additionally, we find that in the affected community, natural disasters effect crime negatively, dispelling popular conceptions regarding looting, and that while federal assistance crowds out charitable contributions, it does not change the residents reaction to natural disasters. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Berrebi, C.; Karlinsky, A.; Yonah, H.",Nat.

"Hey Buddy, Can You Spare Seventeen Cents? Mindful Persuasion and the Pique Technique","According to the pique technique, a target is more likely to comply if mindless refusal is disrupted by a strange or unusual request. We demonstrated the use of this technique in two experiments. In Experiment 1, passersby on a local municipal wharf were approached by a confederate panhandler who made either one of two strange requests: “Can you spare 17¢ (or 37¢)?” or made either one of two typical requests “Can you spare a quarter (or any change)?” Subjects in the strange conditions were almost 60% more likely to give money than those receiving the typical plea. In addition, a strange request piqued interest as evidenced by increased verbal inquiries about the request. Experiment 2 replicated the first experiment in a laboratory setting and provides additional evidence (via a cognitive response analysis) that strange requests piqued subjects' interest in the appeal as well as increased liking for the panhandler.

Maintenance therapy with triple versus double immunosuppressive regimen in renal transplantation: a meta-analysis,"BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to compare the effect of triple immunosuppressive maintenance therapy (cyclosporine, azathioprine, and prednisolone) with that of double therapy (cyclosporine and prednisolone) in renal transplant patients using graft failure, mortality, and acute rejection episodes as outcome measures. METHODS: A systematic overview of articles published between 1984 and 1995 was done. MEDLINE, Science Citation Index, reference lists, and expert files were searched. Of 449 originally identified studies, five controlled trials were finally selected. Information was retrieved on the topics of methodological quality, baseline characteristics, interventions, and outcomes. The Mantel-Haenszel fixed effect method was used to combine results from different studies. RESULTS: Pooled analysis did not show a statistically significant difference between triple-drug therapy and double-drug therapy in the main outcome of graft failure (odds ratio [OR], 0.82; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.61-1.16), survival (OR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.57-1.21), or the occurrence of acute graft rejection (OR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.76-1.36). There was a nonsignificant trend for better graft survival under triple therapy. A lower withdrawal rate suggests a more stable immunosuppressive effect on triple therapy. CONCLUSIONS: There is no statistically significant difference in the long-term management of renal transplant recipients between the two treatment regimens.","Kunz, R; Neumayer, H H",Transplantation,1710
The Emotional Cost of Humanity: Anticipated Exhaustion Motivates Dehumanization of Stigmatized Targets,"Although mind perception is a basic part of social interaction, people often dehumanize others by denying them mental states. Many theories suggest that dehumanization happens in order to facilitate aggression or account for past immorality. We suggest a novel motivation for dehumanization: to avoid affective costs. We show that dehumanization of stigmatized targets (e.g., drug addicts) relative to nonstigmatized targets is strongest for those who are motivated to avoid emotional exhaustion. In Experiment 1, participants anticipated more exhaustion from helping, and attributed less mind to, a stigmatized target and anticipated exhaustion partially mediated the influence of stigma on mind attribution. Experiment 2 manipulated anticipated exhaustion prior to an empathy plea and revealed that the influence of stigma on mind attribution was only present when people anticipated high levels of emotional exhaustion. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","Cameron, C.D.; Harris, L.T.; Payne, B.K.",Soc.

How Do Nonprofit Firms Respond to Tax Policy?,"We investigate the effects of variations in the value of the charitable contribution deduction on nonprofit firm behavior, including exploring for the first time the effects of the tax price of giving on fund-raising. We find that a 1 percent increase in tax subsidies is correlated with a 2.0 percent increase in fund-raising, while the elasticity of real charitable output to changes in tax price is less than one in absolute value for most firms. We derive a new equation for treasury efficiency in the presence of fund-raising and find that while our point estimates still support treasury efficiency, our confidence intervals are wide enough to allow some possibility that the deduction is not cost effective. Further, the modest elasticity of charitable output to tax price implies that tax subsidies can crowd out other revenue sources, such that the efficacy of the subsidy depends on the relative efficiency of these alternative sources. © 2016, The Author(s) 2016.","Galle, B.",Public Financ.

A Perspective on Judgment and Choice: Mapping Bounded Rationality,"Early studies of intuitive judgment and decision making conducted with the late Amos Tversky are reviewed in the context of two related concepts: an analysis of accessibility, the ease with which thoughts come to mind; a distinction between effortless intuition and deliberate reasoning. Intuitive thoughts, like percepts, are highly accessible. Determinants and consequences of accessibility help explain the central results of prospect theory, framing effects, the heuristic process of attribute substitution, and the characteristic biases that result from the substitution of nonextensional for extensional attributes. Variations in the accessibility of rules explain the occasional corrections of intuitive judgments. The study of biases is compatible with a view of intuitive thinking and decision making as generally skilled and successful.","Kahneman, D.",Am. Psychol.,1714
Dilemma of Hotel Reviews: The Role of Information Processing and Validation through Metacognition,"A comprehensive model is proposed to understand how travelers manage copious and even competing online reviews through a validation process, by examining the impact of social support, persuasive message compliance, persuasive message resistance, and metacognition on tourists’ willingness to be involved in social commerce. Based on the theories of signaling and reactance, the model explores how social forces, such as online social support and personal information-processing drivers (i.e., information processing and validating procedure), can explain customers’ social commerce intentions. A survey of tourists in 61 mid- to high-end hotels indicates that social support is positively related to persuasive message compliance, resistance, and social commerce intention. The findings indicate that persuasive message compliance and resistance mediate the relationship between social support and social commerce intention, whereas the mediation relationships are conditioned on metacognition. © The Author(s) 2020.","Huang, G.I.; Wong, I.A.; Law, R.",J.

Effects of picture and even-a-penny-will-help appeals on anonymous donations to charity,"The present research explored the effectiveness of a picture and the phrase ""even a penny will help"" on contributions to charity. Two experiments were conducted, one in the laboratory and one in the field. In both experiments the manipulation of a pleasant picture and the phrase created four types of signs: (1) picture-no phrase, (2) phrase-no picture, (3) picture-phrase, and (4) no picture-no phrase. In the field experiment patrons of local business anonymously put money in a donation box that displayed one of the four signs. In the laboratory experiment, 129 undergraduate students were randomly assigned to view one of the four signs placed on a donation box for a local charity. Analyses for both studies showed that more money was donated when the boxes displayed pictures. The phrase ""even a penny will help"" had no significant effect on donations.","Perrine, R.M.; Heather, S.",Psychol. Rep.,1716

Government growth and private contributions to charity,"We exploit the time-series properties of charitable giving to provide additional insights into the relationship between charitable contributions and government spending. Cointegration tests reveal a significant long-run relationship between several categories of charitable giving and government spending. Granger causality tests provide evidence on the short-run giving and spending relationship. Evidence suggests that charitable contributions to education respond quite differently to state and local government education expenditures versus federal government expenditures.

Laparoscopic versus open live donor hepatectomy in liver transplantation: a systemic review and meta-analysis,"Objective: The aim of this study was to compare laparoscopic versus open live donor liver transplantation using meta-analysis. Background: Living donor liver transplantation (LDLT), as an alternative to deceased donor liver transplantation (DDLT), has increasingly performed all around the world. Laparoscopic live donor hepatectomy (LLDH) has been performed increasingly, and is gaining worldwide acceptance. As the studies assessing the safety and efficacy of laparoscopic compared with open techniques is growing, we combined the available data to conduct this meta-analysis to compare the two techniques. Methods: A literature search was performed to identify studies comparing laparoscopic with open live donor hepatectomy (OLDH) published before June 2015. Perioperative outcomes (blood loss, operative time, hospital stay, analgesia use) and postoperative complications (donors and recipients postoperative complications, recipients specific postoperative complications including biliary complications and vascular complications) were the main outcomes evaluated in the meta-analysis. Results: Fourteen studies with a total of 1136 patients were included in this meta-analysis, of which 357 were treated by laparoscopic technique and 779 were treated by the open procedures. Compared with the open group, laparoscopic group was associated with significant less estimated blood loss (P=0.01), shorter duration of operation (P=0.02), length of hospital stay (P=0.003) and duration of PCA use (P=0.04). The laboratory tests such as peak ALT and AST after operation were similar (P=0.72 and P=1.00). There was a significant higher rate of overall donor morbidity (P=0.002) and donor minor complications (Grade I-II) (P=0.02) in the open group. No significant difference was observed in donor major complications (Grade III-V), recipients overal morbidity and recipients complications such as bile complications and vascular complications. Conclusions: LLDH is a excellent alternative to OLDH because it is associated with better perioperative outcomes and similar prognosis.","Xu, Dong-Wei; Wan, Ping; Zhang, Jian-Jun; Xia, Qiang",Int. J.

What works for adolescents with AN: a systematic review of psychosocial interventions,"Owing to the paucity and methodological inadequacies of the primary studies, no clear recommendations could be made. XCM: This review was based on clear inclusion criteria. A thorough search for both published and unpublished data appears to have been carried out, which suggests that the authors have located all of the relevant data, although it was unclear whether any language restrictions were applied. The method used to select the studies may be subject to bias since only a limited number of decisions were double-checked by a second reviewer. In addition, the authors did not state how the data were extracted, which makes it difficult to judge whether appropriate steps were taken to reduce errors in this process. What is not clear is whether the quality of the included studies was appropriately assessed. The authors discussed the validity of the studies, but individual study details were not provided. Hence, it is unclear whether a formal assessment was carried out. If such an assessment was carried out, the authors should report how decisions were made and how many reviewers were involved, in order to reassure the reader of the robustness of the assessment.The authors could have made more attempts to synthesise their data as the studies were discussed separately. However, any such synthesis is going to be limited given the apparent heterogeneity between studies in terms of the interventions, study design, outcomes and participants. Clearer data tables could perhaps have made it easier to compare any similarities and differences across the studies. Overall, given the paucity and quality of the data, the authors are justified in not making any recommendations for practice from their review; their suggestions for further research appear reasonable. XIM: Practice: The authors did not state any implications for practice.Research: The authors stated that more high-quality research in the form of large RCTs examining a range of relevant interventions (e.g. cognitive-behavioural therapy, desensitisation and relaxation training) is required.","Tierney S, Wyatt K",,1721

Two- and five-year follow-up of lumbar total disc replacement compared to fusion: a meta-analysis,"Lumbar fusion surgery has been a gold standard for treating lumbar disc degenerative disease (LDDD). But the adjacent segment pathology (ASP) became a problem, which could have been caused by the increased motion and stress concentration at the adjacent segment. So, artificial total disc replacement (TDR) as an alternative to spinal fusion has recently been applied for treatment of LDDD. However, up to now, a controversy whether TDR is better than fusion still persists. We performed the research of database including Pubmed/Medline, EMBASE, and Ovid. Our studies were classified into short-term (2 years) and midterm (5 years) follow-up. Twelve randomized controlled trials involving 1479 cases were included in the study. The repetitive data from them were excluded. Significant difference in visual analogue scale (VAS) and Oswestry disability index (ODI) could be found at 2 year follow-up, and TDR group was better than fusion group in both of them (VAS: I-2=0%, P<0.0006; ODI: I-2=0%, P<0.00001). No difference was found in reoperation rate at 2 year follow-up (I-2=18%, P=0.22). However, the reoperation rate at the index level in TDR group was significantly lower than that in fusion group at 5 year follow-up (I-2=0%, P=0.006). The incidence of ASP in TDR group was lower compared with fusion group at 5 year follow-up (I-2=0%, P<0.0002) but not at 2 year follow-up (I-2=0%, P<0.08). TDR shows the efficacy and safety comparable to lumbar fusion at 2 and 5 year follow-up. Besides, TDR has significant superiority in a lower incidence of ASP at 5 year follow-up.","Ma, Lei; Yang, Sidong; Wang, Hui; Zhang, Di; Ding, Wenyuan",Int. J. Clin. Exp. Med.,1726

"Of apples and oranges, file drawers and garbage: Why validity issues in meta-analysis will not go away","This paper examines how threats to the validity of meta-analysis have been dealt with by clinical researchers employing this approach to literature review. Three validity threats were identified - mixing of dissimilar studies, publication bias, and inclusion of poor quality studies. Approaches to addressing these threats were evaluated for their effectiveness and popularity by surveying 32 published meta-analyses in clinical psychology. Distrust of meta-analysis, however, was found to transcend these validity threats. Other explanations for why this popular research strategy continues to receive widespread criticism were considered. Suggestions were made for how meta-analysis might better address these concerns.","Sharpe, D.",Clin. Psychol. Rev.,1728

"Explanatory model of violent behaviours, selfconcept and empathy in schoolchildren. Structural equations analysis","The increased visibility of bullying cases has led the scientific community to be more interested in analysing the factors affecting these behaviours in order to reduce bullying cases and their negative consequences. The aim of this study was to define and contrast an explanatory model that makes it possible to analyse the relationships between self-concept, empathy and violent behaviours in schoolchildren through structural equation analysis. The sample of this study is made up of 734 schoolchildren from the province of Granada (Spain), both male and female, aged between 10 and 12, and it consists of analysing self-concept (AF-5), empathy levels (TECA) and violent behaviour at schools (ECV). A structural equation model was performed and successfully adjusted (χ2 = 563.203; DF = 59; p &lt; 0.001; CFI = 0.943; NFI = 0.937; IFI = 0.943; RMSEA = 0.076). A positive and direct relationship between self-concept and cognitive empathy has been found; manifest aggression is negatively related to self-concept. Similarly, affective empathy has a negative relationship with relational aggression. The main conclusions of this study are that the levels of self-concept and empathy represent protective factors against the development of violent and victimisation behaviours in schoolchildren. © 2019 Castro-Sánchez et al.

Pro-environmental behavior as a signal of cooperativeness: Evidence from a social dilemma experiment,"Pro-environmental behavior has social signaling value. Previous research suggests that enacting pro-environmental behaviors can signal certain personal characteristics, such as social status and trustworthiness, to others. Using an incentivized experiment, we show that people known to behave pro-environmentally are expected to be more cooperative, are preferred as cooperation partners, and elicit more cooperation from others. The presence of pro-environmental individuals may thus motivate others to exert more effort towards reaching cooperative goals, even in situations where individual and group goals are at odds (i.e., social dilemmas). However, people who behaved pro-environmentally were actually no more cooperative than those performing fewer pro-environmental behaviors. © 2019 The Authors","Vesely, S.; Klöckner, C.A.; Brick, C.",J.

"Revisiting REVISE: (Re)Testing unique and combined effects of REminding, VIsibility, and SElf-engagement manipulations on cheating behavior","Dishonest behavior poses a crucial threat to individuals and societies at large. To highlight situation factors that potentially reduce the occurrence and/or extent of dishonesty, Ayal, Gino, Barkan, and Ariely (2015) introduced the REVISE framework, consisting of three principles: REminding, VIsibility, and SElf-engagement. The evidence that the three REVISE principles actually reduce dishonesty is not always strong and sometimes even inconsistent, however. We herein thus conceptually replicate three suggested manipulations, each serving as an operationalization of one principle. In a large study with eight conditions and 5,039 participants, we link the REminding, VIsibility, and SElf-engagement manipulations to dishonesty, compare their effectiveness with each other, and test for potential interactions between them. Overall, we find that VIsibilty (in terms of overtly monitoring responses) and SElf-engagement (in terms of retyping an honesty statement) reduce dishonest behavior. We find no support for the effectiveness of REminding (in terms of ethical priming) or for any interaction between the REVISE principles. We also report two preregistered manipulation-check studies and discuss policy implications of our findings. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Schild, C.; Heck, D.W.; Ścigała, K.A.; Zettler, I.",J. Econ.

Funds allocation in NPOs: the role of administrative cost ratios,"Performance measurement of Non-Profit Organizations (NPOs) is of increasing importance for aid agencies, policy-makers and donors. A widely used benchmark for measuring the efficiency of NPOs is the overhead cost ratio, consisting of the total money spent on administration and fundraising relative to the budget. Donors generally favor a lower overhead cost ratio as it ensures that more money directly reaches beneficiaries. Unlike fundraising expenses, administrative costs do not contribute to advertising the actions of an NPO even though they account for a significant proportion of overhead cost. Reducing administrative expenses is a logical consequence from a financial viewpoint, but might negatively affect NPOs through the resulting administrative capacities. This phenomenon is known as “Nonprofit Starvation Cycle”. This work provides an analytical framework for analyzing NPO decision making concerning administrative costs. The paper provides answers to important research questions on the optimal level of administrative spending, the influencing factors and the effects of available information on NPOs. The research shows that focusing on financial performance measurements can result in reduced utility created for NPOs. Less transparency often leads to increased utility for NPOs, but more transparency can increase NPOs’ utility if the information available exceeds a certain threshold. Fluctuating donations are challenging for NPOs’ planning and may impact administrative capacities negatively. © 2017, The Author(s).","Burkart, C.; Wakolbinger, T.; Toyasaki, F.",Cent. Eur. J. Oper.

Precise time-matching in chimpanzee allogrooming does not occur after a short delay,"Allogrooming is a key aspect of chimpanzee sociality and many studies have investigated the role of reciprocity in a biological market. One theoretical form of reciprocity is time-matching, where payback consists of an equal duration of effort (e.g. twenty seconds of grooming repaid with twenty seconds of grooming). Here, we report a study of allogrooming in a group of twenty-six captive chimpanzees (Chester Zoo, UK), based on more than 150 hours of data. For analysis, we introduce a methodological innovation called the “Delta scale”, which unidimensionally measures the accuracy of time-matching according to the extent of delay after the cessation of grooming. Delta is positive when reciprocation occurs after any non-zero delay (e.g. A grooms B and then B grooms A after a five second break) and it is negative when reciprocation begins whilst the original grooming has not yet ceased. Using a generalized linear mixed-method, we found evidence for time-matched reciprocation. However, this was true only for immediate reciprocation (Delta less than zero). If there was a temporal break in grooming between two members of a dyad, then there was no evidence that chimpanzees were using new bouts to retroactively correct for time-matching imbalances from previous bouts. Our results have implications for some of the cognitive constraints that differentiate real-life reciprocation from abstract theoretical models. Furthermore, we suggest that some apparent patterns of time-matched reciprocity may arise merely due to the law of large numbers, and we introduce a statistical test which takes this into account when aggregating grooming durations over a window of time. © 2018 Phelps et al.

When a service request precedes the target request: another compliance without pressure technique?,"Empirical observation led us to identify a particular and widespread form of solicitation involving requesting a service before making the target request. Relating this form of solicitation to compliance paradigms based on consistency, we hypothesized that the technique would increase the compliance rates of individuals. 167 passersby were approached in the street for a money donation according to two conditions: the appeal for money was preceded by a service request or not. We found that those passersby receiving the service request and the monetary appeal were significantly more compliant than those receiving the monetary appeal only. The discussion focuses on the psychological mechanisms at work in the acceptance of the requests, and avenues for future research are suggested.","Meineri, Sebastien; Dupre, Mickaël; Vallee, Boris; Gueguen, Nicolas",Social Influence,1738

Goal-directed Emotions,"This research explores the role of emotions in goal-directed behaviour. A model is provided for an emotional goal system whereby appraisals of the consequences of achieving or not achieving a goal are hypothesised to elicit anticipatory emotions; the anticipatory emotions are expected, in turn, to contribute to volitions in the service of goal pursuit (namely, intentions, plans, and the decision to expend energy); goal-directed behaviours next arise in response to volitions and lead to goal attainment; and the latter then functions as the basis for a new set of appraisals and accompanying goal-outcome emotions. The model was tested in a longitudinal study of the responses of 406 adults (243 women, 163 men) in The Netherlands. The context for the study was the regulation of one's body weight via exercising and dieting.","Bagozzi, R.P.; Baumgartner, H.; Pieters, R.",Cogn. Emot.,1740
Dose-specific efficacy of Haemophilus influenzae type b conjugate vaccines: a systematic review and meta-analysis of controlled clinical trials,"Global coverage of infant Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccination has increased considerably during the past decade, partly due to GAVI Alliance donations of the vaccine to low-income countries. In settings where large numbers of children receive only one or two vaccine doses rather than the recommended three doses, dose-specific efficacy estimates are needed to predict impact. The objective of this meta-analysis is to determine Hib vaccine efficacy against different clinical outcomes after receiving one, two or three doses of vaccine. Studies were eligible for inclusion if a prospective, controlled design had been used to evaluate commercially available Hib conjugate vaccines. Eight studies were included. Pooled vaccine efficacies against invasive Hib disease after one, two or three doses of vaccine were 59%, 92% and 93%, respectively. The meta-analysis provides robust estimates for use in decision-analytical models designed to predict the impact of Hib vaccine.","Griffiths, U K; Clark, A; Gessner, B; Miners, A; Sanderson, C; Sedyaningsih, E R; Mulholland, K E",Epidemiol.

A Closer Look at Eyespot Effects on Voter Turnout: Reply to Matland and Murray,"Implicit social pressure, applied via exposure to eyespots in nonpartisan, direct-mail blandishments to vote, has been shown using randomized field experiments to raise turnout in elections. Similar eyespot effects have been observed across a wide range of prosocial behaviors. A series of recent replications conducted by Matland and Murray (2015) have failed to consistently produce statistically significant eyespot effects on voter turnout, however, leading the authors to conclude the effects observed in previous research were likely illusory. In this article, I rebut this claim, arguing that an alternative, more circumspect interpretation of the authors’ key results points to a different conclusion that supports the notion that eyespots likely stimulate voting, especially when taken together with previous findings. © 2015 International Society of Political Psychology","Panagopoulos, C.",Polit.

"A positive effect of flowers rather than eye images in a large-scale, cross-cultural dictator game","People often consider how their behaviour will be viewed by others, and may cooperate to avoid gaining a bad reputation. Sensitivity to reputation may be elicited by subtle social cues of being watched: previous studies have shown that people behave more cooperatively when they see images of eyes rather than control images. Here, we tested whether eye images enhance cooperation in a dictator game, using the online labour market Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT). In contrast to our predictions and the results of most previous studies, dictators gave away more money when they saw images of flowers rather than eye images. Donations in response to eye images were not significantly different to donations under control treatments. Dictator donations varied significantly across cultures but there was no systematic variation in responses to different image types across cultures. Unlike most previous studies, players interacting via AMT may feel truly anonymous when making decisions and, as such, may not respond to subtle social cues of being watched. Nevertheless, dictators gave away similar amounts as in previous studies, so anonymity did not erase helpfulness. We suggest that eye images might only promote cooperative behaviour in relatively public settings and that people may ignore these cues when they know their behaviour is truly anonymous. © 2012 The Royal Society.","Raihani, N.J.; Bshary, R.",Proc.

The emotional cost of charitable donations,"Donations in support of a charitable cause can create a conflict between moral intuitions (e.g., fulfilling moral obligations and helping as many individuals in need as possible) and the cost entailed by following one's moral intuitions (e.g., spending money). The present paper investigates this conflict by putting people in a situation in which they must choose whether to help three women by giving more money or help one woman by giving less. In addition, the paper uses the attraction effect paradigm to counteract the single victim effect and reduce the conflict. Experiment 1 demonstrates that in a two-alternative context the majority of participants choose to help one woman by giving €150 instead of helping three women by giving €450. Experiment 2 replicates this finding and highlights the role of emotion regulation strategies in the management of the emotional conflict arising in the two-alternative condition. In both studies, the introduction of a third, dominated alternative reduces the conflict and makes it easier to choose the programme asking for a higher donation and helping three women. Implications for charitable donations and the role of the conflict between moral intuitions and economic costs are discussed. © 2012 Copyright Psychology Press Ltd.","Rubaltelli, E.; Agnoli, S.",Cogn.

Engaging in prosocial behavior explains how high self-control relates to more life satisfaction: Evidence from three Chinese samples,"High levels of self-control are found to be associated with greater life satisfaction. To further understand this relationship, the current study examined two questions: (1) whether too much self-control reduces, rather than increases, life satisfaction, as argued by some scholars; and (2) whether engaging in prosocial behavior explains the ""self-control-life satisfaction"" link. To this end, we conducted survey research among adolescents (N = 1,009), university students (N = 2,620), and adult workers (N = 500). All participants answered the same self-control and life satisfaction measures, whereas prosocial behavior was assessed using different scales across samples. Results of two-line regressions failed to reveal significant inverted-U shaped association between self-control and life satisfaction across samples. Moreover, results of mediation analyses showed that across samples, high levels of self-control were related to greater life satisfaction and this association was partly mediated by prosocial behavior. In conclusion, there is no evidence showing that too much self-control impairs life satisfaction. Engaging in prosocial behavior partly explains how high self-control relates to greater well-being. © 2019 Dou et al.

Results showed that dictators were more selfish when allocating tangible (money) than less tangible (honor credits) endowments. Selfishness was higher when large amounts of money were involved. The certainty of the recipient was manipulated by whether the recipient was chosen and announced before or after the decision. Unexpectedly, participants were more self-interested in the certain-recipient condition than in the uncertain-recipient condition. In the honor condition, the amount of an endowment and the certainty of the recipient did not affect participants' allocations. © Psychological Reports 2014.","Chang, S.-C.; Lin, L.-Y.; Horng, R.-Y.; Wang, Y.-D.",Psychol.

"Shame, guilt & responses to non-profit & public sector ads","Despite their regular use and obvious importance for social marketing, guilt appeals have received scant attention from academic researchers in the marketing communications field. The handful of studies actually completed in this area tend to suggest that, although guilty feelings are easily aroused by appropriate advertising messages, the effectiveness of guilt-based advertising is extremely limited, especially for high-guilt communications. This paper challenges the latter proposition, arguing that the dichotomy between guilt and shame commonly applied in psychological (as opposed to marketing) research is equally relevant for investigations into the efficacy of advertising. It is proposed that certain communications intended to invoke guilt might in fact produce shameful responses among message recipients, with negative consequences for advertisers. © 1998, Advertising Association.","Bennett, R.",Int.

To test the claim that religious symbolism has an effect on sociality, we conducted the Random Allocation Game with a symbolic prime in Pesqueiro, on the island of Marajó, Brazil, among Christians. Our prime–a Bible and a crucifix pendant–appears to have influenced the allocations made toward distant co-religionists; people who played the game in the prime condition allocated more coins to the distant co-religionist. Additionally, self-reported beliefs about God’s knowledge and punishment had strong effects on fair gameplay across games. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Cohen, E.; Baimel, A.; Purzycki, B.G.",Relig.

Findings indicate that requesters expect that obstacles based on the target's inability to provide the resource are more frequent in the discourse of refusals than are obstacles grounded in the target's unwillingness to assist. When the relationship between perceived intimacy and the type of obstacles present is examined, a greater number of inability obstacles are expected to be present as intimacy increases while fewer unwillingness obstacles are expected to be present as intimacy increases. These relationships do not hold for the types of obstacles expected to be expressed in refusals. The discussion explores how expressed and unexpressed obstacles may affect the creation of request discourse. © 1994, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Results suggest that U.S. higher education, hospital, and scientific research NPOs fund-raise to the point where the marginal fund-raising dollar brings in zero dollars of donations, donor demand for output of hospitals and scientific research NPOs is price inelastic and price elastic, respectively, and results are not sensitive to specification of price. © 2004 International Society for Third-Sector Research and The Johns Hopkins University.","Marudas, N.P.; Jacobs, F.A.",Voluntas,1754

"A meta-analysis of the past 25 years of weight loss research using diet, exercise or diet plus exercise intervention","OBJECTIVE: The therapeutic effectiveness of diet, exercise, and diet plus exercise for weight loss in obesity was determined. DATA SOURCES: All human research reported in English, published in peer-reviewed scientific journals within the past 25 y was reviewed. STUDY SELECTION: Acceptance criteria (n = 493 from > 700 studies) were that a therapeutic intervention of diet, exercise or diet plus exercise was employed, specifically for weight reduction in obese adult humans and that weight change was reported numerically. Only aerobic exercise studies were included, while drug, hormone and surgical treatments were excluded. DATA EXTRACTION: All data were extracted by the same investigator from the original research report. Except for gender and program type, all extracted data were numerical. DATA SYNTHESIS: ANOVA, with a Newman-Keuls post hoc test, was used to determine differences among programs (P < 0.05). One analysis was performed on the group mean data and one based on effect sizes. Analyses were repeated using initial body weight, initial percent body fat and program length, as covariates. RESULTS: Primarily, subjects aged 40 y have been studied (39.5 +/- 0.4 y, mean +/- s.e.m.) who are only moderately obese (92.7 +/- 0.9 kg, 33.2 +/- 0.5 body mass index (BMI), 33.4 +/- 0.7% body fat); for short durations (15.6 +/- 0.6 weeks). Exercise studies were of a shorter duration, used younger subjects who weighed less, had lower BMI and percentage body fat values, than diet or diet plus exercise studies. Despite these differences, weight lost through diet, exercise and diet plus exercise was 10.7 +/- 0.5, 2.9 +/- 0.4* and 11.0 +/- 0.6 kg, respectively. However, at one-year follow-up, diet plus exercise tended to be the superior program. Effect size and covariate analyses revealed similar program differences. CONCLUSION: Weight loss research over the past 25 y has been very narrowly focused on a middle age population that is only moderately obese, while the interventions lasted for only short periods of time. The data shows, however, that a 15-week diet or diet plus exercise program, produces a weight loss of about 11 kg, with a 6.6 +/- 0.5 and 8.6 +/- 0.8 kg maintained loss after one year, respectively.","Miller, W C; Koceja, D M; Hamilton, E J",Int.

Uncovering the moral heuristics of altruism: A philosophical scale,"Extant research suggests that individuals employ traditional moral heuristics to support their observed altruistic behavior; yet findings have largely been limited to inductive extrapolation and rely on relatively few traditional frames in so doing, namely, deontology in organizational behavior and virtue theory in law and economics. Given that these and competing moral frames such as utilitarianism can manifest as identical behavior, we develop a moral framing instrument-the Philosophical Moral-Framing Measure (PMFM)-to expand and distinguish traditional frames associated and disassociated with observed altruistic behavior. The validation of our instrument based on 1015 subjects in 3 separate real stakes scenarios indicates that heuristic forms of deontology, virtue-theory, and utilitarianism are strongly related to such behavior, and that egoism is an inhibitor. It also suggests that deontic and virtue-theoretical frames may be commonly perceived as intertwined and opens the door for new research on self-abnegation, namely, a perceived moral obligation toward suffering and self-denial. These findings hold the potential to inform ongoing conversations regarding organizational citizenship and moral crowding out, namely, how financial incentives can undermine altruistic behavior. © 2020 Friedland et al.

Assessing macro-level predictors and theories of crime: A meta-analysis,"The macro-level approach reemerged as a salient criminological paradigm in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Prompted by new theories and reformulations of existing ones, over 200 empirical studies explored ecological correlates of crime. Few efforts have been made, however, to ""make sense"" of this literature. A ""meta-analysis"" was undertaken to determine the relative effects of macro-level predictors of crime. Indicators of ""concentrated disadvantage"" (e.g., racial heterogeneity, poverty, and family disruption) are among the strongest and most stable predictors. Except for incarceration, variables indicating increased use of the criminal justice system (e.g., policing and gettough policy effects) are among the weakest. Across all studies, social disorganization and resource/economic deprivation theories receive strong empirical support; anomie/strain, social support/social altruism, and routine activity theories receive moderate support; and deterrence/rational choice and subcultural theories receive weak support. © 2005 by The University of Chicago.

Patients' experiences on donation of their residual biological samples and the impact of these experiences on the type of consent given for the future research use of the tissue: a systematic review,"AIM: This review aimed to critically appraise, synthesise and present the best available evidence related to the experiences of patients who have donated their residual biological samples and the impact of this experience on the type of consent given for future research use of these tissues. METHOD: The three-step search strategy aimed to find both published and unpublished studies published in English between 1990 and 2010 in electronic databases (PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus, Embase, PsycINFO, Mednar, PROQUEST). Using the standardised data extraction tool from the Joanna Briggs Institute, the Qualitative Assessment and Review Instrument, 131 findings were extracted from the 18 papers included in this review. These findings generated 19 categories and four synthesised findings. RESULTS: The synthesised findings generated were related to the different stages of the handling of leftover tissue. The first synthesised finding: patient consent to the use of leftover tissue is a complex interaction between many factors and not solely driven by perceptions of benefits to self or others, relates to the collection of the leftover tissue - the initial consent process. The second synthesised finding: healthcare institutions and regulatory authorities must provide clear and transparent safeguards and controls, and communicate these to the patient prior to the consenting process, outlines the issues affecting consent during the processing and storage of the tissues in biobanks or research institutions. The third synthesised finding: views on ownership and rights to the further use of the leftover tissue varies between individual patients and influences their willingness to consent to further use, demonstrates the concerns relating to the safeguards on the collection and storage of leftover tissue. The fourth synthesised finding: patients have opposing views on the use of their leftover tissue for commercial purposes, reflecting the differing community beliefs around using leftover tissue for research which may provide a commercial benefit to some, but not all, the community. CONCLUSION: For leftover tissues to be used, patients must clearly understand: the type of consent they are providing (opt in or opt out); the parameters for the future research use of their leftover tissues; the safeguards put into place to protect the individual and the donated tissue from unethical use; and the commercial implications of their consent. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This review provides information on patient's experiences on the collection, storage, distribution and future use of leftover tissue. These preferences need to be understood when designing a prospective model of consent regimen which respects patient's confidentiality and wishes. The information in this review is especially important for policy-makers designing a prospective model of consent regimen for the use of existing and previously collected biological samples with no consent taken. IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH: Further research is needed to ascertain what factors specifically influence patient's willingness to consent for the use of leftover tissue. Factors for further exploration include the effects of culture, religion and age. Additionally, further research is required to inform the development of specific consent regimes for the use of leftover tissue for commercial, stem cell and genetic research.","Chan, Tuck Wai; Mackey, Sandra; Hegney, Desley Gail",Int.

The Case for Moral Consumption: Examining and Expanding the Domain of Moral Behavior to Promote Individual and Collective Well-Being,"This research delineates and critically examines extant empirical research on marketplace morality within the context of transformative consumer research. The authors identify how public policy can be leveraged to promote moral consumption in the marketplace in line with the transformative consumer research objectives of personal and collective well-being. They conduct a systematic review of the last decade of marketing literature and find that the definition of what is considered ?marketplace morality? has been rather narrow. Subsequently, the authors propose a broader definition and develop a typology of moral consumption behaviors based on the valence of moral judgment/behavior (moral or immoral) and moral content (harm, fairness, loyalty, authority, and purity). The authors find that most research has focused on understanding one-time (im)moral behaviors in narrow domains, which have local implications and short-term impact. This research proposes that there is untapped potential in investigating repeated (im)moral behaviors associated with lifestyle choices and habits and that these have wider, long-term moral implications (e.g., wastefulness, overindulgence, pollution, authenticity, discrimination). Finally, the authors consider the underlying motivations for (im)moral behaviors and offer recommendations for policy development and research.","Komarova Loureiro, Yuliya; Bayuk, Julia; Tignor, Stefanie M; Nenkov, Gergana Y; Baskentli, Sara; Webb, Dave",Journal of Public Policy & Marketing,1760

Methodological and Reporting Errors in Meta-Analytic Reviews Make Other Meta-Analysts Angry: A Commentary on Ferguson (2015),"Although Ferguson’s (2015, this issue) meta-analysis addresses an important topic, we have serious concerns about how it was conducted. Because there was only one coder, we have no confidence in the reliability or validity of the coded variables. Two independent raters should have coded the studies. Ferguson synthesized partial correlations as if they were zero-order correlations, which can increase or decrease (sometimes substantially) the variance of the partial correlation. Moreover, he partialled different numbers of variables from different effects, partialled different variables from different studies, and did not report what was partialled from each study.

Update of a Systematic Review of Autoresuscitation After Cardiac Arrest,"OBJECTIVES: There has been a growth in publications focusing on the phenomena of autoresuscitation in recent years. In 2010, we systematically reviewed the medical literature with the primary objective of summarizing the evidence on the timing of autoresuscitation. Healthcare professionals have continued to voice concerns regarding the potential for autoresuscitation. With this in mind, the objective of this brief report is to update the results of our original review of autoresuscitation. DATA SOURCES: We applied the same search strategy described in our original article to update our findings to include articles published from January 2009 to September 2016. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: We screened an additional 1,859 citations, after duplicates were removed, and then assessed 46 full-text articles for eligibility, from which 15 studies were included for data extraction. DATA SYNTHESIS: During the time period of this review, there have been 1) 10 additional adult and three pediatric case reports of autoresuscitation in patients after cessation of cardiopulmonary resuscitation; in those cases with continuous monitoring and confirmation of circulation, the longest events are reported to be 10 and 2 minutes, respectively for adults and children; 2) six adults (4%, total n = 162) with autoresuscitation events reported from two observational studies and one chart review of patients undergoing withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy; the longest time reported to be 89 seconds with electrocardiogram and invasive arterial blood pressure monitoring and 3 minutes with electrocardiogram monitoring only; 3) 12 pediatric patients studied with vital sign monitoring during withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy without any reports of autoresuscitation. CONCLUSIONS: Although case reports of autoresuscitation are hampered by variability in observation and monitoring techniques, autoresuscitation has now been reported in adults and children, and there appears to be a distinction in timing between failed cardiopulmonary resuscitation and withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy. Although additional prospective studies are required to clarify the frequency and predisposing factors associated with this phenomenon, clinical decision-making regarding patient management under uncertainty is required nonetheless. Both adult and pediatric healthcare professionals should be aware of the possibility of autoresuscitation and monitor their patients accordingly before diagnosing death.","Hornby, Laura; Dhanani, Sonny; Shemie, Sam D",Crit.

Analysis of the Value of Celebrity Affiliation to Nonprofit Contributions,"Nonprofit organizations rely on contributions to achieve mission-based objectives. While many determinants of contributions have been uncovered (e.g., fundraising budget, organization age, and operational efficiency), little is known about the role that celebrity affiliation plays in generating contributions. Using a sample of more than 500 industry-diverse charities with known celebrity affiliations, we find support for the celebrity-lift hypothesis—that celebrity-affiliated nonprofits are associated with increased contributions. We also find that celebrity affiliation has a substitution effect such that fundraising expenses are lower at celebrity-affiliated organizations. © 2014, © The Author(s) 2014.","Harris, E.E.; Ruth, J.A.",Nonprofit Volunt.

"The Relationships Among Girls’ Prosocial Video Gaming, Perspective-Taking, Sympathy, and Thoughts About Violence","This study, which was based on the General Learning Model, examined the effects of prosocial gaming on girls’ thoughts about perceived justified and unjustified aggressive attitudes as operationalized by 4 scenarios. The process was mediated by participants’ general perspective-taking and sympathy abilities, which relate to the cognitive and affective routes to learning. Structural equation modeling was used to examine the process. One hundred and forty-five girls between the ages of 7 and 15 completed the self-report online survey. Findings suggest that prosocial gaming is associated with greater perspective-taking and sympathizing abilities. These abilities positively correlated with thoughts about all types of violence as wrong whether or not “justified” and independent of severity. Error correlations suggest that younger girls’ processing comprises an affective component that bypasses the cognitive or perspective-taking route. Findings also intimate that in the case of justified violence assessments, girls not only evaluated the aggressor’s violent act but also assessed what precipitated the act thus suggesting more complex thought. © The Author(s) 2012.","Vieira, E.T., Jr.",Commun.

Processing of the incentive for social approval in the ventral striatum during charitable donation,"Human behaviors are motivated not only by materialistic rewards but also by abstract social rewards, such as the approval of others. When choosing an action in social situations, to evaluate each action, the brain must convert different types of reward (such as money or social approval) into a common scale. Here using fMRI, we investigated the neural correlates of such valuation computations while individuals freely decided whether to donate to real charities or to take the money for themselves in the presence or absence of observers. Behavioral evidence showed that the mere presence of observers increased donation rates, and neuroimaging results revealed that activation in the ventral striatum before the same choice (""donate"" or ""not donate"") was significantly modulated by the presence of observers. Particularly high striatal activations were observed when a high social reward was expected (donation in public) and when there was the potential for monetary gain without social cost (no donation in the absence of observers). These findings highlight the importance of this area in representing both social and monetary rewards as a ""decision utility"" and add to the understanding of how the brain makes a choice using a ""common neural currency"" in social situations. © 2009 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.","Izuma, K.; Saito, D.N.; Sadato, N.",J.

Using crowdsourced online experiments to study context-dependency of behavior,"We use Mechanical Turk's diverse participant pool to conduct online bargaining games in India and the US. First, we assess internal validity of crowdsourced experimentation through variation of stakes ($0, $1, $4, and $10) in the Ultimatum and Dictator Game. For cross-country equivalence we adjust the stakes following differences in purchasing power. Our marginal totals correspond closely to laboratory findings. Monetary incentives induce more selfish behavior but, in line with most laboratory findings, the particular size of a positive stake appears irrelevant. Second, by transporting a homogeneous decision situation into various living conditions crowdsourced experimentation permits identification of context effects on elicited behavior. We explore context-dependency using session-level variation in participants' geographical location, regional affluence, and local social capital. Across “virtual pools” behavior varies in the range of stake effects. We argue that quasi-experimental variation of the characteristics people bring to the experimental situation is the key potential of crowdsourced online designs. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Keuschnigg, M.; Bader, F.; Bracher, J.",Soc.

Improved docking of polypeptides with glide,"Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein-protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM-GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach. © 2013 American Chemical Society.","Tubert-Brohman, I.; Sherman, W.; Repasky, M.; Beuming, T.",J.

An assessment of the methodological quality of published network meta-analyses: a systematic review,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the methodological quality of published network meta-analysis. DESIGN: Systematic review. METHODS: We searched the medical literature for network meta-analyses of pharmaceuticals. We assessed general study characteristics, study transparency and reproducibility, methodological approach, and reporting of findings. We compared studies published in journals with lower impact factors with those published in journals with higher impact factors, studies published prior to January 1st, 2013 with those published after that date, and studies supported financially by industry with those supported by non-profit institutions or that received no support. RESULTS: The systematic literature search identified 854 citations. Three hundred and eighteen studies met our inclusion criteria. The number of network meta-analyses has grown rapidly, with 48% of studies published since January 2013. The majority of network meta-analyses were supported by a non-profit institution or received no support (68%). We found considerable inconsistencies among reviewed studies. Eighty percent reported search terms, 61% a network diagram, 65% sufficient data to replicate the analysis, and 90% the characteristics of included trials. Seventy percent performed a risk of bias assessment of included trials, 40% an assessment of model fit, and 56% a sensitivity analysis. Among studies with a closed loop, 69% examined the consistency of direct and indirect evidence. Sixty-four percent of studies presented the full matrix of head-to-head treatment comparisons. For Bayesian studies, 41% reported the probability that each treatment was best, 31% reported treatment ranking, and 16% included the model code or referenced publicly-available code. Network meta-analyses published in higher impact factors journals and those that did not receive industry support performed better across the assessment criteria. We found few differences between older and newer studies. CONCLUSIONS: There is substantial variation in the network meta-analysis literature. Consensus among guidelines is needed improve the methodological quality, transparency, and consistency of study conduct and reporting.","Chambers, James D; Naci, Huseyin; Wouters, Olivier J; Pyo, Junhee; Gunjal, Shalak; Kennedy, Ian R; Hoey, Mark G; Winn, Aaron; Neumann, Peter J",PLoS One,1772
Motivators to participation in actual HIV vaccine trials,"An examination of actual HIV vaccine trials can contribute to an understanding of motivators for participation in these studies. Analysis of these motivators reveals that they can be categorized as social and personal benefits. Social benefits are generally altruistic, whereas personal benefits are psychological, physical, and financial. In this systematic review, the authors performed a literature search for actual preventive HIV vaccine trials reporting motivators to participation. Of studies conducted in the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, the authors retrieved 12 studies reporting on social benefits and seven reporting on personal benefits. From the non-OECD countries, nine studies reported on social benefits and eight studies on personal benefits. Social benefits were most frequently described on macroscopic, altruistic levels. Personal benefits were most frequently psychological in nature. Rates of participation were compared between the OECD and the non-OECD countries. Knowledge of actual motivators in specific countries and regions can help target recruitment in various types of actual HIV vaccine trials.","Dhalla, Shayesta; Poole, Gary",AIDS Behav.,1773
The not-so-dark side of materialism: Can public versus private contexts make materialists less eco-unfriendly?,"Materialism, a way of life characterized by pursuing possessions, image, and status, has always been looked upon as self-interested and unkind. Previous studies have widely verified that materialism has a negative impact on individuals' pro-environmental behaviors. The present research focused on whether the public (versus private) nature of a decision context will make materialists behave in more eco-friendly ways. In Study 1, the behavioral decision context (public vs. private) was manipulated to examine whether the relationship between materialism and pro-environmental behaviors would vary as a function of the situation. In Study 2, we manipulated materialism and contexts simultaneously to verify the hypothesis again. Findings in the two studies consistently revealed that public versus private contexts played a moderating role between materialism and pro-environmental behaviors. That is, in private, individuals with higher levels of materialism were less eco-friendly than those with lower levels of materialism, but the negative effect disappeared in public. We concluded with a discussion of the theoretical and practical implications of the research findings. © 2019 Wang, Gu, Jiang and Sun.","Wang, L.; Gu, D.; Jiang, J.; Sun, Y.",Front. Psychol.,1774
Happy to help? A systematic review and meta-analysis of the effects of performing acts of kindness on the well-being of the actor,"Do acts of kindness improve the well-being of the actor? Recent advances in the behavioural sciences have provided a number of explanations of human social, cooperative and altruistic behaviour. These theories predict that people will be ‘happy to help’ family, friends, community members, spouses, and even strangers under some conditions. Here we conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the experimental evidence that kindness interventions (for example, performing ‘random acts of kindness’) boost subjective well-being. Our initial search of the literature identified 489 articles; of which 24 (27 studies) met the inclusion criteria (total N/=/4045). These 27 studies, some of which included multiple control conditions and dependent measures, yielded 52 effect sizes. Multi-level modeling revealed that the overall effect of kindness on the well-being of the actor is small-to-medium (´/=/0.28). The effect was not moderated by sex, age, type of participant, intervention, control condition or outcome measure. There was no indication of publication bias. We discuss the limitations of the current literature, and recommend that future research test more specific theories of kindness: taking kindness-specific individual differences into account; distinguishing between the effects of kindness to specific categories of people; and considering a wider range of proximal and distal outcomes. Such research will advance our understanding of the causes and consequences of kindness, and help practitioners to maximise the effectiveness of kindness interventions to improve well-being.

Applying Social Psychology to Induce Charitable Donations,"As part of a door‐to‐door campaign to raise funds for the American Cancer Society, 359 people in a middle‐class neighborhood were randomly assigned to five different versions of a request for contributions. A version of the request similar to that typically used in such charity drives served as a control and the other four versions were modified slightly on the basis of social psychological principles. Three of these manipulations failed to increase donating beyond the level of the standard request. Replicating prior research, it was found that for completed requests (N= 293) adding the words “even a penny will help” to the standard request significantly increased the percentage of people who donated. However, in 66 cases the solicitor was interrupted with a donation or a refusal before delivering the key phrase that differentiated the experimental conditions. An analysis of these incomplete requests suggests that the effectiveness of the even‐a‐penny technique may be at least partially explained by the solicitors' expectations.

Reciprocity and the emergence of reputation,"Before reputation can be cultivated it must be conferred; individuals must seek information relevant to a future social partner prior to actual interaction. Such information may be gathered by observing a future social partner in interaction with another. Use of vicarious observation to direct initial play in actual encounter we term minimal attributed reputation. We model minimal attributed reputation by the strategy Observer Tit For Tat (OTFT), which behaves like Tit For Tat (TFT) when ignorant of a new partner but begins by defecting on a new partner if that partner was seen defecting on another. TFT can resist invasion by OTFT in the presence of recurring mutant unilateral defectors. Yet OTFT is evolutionarily stable when TFT is not; similarly, OTFT requires less clustering than TFT to invade a world of unilateral defection. OTFT is evolutionarily superior to TFT under low probabilities of future interaction between partners; indeed, in principle OTFT requires no future interaction between partners. As the probability of future interaction increases, TFT supplants OTFT. Thus, minimal reputation evolves when the duration of pair-wise interaction is relatively uncertain. © 1992 Academic Press Limited All rights reserved.","Pollock, G.; Dugatkin, L.A.",J. Theor.

Did tax incentives play any part in increased giving?,"Since 2000, increased taxation incentives along with other measures have been used by the government to encourage philanthropy in Australia. Since the new incentives were introduced, claimed gift tax deductions have increased. However, generally, donors are not aware of the new tax incentives for giving and in any case they report that their motivation for giving is not primarily, if at all, to obtain tax incentives. This article examines this paradox and seeks some possible explanations.","McGregor-Lowndes, M.; Newton, C.; Marsden, S.",Austr. J. Soc. Iss.,1778
Gifts and Gifting,"The terms gift and gifting are rarely formally defined, but are associated with something given without receiving payment, often in the expectation of reciprocation and of changing the relationship with the recipient. Extensive prior work across a number of disciplines tends to focus on gifting as a process and shows a broad conceptualization of the gift construct to include actions as diverse as charitable giving, tipping, self-gifting and volunteering, where relationship development and reciprocation are largely irrelevant. As a way to develop the area, two proposals are made: first, that gifting research should recognize two different types of gift, transactional and relational; and second, that the exchange paradigm and its underpinning social exchange theory should become central in developing understanding of relational gifting. The authors argue that empirical researchers may usefully revisit the relational paradigm, but by adopting a more quantitative, modelling approach, and the paper illustrates how this might be achieved. © 2009 The Authors.

"Prevalence of hepatitis G virus infection among 67,348 blood donors in mainland China","BACKGROUND: Hepatitis G virus (HGV) infection transmitted from blood donors is a concern in China, as many articles about HGV infection in Chinese blood donors from different provinces have been published. This study aimed to evaluate the overall prevalence of HGV infection in Chinese blood donors and analyse the potential risk of HGV infection through blood transfusion in China. METHODS: We performed a literature search in PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, the Chinese BioMedical Literature Database (CBM) and the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) up to October 2018 regarding the prevalence of HGV in Chinese blood donors. Eligibility assessment and data extraction were conducted independently by 2 researchers, and meta-analysis was performed to synthesize the data. Heterogeneity was evaluated using Cochran's Q test and quantified using the I2 statistic. Subgroup analyses were performed to identify the possible sources of heterogeneity. Publication bias was assessed using both funnel plot and Egger's tests. RESULTS: A total of 102 studies with 67,348 blood donors published from 1996 to 2016 and covering 26 provinces or municipalities were included for further analyses. The pooled prevalence of HGV was 3.91% (95%CI: 3.18-4.71%) by enzyme immune assay/enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (EIA/ELISA) and 3.25% (95%CI: 2.35-4.26%) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The prevalence of HGV may be significantly affected by region, province or municipality and potentially by the paid/voluntary status of the blood donors. No significant difference was found between plasma and full blood donation. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of HGV in blood donors from China was similar to that in blood donors from many other countries and higher than that of some other hepatitis viruses, such as hepatitis B virus. The risk of transfusion-transmitted HGV still exists after routine blood donor screening, especially in those patients coinfected with other hepatitis viruses and/or HIV. On the basis of our study, we may suggest adding HGV screening for blood transfusions in mainland China in the future.","Wang, Taiwu; Chen, Juecai; Zhang, Qi; Huang, Xia; Xie, Nanzhen; Zhang, Jinhai; Cai, Tongjian; Zhang, Yao; Xiong, Hongyan",BMC Public Health,1780

"What are the most powerful predictors of charitable giving to victims of typhoon Haiyan: Prosocial traits, socio-demographic variables, or eye cues?","Major natural disasters often prompt charities to start rallying for extra donations. However, little is known about which variables predict disaster donations most strongly. Here we focused on donations to victims of typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines (2013). A multifaceted approach combined three potential predictors: (a) prosocial traits (social value orientation and social mindfulness, or SVO and SoMi), (b) socio-demographic variables, and (c) minimal social cues (eye images). Participants (N = 643) completed an online survey in which they decided whether or not to spend time on a fundraising task to support the typhoon victims. Results of this exploratory study showed that SVO and SoMi, followed by educational attainment and political ideology, were the most prominent predictors of the decision to donate. Furthermore, SVO, SoMi, educational attainment, and religiosity were related to the donated amount. In disaster relief appeals, prosocial personality (and certain socio-demographic factors) might be a more important predictor of helping behavior than exposure to eye images. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Manesi, Z.; Van Lange, P.A.M.; Van Doesum, N.J.; Pollet, T.V.",Pers.

Positivity effect and decision making in ageing,"Across various contexts, older adults demonstrate a positivity effect–an age-related increase in a relative bias toward positive emotional stimuli as compared to negative stimuli. Previous research has demonstrated how this effect can influence decision making processes, specifically information search and choice satisfaction. However, the potential impact of the positivity effect and resulting age differences in information acquisition on decision quality has not been conclusively determined. We conducted an online decision making study comprising choices among charitable organisations with 152 younger and 152 older adults to investigate this relationship. We did not observe the positivity effect defined as higher positivity bias in older compared to younger adults. On the contrary, younger adults showed a slightly higher positivity bias. We also did not observe a link between a bias in information search toward positive or negative stimuli and decision quality. The results replicate the link between positivity bias and decision satisfaction. Older and younger adults did not differ in their decision quality. Finally, the findings did not support a potential influence of loss prevention orientation. Further research is required to address the factors that could influence the positivity effect in decision making. © 2021 The Author(s).

The selfish side of self-control,"Self-control is a powerful tool that promotes goal pursuit by helping individuals curb personal desires, follow norms, and adopt rational thinking. In interdependent social contexts, the socially acceptable (i.e. normative) and rational approach to secure long-term goals is prosocial behaviour. Consistent with that, much research associates self-control with prosociality. The present research demonstrates that when norm salience is reduced (i.e. social relations are no longer interdependent), high self-control leads to more selfish behaviour when it is economically rational. In three studies, participants were asked to allocate an endowment between themselves and another person (one-round, zero-sum version of the dictator game), facing a conflict between a socially normative and an economically rational approach. Across the studies, norm salience was manipulated [through manipulation of social context (private/public; Studies 1 and 2), measurement of social desirability (Studies 1 and 3), and measurement (Study 2) and manipulation (Study 3) of social power] such that some participants experienced low normative pressure. Findings showed that among individuals in a low normative pressure context, self-control led to economically rational, yet selfish, behaviour. The findings highlight the role of self-control in regulating behaviour so as to maximize situational adaptation. © 2014 European Association of Personality Psychology.","Uziel, L.; Hefetz, U.",Eur.

Impact of Government Funding on Donations to Arts Organizations: A Survey Experiment,"Many nonprofits rely on private donations and government grants, but it is still unclear how these sources of funding may interact or even influence each other. To examine the behavioral aspect of the crowding-out hypothesis, we conducted an online survey experiment (n = 562) to test if government funding of a hypothetical nonprofit would influence donations. Our results show that a nonprofit with government funding, compared to an identical hypothetical organization without government funding, received 25% less in average donations (US$35 vs. US$47) and was about half as likely (21% vs. 38%) to receive all the money in a forced-choice scenario. However, the crowding-out effect of government funding appears much weaker for those who are arts patrons or who have previously contributed to the arts. Interestingly, this crowding-out effect seems insensitive to the amount of government funding and to labeling the government funding as coming from a prestigious source (e.g., National Endowment for the Arts [NEA]). © The Author(s) 2013.","Kim, M.; Van Ryzin, G.G.",Nonprofit Volunt.

The lure of antagonistic social strategy in unstable socioecological environment: Residential mobility facilitates individuals’ antisocial behavior,"Individuals are believed to calibrate their antisocial level in response to the socioecological environment where they live. However, knowledge of the relationship between specific socioecological factors and antisocial behavior remains scant. This research focused on humans’ residential mobility and explored its influence on antisocial behavior. Three studies were designed to test the hypothesis that individuals with high (vs. low) residential mobility tend to engage in antisocial behavior more frequently. The results showed that both self-reported residential mobility (Study 1) and manipulated residential mobility (Studies 2 and 3) positively predicted individuals’ antisocial level. Furthermore, we found that social monitoring played a role in moderating the linkage between residential mobility and antisocial behavior (Study 3); individuals with high residential mobility decreased their antisocial behavior when they were observed by artificial eyes, while individuals with low residential mobility did the opposite. Taken together, this research suggests that, generally speaking, residential mobility is one socioecological factor that increases antisocial behavior, and that social monitoring can have diverse effects on such behavior. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Zuo, S.; Huang, N.; Cai, P.; Wang, F.",Evol.

Social Motivation: Costs and Benefits of Selfishness and Otherishness,"We examine recent evidence on the consequences of selfishness and otherishness for psychological well-being, physical health, and relationships. In the first sections, we consider recent evidence regarding the costs and benefits of giving time, money, and support to others and the costs and benefits of taking or receiving those things from others. Then, because the behaviors of giving and taking can be motivated either by selfish or otherish concerns, we next consider the costs and benefits of the motivation underlying giving and taking. We also examine why and for whom selfishness and otherishness have consequences for psychological well-being, physical health, and relationships. We focus on mechanisms identified in research, including intrapsychic mechanisms such as positive and negative affect, self-esteem and self-efficacy, a sense of meaning and purpose in life, and a sense of connectedness to or isolation from others, as well as interpersonal processes such as reciprocation of support and responsiveness. © Copyright 2017 by Annual Reviews.

Perinatel outcomes of singleton pregnancies achieved by in vitro fertilization: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the incidence of adverse obstetric outcomes is higher in singleton pregnancies achieved by in vitro fertilization (IVF) than in spontaneously conceived singletons matched for maternal age. METHODS: We used comprehensive search strategies to search MEDLINE and EMBASE databases. We selected case-control and cohort studies that compared singleton pregnancies conceived by IVF or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) with spontaneously conceived singletons (matched for maternal age [case-control studies] or controlled for maternal age [cohort studies]). Two reviewers independently assessed titles, abstracts, and study quality and extracted data. Statistical analysis was performed with Review Manager for Windows (Version 4.2, Oxford, UK). We performed meta-analysis of dichotomous data, using odds ratios (ORs) as measures of effect size, with a random effects model. We followed the Meta-Analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines for meta-analysis of observational studies. RESULTS: Singleton pregnancies resulting from IVF have increased rates of poor obstetric outcome, compared with spontaneously conceived singletons matched for maternal age, with increases in perinatal mortality (OR 2.40; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.59-3.63), preterm birth at < 33 weeks' gestation (OR 2.99; 95% CI 1.54-5.80), preterm birth at < 37 weeks' gestation (OR 1.93; 95% CI 1.36-2.74), very low birth weight (< 1500 g) (OR 3.78; 95% CI 4.29-5.75), small for gestational age (OR 1.59; 95% CI 1.20-2.11), and congenital malformations (OR 1.41; CI 1.06-1.88).

The distributed human neural system for face perception,"Face perception, perhaps the most highly developed visual skill in humans, is mediated by a distributed neural system in humans that is comprised of multiple, bilateral regions. We propose a model for the organization of this system that emphasizes a distinction between the representation of invariant and changeable aspects of faces. The representation of invariant aspects of faces underlies the recognition of individuals, whereas the representation of changeable aspects of faces, such as eye gaze, expression, and lip movement, underlies the perception of information that facilitates social communication. The model is also hierarchical insofar as it is divided into a core system and an extended system. The core system is comprised of occipitotemporal regions in extrastriate visual cortex that mediate the visual analysis of faces. In the core system, the representation of invariant aspects is mediated more by the face-responsive region in the fusiform gyrus, whereas the representation of changeable aspects is mediated more by the face-responsive region in the superior temporal sulcus. The extended system is comprised of regions from neural systems for other cognitive functions that can be recruited to act in concert with the regions in the core system to extract meaning from faces.","Haxby, J.V.; Hoffman, E.A.; Gobbini, M.I.",Trends Cogn.

Our results suggest that dictators have been nudged into demonstrating altruistic tendencies in the standard DG, just as our taking treatment has nudged dictators to become thieves. © 2010 EEA.","Kench, B.T.; Niman, N.B.",East.

On the anatomy of social engineering attacks—A literature-based dissection of successful attacks,"The aim of this study was to explore the extent to which persuasion principles are used in successful social engineering attacks. Seventy-four scenarios were extracted from 4 books on social engineering (written by social engineers) and analysed. Each scenario was split into attack steps, containing single interactions between offender and target. For each attack step, persuasion principles were identified. The main findings are that (a) persuasion principles are often used in social engineering attacks, (b) authority (1 of the 6 persuasion principles) is used considerably more often than others, and (c) single-principle attack steps occur more often than multiple-principle ones. The social engineers identified in the scenarios more often used persuasion principles compared to other social influences. The scenario analysis illustrates how to exploit the human element in security. The findings support the view that security mechanisms should include not only technical but also social countermeasures.

Prosocial behavior and social status,"Humans are a very prosocial species, in that we often help others even at a cost to ourselves. Such behavior affects- and is affected by-a person's social status. In the current chapter, we examine the interactions between social status and prosocial behavior, and we show that causation goes in both directions. On the one hand, laboratory and field evidence show that prosocial behavior can be a means of achieving, or maintaining, elevated status and accessing the accompanying material and social rewards. On the other hand, possessing status can also affect prosocial behavior (for better or worse) by altering the costs and benefits of prosociality, for example, by affecting people's dependence on others, their vested interest in others, their ability to be prosocial, and their need for status maintenance. Status thus influences the use of prosocial behavior, but can increase it or decrease it depending on the context and the specific type of prosocial behavior. By understanding this bi-directional causation and applying it, we can harness people's desire for status to promote prosocial behaviors by ensuring its visibility and by fostering competitive altruism. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014.

Video Games Do Affect Social Outcomes: A Meta-Analytic Review of the Effects of Violent and Prosocial Video Game Play,"Whether video game play affects social behavior is a topic of debate. Many argue that aggression and helping are affected by video game play, whereas this stance is disputed by others. The present research provides a meta-analytical test of the idea that depending on their content, video games do affect social outcomes. Data from 98 independent studies with 36,965 participants revealed that for both violent video games and prosocial video games, there was a significant association with social outcomes. Whereas violent video games increase aggression and aggression-related variables and decrease prosocial outcomes, prosocial video games have the opposite effects. These effects were reliable across experimental, correlational, and longitudinal studies, indicating that video game exposure causally affects social outcomes and that there are both short- and long-term effects. © 2014 by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc.","Greitemeyer, T.; Mügge, D.O.",Pers.

Hierarchies of Need in Sustainable Development: A Resource Dependence Approach for Local Governance,"Urban sustainability is a burgeoning focus for urban scholarship but rarely examined within the larger context of local government economic activities. Why should cities focusing on cutback management and competition for tax revenues be expected to devote all but the fleetest of attention to carbon footprints or metropolitan-wide environmental or social problems? To address this question, we utilize a resource dependence (RD) theoretical framework to conceptualize sustainable development as a pattern of contractual arrangements between governments and firms shaped by resource constraints. Utilizing survey data of U.S. cities and a Bayesian methodological approach, we present evidence that municipal job-recruitment efforts reduce the probability of observing an overall sustainability policy commitment. Cities which placed greater emphasis on retaining and developing existing businesses are also more committed to sustainability. © The Author(s) 2017.","Deslatte, A.; Stokan, E.",Urban Aff. Rev.,1805
Watching eyes do not stop dogs stealing food: evidence against a general risk-aversion hypothesis for the watching-eye effect,"The presence of pictures of eyes reduces antisocial behaviour in humans. It has been suggested that this ‘watching-eye’ effect is the result of a uniquely human sensitivity to reputation-management cues. However, an alternative explanation is that humans are less likely to carry out risky behaviour in general when they feel like they are being watched. This risk-aversion hypothesis predicts that other animals should also show the watching-eye effect because many animals behave more cautiously when being observed. Dogs are an ideal species to test between these hypotheses because they behave in a risk-averse manner when being watched and attend specifically to eyes when assessing humans’ attentional states. Here, we examined if dogs were slower to steal food in the presence of pictures of eyes compared to flowers. Dogs showed no difference in the latency to steal food between the two conditions. This finding shows that dogs are not sensitive to watching-eyes and is not consistent with a risk-aversion hypothesis for the watching-eye effect. © 2020, The Author(s).","Neilands, P.; Hassall, R.; Derks, F.; Bastos, A.P.M.; Taylor, A.H.",Sci.

Conflict management as an organizational capacity: survey of hospital managers in healthcare organizations,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is twofold. The first objective is to outline the main theoretical framework on the conflict style phenomenon; the second purpose is to understand the conflict style in a sample of Medical Health Manager. Design/methodology/approach: The authors based this research on qualitative-quantitative analysis. This study starts with a survey questionnaire as a method to collect quantitative data. Therefore, the authors conducted a survey on the style of conflict management of hospital managers with subordinates. A modified version of the Rahim Organizational Conflict Inventory II (ROCI II) (Rahim, 1983) – Module B is used. This instrument is composed of 28 entries. Findings: The results of this study offer a double perspective. From a theoretical point of view, the results highlight the main theoretical references related to conflict management. In particular, the main currents of study and the results of empirical evidence have been identified within organizational theory. The empirical part of this study, instead, offers a survey, carried out through the administration of the ROCI II – module B questionnaire. Originality/value: This paper offers interesting food for thought on conflict management. In particular, it offers theoretical references on the subject and on the validation of the ROCI II - Form B model, in health organizations. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Vesperi, W.; Ventura, M.; Cristofaro, C.L.",Measuring Bus.

Meta-analysis in clinical trials,This paper examines eight published reviews each reporting results from several related trials. Each review pools the results from the relevant trials in order to evaluate the efficacy of a certain treatment for a specified medical condition. These reviews lack consistent assessment of homogeneity of treatment effect before pooling. We discuss a random effects approach to combining evidence from a series of experiments comparing two treatments. This approach incorporates the heterogeneity of effects in the analysis of the overall treatment efficacy. The model can be extended to include relevant covariates which would reduce the heterogeneity and allow for more specific therapeutic recommendations. We suggest a simple noniterative procedure for characterizing the distribution of treatment effects in a series of studies. © 1986.,"DerSimonian, R.; Laird, N.",Control. Clin. Trials,1808
The Multidimensional View of Commitment and the Theory of Reasoned Action: A Comparative Evaluation,"This study examined the relative ability of the multidimensional view of commitment and the theory of reasoned action to explain employee intentions and predict work behavior. Variables within the theory of reasoned action were superior to commitment in explaining employee intentions to be punctual and to engage in altruistic acts. However, the theory of reasoned action did not explain unique variance in either volitional behavior (altruism) or in less volitional behavior (tardiness). Finally, foci and bases of employee commitment accounted for significant variance in both altruism and tardiness, and explained variance in both behaviors over and above variables contained within the theory of reasoned action. Implications of these findings for the usefulness of the approaches are discussed.","Becker, Thomas E; Randall, Donna M; Riegel, Carl D",J. Manage.,1809
Kin discrimination and the benefit of helping in cooperatively breeding vertebrates,"In many cooperatively breeding vertebrates, a dominant breeding pair is assisted in offspring care by nonbreeding helpers. A leading explanation for this altruistic behavior is Hamilton's idea that helpers gain indirect fitness benefits by rearing relatives (kin selection). Many studies have shown that helpers typically provide care for relatives, but relatively few have shown that helpers provide closer kin with preferential care (kin discrimination), fueling the suggestion that kin selection only poorly accounts for the evolution of cooperative breeding in vertebrates. We used meta-analysis to show that (i) individuals consistently discriminate between kin, and (ii) stronger discrimination occurs in species where the benefits of helping are greater. These results suggest a general role for kin selection and that the relative importance of kin selection varies across species, as predicted by Hamilton's rule.","Griffin, Ashleigh S; West, Stuart A",Science,1810

Product development public-private partnerships for public health: a systematic review using qualitative data,"Almost a decade ago, public health initiated a number of innovative ventures to attract investments from multinational drug companies for the development of new drugs and vaccines to tackle neglected diseases (NDs). These ventures - known as product development public-private partnerships (PD PPPs) - represent the participation of the public and private actors toward the discovery and development of essential medicines to reduce the suffering of over one billion people worldwide living with NDs. This systematic review aimed to identify empirical-based descriptive articles to understand critical elements in the partnership process, and propose a framework to shed light on future guidelines to support better planning, design and management of existing and new forms of PPPs for public health. Ten articles met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed and synthesized using qualitative content analysis. The findings show that the development stage of PD PPPs requires a careful initiation and planning process including discussion on values and shared goals, agreement on mutual interests & equality of power relation, exchange of expertise & resources, stakeholder engagement, and assessment of the local health capacity. The management stage of PD PPPs entails transparency, extensive communication and participatory decision-making among partner organizations. This review illustrates the difficulties, challenges and effective responses during the partnering process. This model of collaboration may offer a way to advance population health at present, while creating streams of innovation that can yield future social and financial dividends in enhancing the public's health more widely.","De Pinho Campos, Katia; Norman, Cameron D; Jadad, Alejandro R",Soc.

Are expert athletes 'expert' in the cognitive laboratory? A meta-analytic review of cognition and sport expertise,"10.1002/acp.1588.absRecent literature has demonstrated the usefulness of fitness and computer-based cognitive training as a means to enhance cognition and brain function. However, it is unclear whether the combination of fitness and cognitive training that results from years of extensive sport training also results in superior performance on tests of cognitive processes. In this study we examine, in a quantitative meta-analysis (k=20), the relationship between expertise in sports and laboratory-based measures of cognition. We found that athletes performed better on measures of processing speed and a category of varied attentional paradigms, and athletes from interceptive sport types and males showed the largest effects. Based on our results, more research should be done with higher-level cognitive tasks, such as tasks of executive function and more varied sub-domains of visual attention. Furthermore, future studies should incorporate more female athletes and use a diverse range of sport types and levels of expertise. © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Voss, M.W.; Kramer, A.F.; Basak, C.; Prakash, R.S.; Roberts, B.",Appl.

A meta-analysis of neonatal health outcomes from oocyte donation,"Donated oocytes are a treatment modality for female infertility which is also associated with increased risks of preeclampsia. Subsequently it is important to evaluate if there is concomitant increased risks for adverse neonatal events in donated oocyte neonates. A structured search of the literature using PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane Reviews was performed to investigate the perinatal health outcomes of offspring conceived from donor oocytes compared with autologous oocytes. Meta-analysis was performed on comparable outcomes data. Twenty-eight studies were eligible and included in the review, and of these, 23 were included in a meta-analysis. Donor oocyte neonates are at increased risk of being born with low birth weight (<2500 g) [risk ratio (RR): 1.18, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.14-1.22, P-value (P)<0.00001], very low birth weight (<1500 g) (RR: 1.24, CI: 1.15-1.35, P<0.00001), preterm (<37 weeks) (RR: 1.26, CI: 1.23-1.30, P<0.00001), of lower gestational age (mean difference -0.3 weeks, CI: -0.35 weeks to -0.25 weeks, P<0.00001), and preterm with low birth weight (RR: 1.24, CI: 1.19-1.29, P<0.00001), when compared with autologous oocyte neonates. Conversely, low birth weight outcomes were improved in term donor oocyte neonates (RR: 0.86, CI: 0.8-0.93, P=0.0003). These negative outcomes remained significant when controlling for multiple deliveries. The donor oocyte risk rates are higher than those found in general ART outcomes, are important considerations for the counselling of infertile patients and may also influence the long term health of the offspring.","Adams, D H; Clark, R A; Davies, M J; de Lacey, S",J.

Differential susceptibility to rearing environment depending on dopamine-related genes: new evidence and a meta-analysis,"In the current paper we present new empirical data and meta-analytic evidence for the role of dopamine-related genes as a susceptibility factor interacting with the rearing environment for better and for worse, that is, increasing children's susceptibility to both the adverse effects of unsupportive environments and the beneficial effects of supportive rearing. In Study 1 we examined the readiness of 91 7-year-old children to donate their money to a charity (UNICEF). We tested whether the association between attachment and donating behavior was moderated by the presence of the dopamine receptor D4 (DRD4) 7-repeat allele. The attachment story completion task was used to assess attachment as an index of the quality of the rearing environment. Children with secure attachment representations donated more but only if they had the DRD4 7-repeat allele. In Study 2 we present the results of a meta-analysis of gene-environment studies on children up to 10 years of age involving dopamine-related genes (dopamine receptor D2, DRD4, dopamine transporter). The cumulative negative effects of these ""risk genes"" and adverse rearing environments have been stressed, but potentially cumulative positive effects of these same genes interacting with positive rearing environments remained largely unnoticed. We examined the associations between negative and positive rearing environments and developmental outcomes as moderated by dopamine-related gene polymorphisms. Children with the less efficient dopamine-related genes did worse in negative environments than the comparisons without the ""genetic risk,"" but they also profited most from positive environments. Findings are discussed in light of evolutionary theory, and illustrated with some practical implications of differential susceptibility.","Bakermans-Kranenburg, Marian J; van Ijzendoorn, Marinus H",Dev.

Effects of watching eyes and norm cues on charitable giving in a surreptitious behavioral experiment,"A series of experimental studies by multiple groups of researchers have found that displaying images of watching eyes causes people to behave more prosocially. It is not yet clear whether watching eyes increase prosocial motivation per se, or whether they simply make people's behavior more normative. Here, we report results from a surreptitious behavioral experiment examining the impacts of watching eye images and cues to local norms on charitable donations in a controlled setting. Eye images significantly increased average donations. Eye images did not make people conform more closely to the apparent norm overall. Instead, there were different patterns according to the apparent norm. For an apparent norm of small donations, eye images made many participants more generous than the norm. For an apparent norm of large donations, there was an excess of participants giving zero in the no-eyes treatment, which was abolished in the eyes treatment. Our results can be explained by a combination of watching eyes increasing prosocial motivation and reluctance to leave a donation visibly less generous than the norm.","Fathi, M.; Bateson, M.; Nettle, D.",Evol.

Examining the role of fairness in high stakes allocation decisions,"Experimental evidence has prompted a debate over the nature of utility functions in which people are concerned about the amount others earn. We examine this issue by examining behavior across three variants of the dictator game. Using data from 195 dictators allocating as much as $100 each, we observe that the origin of endowments is critically linked to allocation behavior: when subjects could reasonably believe that disproportionately low offers would be considered ""fair,"" only 8-12 percent of dictators make positive offers. Further, there is evidence that an increase in stakes leads to a less than proportionate increase in monies transferred. Finally, examining the comparative static results from these allocation decisions, we find that recent theoretical models do a respectable job of explaining the data patterns. © 2006.","List, J.A.; Cherry, T.L.",J.

(The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2016-42182-001[/rid]). Objective: Theories about how couples help each other to cope with stress, such as the systemic transactional model of dyadic coping, suggest that the cultural context in which couples live influences how their coping behavior affects their relationship satisfaction. In contrast to the theoretical assumptions, a recent meta-analysis provides evidence that neither culture, nor gender, influences the association between dyadic coping and relationship satisfaction, at least based on their samples of couples living in North America and West Europe. Thus, it is an open questions whether the theoretical assumptions of cultural influences are false or whether cultural influences on couple behavior just occur in cultures outside of the Western world. Method: In order to examine the cultural influence, using a sample of married individuals (N = 7973) from 35 nations, we used multilevel modeling to test whether the positive association between dyadic coping and relationship satisfaction varies across nations and whether gender might moderate the association. Results: Results reveal that the association between dyadic coping and relationship satisfaction varies between nations. In addition, results show that in some nations the association is higher for men and in other nations it is higher for women. Conclusions: Cultural and gender differences across the globe influence how couples’ coping behavior affects relationship outcomes. This crucial finding indicates that couple relationship education programs and interventions need to be culturally adapted, as skill trainings such as dyadic coping lead to differential effects on relationship satisfaction based on the culture in which couples live.

School-track environment or endowment: What determines different other-regarding behavior across peer groups?,"Using data from dictator (DG) and public goods (PGG) game experiments run in classrooms with German pupils (ages 10-16) we analyze the differences in other-regarding behavior across two distinct school tracks which are entered at age 10. We find that pupils in the academic track give more and choose the equal split more often than pupils in the vocational track in the DG, but there are no robust track differences in the PGG. Selection into tracks results in differences in IQ, in personality and in socio-economic background, but these differences appear insufficient to account for the DG differences. A propensity-score-matching econometric model, based on a rich set of individual characteristics, provides evidence that the DG behavior of pupils with similar endowments is directly affected by the distinct track environments. We conclude that the existence of a treatment effect of tracks on other-regarding behavior in the DG of pupils is likely. © 2015 Elsevier Inc..","John, K.; Thomsen, S.L.",Games Econ. Behav.,1824
Altruistic Exploitation: Orphan Tourism and Global Social Work,"Despite the abundant scientific evidence demonstrating the benefits of family-based care for children and the damages brought on by institution-based care, the social work profession continues to endorse and engage in practices that promote the latter. This is particularly true through orphan tourism and orphan volunteerism- short- and longer-term forms of providing aid to residential facilities caring for children. Using educational tours to orphanages, fundraising and service projects, and academic internships based in such facilities, the profession contributes to the perpetuation of institution-based care and forms of exploitation. Based on an exhaustive review of the global literature and utilising an innovative theoretical framework of 'altruistic exploitation', the authors explore the ironic juxtaposition of benefits and harms associated with orphan tourism to the various stakeholders. Volunteers are often exploited in fulfilling their altruistic motives while at the same time engaging in potential exploitation of the very children they aim to serve. Authors further examine social work implications in the policy, practice and research arenas, and provide examples and recommendations in preventing family separation, promoting family-based alternative care and empowering communities. © 2017 The Author.","Rotabi, K S; Roby, J L; McCreery Bunkers, K",Br.

Matched fundraising: Evidence from a natural field experiment,"We present evidence from a natural field experiment designed to shed light on the efficacy of fundraising schemes in which donations are matched by a lead donor. In conjunction with the Bavarian State Opera House, we mailed 14,000 regular opera attendees a letter describing a charitable fundraising project organized by the opera house. Recipients were randomly assigned to treatments designed to explore behavioral responses to linear matching schemes, as well as the mere existence of a substantial lead donor. We use the exogenous variation in match rates across treatments to estimate the price elasticities of charitable giving. We find that straight linear matching schemes raise the total donations received including the match value, but partially crowd out the actual donations given excluding the match. If charitable organizations can use lead gifts as they wish, our results show that they maximize donations given by simply announcing the presence of a lead gift. We contrast our price elasticity estimates with those based on changes in rules regarding tax deductions for charitable giving, as well as from the nascent literature using large-scale natural field experiments on giving. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","Huck, S.; Rasul, I.",J.

The effect of requesting money with a few coins in one hand: the foot-in-the-hand technique,"Research has shown that individuals comply more readily to a monetary request made by a solicitor if the request disrupts the refusal script or if it is perceived as a legitimate request. We tested the effect of a new technique called the foot-in-the-hand technique (FITH), whereby solicitors requested money while holding a few coins in their hand. Findings show that the presence of money increased compliance with the request (Study 1), particularly when a reason for solicitation was added (Study 2). When the requesters stated that they were close to reaching the sum necessary to buy a particular product, more compliance was obtained (Study 3). A goal-oriented explanation was used to interpret the effect of the FITH technique. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","Guéguen, N.",Soc. Influ.,1829
Being inconsistent and compliant: The moderating role of the preference for consistency in the door-in-the-face technique,"Preference for consistency (PFC) refers to individual differences in the desire to be congruent, to be perceived as such, and the preference for others to be consistent. There are studies that show PFC as a moderator of consistency-based social influence strategies. The present article proposes PFC as a moderator of the social influence technique known as “door-in-the-face” (DITF), and suggests that DITF effectiveness also depends on consistency processes. The results of our study (N = 191) indicate that although the DITF effect was generally strong, the technique was most effective when PFC was low. These results are in line with theoretical assumptions that posit a preference for consistency. Low PFC individuals prefer change and unpredictability, and therefore tend to display inconsistent behavior. As a consequence, their refusal of an initial request leads to a higher probability that they will consent to the target one. These results are the first to show individual differences in DITF and reliance on (in)consistency in the effectiveness of the technique. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Cantarero, K.; Gamian-Wilk, M.; Dolinski, D.",Pers.

Is crowding out due entirely to fundraising? Evidence from a panel of charities,"When the government gives a gr ant to a private charitable organization, do the donors to that organization give less? If they do, is it because the grants crowd out donors who feel they gave through taxes (classic crowd out), or is it because the grant crowds out the fundraising of the charities who, after getting the grant, reduce efforts of fundraising (fundraising crowd-out)? This is the first paper to separate these two effects. Using a panel of more than 8000 charities, we find that crowding out is significant, at about 75%. We find this crowding out is due primarily to reduced fundraising. Depending on which types of organizations are included in the analysis, crowding out attributable to classic crowd-out ranges from 30% to a slight crowd-in effect, while fundraising crowd-out ranges from 70% to over 100% of all crowd-out. Such a finding could have important consequences for how governments structure grants to non-profits. Our results indicate, for example, that requirements that charities match a fraction of government grants with increases in private donations might be a feasible policy that could reduce the detrimental effects of crowding out. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","Andreoni, J.; Payne, A.A.",J.

Positive attitudes and negative expectations in lonely individuals,"Loneliness is a central predictor of depression and major factor of all-cause mortality. Loneliness is supposed to be a warning signal prompting individuals to seek out social connections. However, lonely individuals seem to be less likely to engage in prosocial activities and are overall more socially withdrawn. Hence, it is yet unclear whether and how loneliness affects an individual’s social motivations. Prosocial attitudes and expectations about social interactions of lonely individuals might shed light on whether lonely individuals are more prone to connect or withdraw from social activities. Here, results from a large dataset (~ 15,500 individuals) provide evidence for both. In particular, lonely individuals indicate stronger altruistic attitudes, suggesting a positive tendency to build and maintain social bonds. However, they also report more negative expectations about others, as they believe their social partners be less fair and trustworthy, suggesting less favorable evaluations of social interactions. By highlighting an important link between loneliness, prosocial attitudes and social expectations, this work stresses the role of loneliness in social motivations, points to potential consequences for social behaviors, and proposes a mechanism for the paradoxical effects of loneliness on an individual’s social attitudes and expectations, with important implications for future basic and clinical research, as well as education, economics and public policy. © 2020, The Author(s).","Bellucci, G.",Sci.

Here we bring together this interdisciplinary body of research and review the main theories that have been proposed to explain human prosociality, with an emphasis on kinship, reciprocity, indirect reciprocity, punishment, and morality. We highlight recent methodological advances that are stimulating research and point to some areas that either remain controversial or merit more attention. © 2015 by Annual Reviews.

A meta-analysis and systematic review evaluating the use of erythropoietin in total hip and knee arthroplasty,"Purpose: The debate is still ongoing on the effectiveness and safety of erythropoietin (EPO) treatment in orthopedic surgeries. Specifically, previous studies have not compared the dynamic change of hemoglobin (Hb) levels between different transfusion methods. Besides, complications or side effects of this alternative have not been quantitatively analyzed. We conducted a meta-analysis and systemic review to evaluate the efficacy of EPO on Hb levels observed during the whole perioperative period as well as the volume of allogeneic blood transfusion (ABT), the risk of venous thromboembolism, and application frequency of ABT in hip and knee surgery. Materials and methods: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane library were systematically searched from inception to November 2017. The data from randomized controlled trials were extracted and the risk of bias assessed using Cochrane's Collaboration's tool. Results: Twenty-five randomized controlled trials involving 4,159 patients were included in this meta-analysis. EPO could reduce exposure to allogeneic blood transfused (odds ratio [OR] =0.42, P=0.001) and reduce the average volume of allogeneic blood transfused (OR = -0.28, P=0.002). When EPO and preoperative autologous blood donation (PABD) were compared, the use of EPO was associated with lower exposure to ABT (OR =0.48, P=0.03), but no significant decrease in the average volume of allogeneic blood transfused (OR = -0.23, P=0.32). The use of EPO was associated with a higher level of Hb with or without use of PABD at all the 4 time points (preoperation, 24-48 hours postoperation, 3-5 days postoperation, discharge of last observation) (P<0.0001), which means EPO could increase the level of Hb significantly during the perioperative period. The results also indicated EPO does not increase the risk of a venous thromboembolism event. Conclusion: Preoperative administration of EPO was shown to generally increase Hb levels during the whole perioperative period; however, the extent of the positive effects varies with time points. Additionally, EPO minimizes the need for transfusion significantly in patients undergoing hip or knee surgery without increasing the chance of developing thrombotic complications. Therefore, EPO offers an alternative blood management strategy in total hip arthroplasty and total knee arthroplasty.","Li, Yi; Yin, Pengbin; Lv, Houchen; Meng, Yutong; Zhang, Licheng; Tang, Peifu",Ther.

The Role of Self-identity in the Theory of Planned Behavior: A Meta-Analysis: SELF-IDENTITY META-ANALYSIS,"The present study used meta-analysis to evaluate the role of self-identity in the theory of planned behavior (TPB). Altogether, 40 independent tests (N?=?11607) could be included in the review. A large, sample-weighted average correlation between self-identity and behavioral intention was observed (r+?=?.47). Multiple regression analyses showed that self-identity explained an increment of 6% of the variance in intention after controlling for the TPB components, and explained an increment of 9% of the variance when past behavior and the TPB components were controlled. The influence of self-identity on behavior was largely mediated by the strength of behavioral intentions. Theoretical implications of the findings are discussed.","Rise, Jostein; Sheeran, Paschal; Hukkelberg, Silje",J. Appl. Soc. Psychol.,1841
The effects of being watched on resource acquisition in chimpanzees and human children,"Animals react in many different ways to being watched by others. In the context of cooperation, many theories emphasize reputational effects: Individuals should cooperate more if other potential cooperators are watching. In the context of competition, individuals might want to show off their strength and prowess if other potential competitors are watching. In the current study, we observed chimpanzees and human children in three experimental conditions involving resource acquisition: Participants were either in the presence of a passive observer (observed condition), an active observer who engaged in the same task as the participant (competition condition), or in the presence of but not directly observed by a conspecific (mere presence condition). While both species worked to acquire more resources in the competition condition, children but not chimpanzees also worked to acquire more resources in the observer condition (compared to the mere presence condition). These results suggest evolutionary continuity with regard to competition-based observer effects, but an additional observer effect in young children, potentially arising from an evolutionary-based concern for cooperative reputation. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Engelmann, J.M.; Herrmann, E.; Tomasello, M.",Anim.

A comparison of the performance of for-profit and nonprofit U.S. psychiatric inpatient care providers since 1980,"OBJECTIVE: The authors synthesized evidence from a systematic review of the literature reporting substantiated performance differences between private for-profit and private nonprofit psychiatric inpatient care providers in the United States since 1980. They also compared reported differences in performance between nonprofit and for-profit inpatient psychiatric care providers with reported differences between nonprofit and for-profit providers of other types of health care. METHODS: Studies were located by means of computerized bibliographic searches and follow-up searches of studies cited in the articles located in the computerized search. The analysis included peer-reviewed studies that compared the performance of for-profit and nonprofit health service providers, including inpatient psychiatric services, in the areas of access, quality, cost-efficiency, and amount of charity care on the basis of quantitative data collected after 1980. The studies were classified in one of three categories according to the study conclusion: for-profit superiority, nonprofit superiority, or no difference or mixed results. RESULTS: Almost all studies (with one exception) found that the nonprofit psychiatric providers performed as well as or better than their for-profit counterparts. The proportion of studies reporting performance superiority of nonprofit versus for-profit psychiatric inpatient providers was greater than the proportion of studies reporting the same conclusion for providers of all other types of health care taken together. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of data collected since 1980, nonprofit psychiatric inpatient care providers in the United States had superior performance on access, quality, cost-efficiency, and amount of charity care, compared with for-profit providers. Caution is warranted in pursuing public policies that permit or encourage the replacement of nonprofit psychiatric inpatient care providers with for-profit providers of these services.","Rosenau, Pauline Vaillancourt; Linder, Stephen H",Psychiatr.

High or low oxygen saturation and severe retinopathy of prematurity: a meta-analysis,"Among pre-term infants with a gestational age of 32 weeks or less, early low oxygen and late high oxygen saturation were associated with a reduced risk for severe retinopathy of prematurity compared with low oxygen alone, but further research is needed. XCM: Inclusion criteria for the review were clearly defined. Two relevant databases were searched. There was the risk of language bias as only English language articles were included. Publication bias was assessed and was not detected. Attempts were made to reduce reviewer error and bias during data extraction, but it was not clear if such attempts were used for study selection.Trial quality assessment was not reported, so the quality of the included studies was unknown. Trials were pooled using meta-analysis, but statistical heterogeneity was not always reported. A stratification analysis was undertaken, which indicated differences between studies, notably trials and observational studies. The authors acknowledged the lack of data reported in individual studies, and the high level of heterogeneity (which may indicate that pooling of studies was not appropriate).Overall, the potential for biases within the review, together with the uncertain quality and heterogeneity of the included studies, limit the reliability of the author’s conclusions. XIM: Practice: The authors did not state any implications for practice. Research: The authors stated that a sufficiently powered RCT on optimal oxygen delivery in the early and late stages of retinopathy of prematurity that also ensures long-term visual, pulmonary, and neurodevelopment follow-up is needed. Trials should adopt the postmenstrual age concept.","Chen, M L; Guo, L; Smith, L E; Dammann, C E; Dammann, O",,1846

The co-evolution of honesty and strategic vigilance,"We hypothesize that when honesty is not motivated by selfish goals, it reveals social preferences that have evolved for convincing strategically vigilant partners that one is a person worth cooperating with. In particular, we explain how the patterns of dishonest behavior observed in recent experiments can be motivated by preferences for social and self-esteem. These preferences have evolved because they are adaptive in an environment where it is advantageous to be selected as a partner by others and where these others are strategically vigilant: they efficiently evaluate the expected benefit of cooperating with specific partners and attend to their intentions. We specify the adaptive value of strategic vigilance and preferences for social and self-esteem. We argue that evolved preferences for social and self-esteem are satisfied by applying mechanisms of strategic vigilance to one's own behavior. We further argue that such cognitive processes obviate the need for the evolution of preferences for fairness and social norm compliance. © 2016 Heintz, Karabegovic and Molnar.","Heintz, C.; Karabegovic, M.; Molnar, A.",Front.

"Normative explanations of helping behavior: A critique, proposal, and empirical test","Criticisms of normative explanations of helping behavior are examined, and an explanation responsive to these criticisms is proposed. This explanation specifies conditions which affect the activation of personal norms and hence their influence on behavior. One hypothesis based on the explanation was tested: the impact of norms on behavior is a function of the tendency to deny or to ascribe responsibility to the self (AR). AR and personal norms toward donating bone marrow to a stranger were measured in a mailed questionnaire. Three months later, 132 women received mailed appeals to join a pool of potential donors from an unrelated source. As predicted, volunteering was a function of the AR × personal norm interaction (p < .0001). Personal norms had no impact on volunteering among those low on AR (deniers), but a substantial impact among those high on AR. Neither intentions to donate, attitudes toward transplants, nor various sociodemographic variables added to the variance in volunteering accounted for by the AR × personal norm interaction. © 1973.","Schwartz, S.H.",J.

Philanthropy in transition,"The already vibrant charitable sector in the US is in the midst of a transformation that is altering both the manner in which donations occur and the causes that are supported. Philanthropy in Transition examines the unique role that charitable giving has played in the US, from colonial times to the present. The rising importance of new means of contributing, particularly giving through buying or investing, is considered. These new models of philanthropy have expanded the ways by which ethical consumers or investors can support a cause. Although these innovations represent a revolution in the structure of philanthropy, they introduce significant complexity to the act of giving - donors are far removed from recipients – and this may weaken the impact of contributing. This transformation is also likely to accelerate the rising importance of web-based promotion and fund-raising, as traditional nonprofits compete with social market enterprises and social impact investments for funds. © Mark S.

Responsibility and dependency,"In 2 experiments the Ss were ""workers"" operating under the supposed guidance of their peer (a stranger) who was playing the part of their ""supervisor."" The men in the High Dependency condition were informed that E's evaluation of the supervisor would depend largely upon their productivity, while the Low Dependency Ss were told that this evaluation would not be affected by their performance. There was a significantly greater performance in the High Dependency condition. In general, the Low Dependency Ss worked harder when told that the supervisor would soon learn of their performance than when they had been informed that he would not find out about their productivity until much later. The immediacy with which the supervisor would learn of S's productivity did not affect performance under high dependency, however. The Ss in this condition worked relatively hard presumably because of a feeling of responsibility to the dependent peer.

Some causes are more equal than others? The effect of similarity on substitution in charitable giving,"Donation matching and other directed interventions to encourage prosocial contributions may affect contributions through other channels. In an experimental dictator game where subjects may donate to two different real-world charities, we simulate activity-specific interventions by varying the relative productivity of those charities, and introduce several treatments to test whether (i) subjects substitute across charities, and (ii) whether substitution occurs even across (possibly very) dissimilar alternatives. We find that significant substitution occurs in all cases, but that the effect is weaker the more dissimilar the charity alternatives. In our most dissimilar treatment, substitution is only half as large as when alternatives are very similar. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Ek, C.",J. Econ. Behav. Organ.,1856
"A systematic review of barriers and facilitators to minority research participation among African Americans, Latinos, Asian Americans, and Pacific Islanders","To assess the experienced or perceived barriers and facilitators to health research participation for major US racial/ethnic minority populations, we conducted a systematic review of qualitative and quantitative studies from a search on PubMed and Web of Science from January 2000 to December 2011. With 44 articles included in the review, we found distinct and shared barriers and facilitators. Despite different expressions of mistrust, all groups represented in these studies were willing to participate for altruistic reasons embedded in cultural and community priorities. Greater comparative understanding of barriers and facilitators to racial/ethnic minorities' research participation can improve population-specific recruitment and retention strategies and could better inform future large-scale prospective quantitative and in-depth ethnographic studies.","George, Sheba; Duran, Nelida; Norris, Keith",Am.

Investor's Pessimistic and False Belief About Trustworthiness and Stake Size in Trust Decision,"Trust is a vital element of any society. Previous studies using trust games have provided insight into understandings of trusting behavior. However, investors' behaviors can be confounded by their risk preferences in the game, and little is known about the relationship between stake size and beliefs of others' good intentions underlying trust. We thus used a variant of the trust game and conducted two experiments to examine how stake size affects investors' beliefs about receivers' trustworthiness, with model-based analyses. We showed that, when holding all else equal, investors trusted more, but their expectations of reciprocation declined as stake size increased. However, actual receivers' reciprocation rates showed the opposite trend to investors' pessimistic beliefs. Furthermore, following previous studies in social psychology, we hypothesized that investors' social preferences (social value orientation) moderated the beliefs underlying trust, but they had no explanatory powers in investors' expectations of reciprocation. These results suggest that peoples' naive beliefs about stake size play a more important role in trust decisions than expected. © 2020 Japanese Psychological Association.

Moral and religious convictions: Are they the same or different things?,"People often assume that moral and religious convictions are functionally the same thing. But are they? We report on 19 studies (N = 12,284) that tested whether people's perceptions that their attitudes are reflections of their moral and religious convictions across 30 different issues were functionally the same (the equivalence hypothesis) or different constructs (the distinct constructs hypothesis), and whether the relationship between these constructs was conditional on political orientation (the political asymmetry hypothesis). Seven of these studies (N = 5,561, and 22 issues) also had data that allowed us to test whether moral and religious conviction are only closely related for those who are more rather than less religious (the secularization hypothesis), and a narrower form of the political asymmetry and secularization hypotheses, that is, that people's moral and religious convictions may be tightly connected constructs only for religious conservatives. Meta-analytic tests of each of these hypotheses yielded weak support for the secularization hypothesis, no support for the equivalence or political asymmetry hypotheses, and the strongest support for the distinct constructs hypothesis.","Skitka, Linda J; Hanson, Brittany E; Washburn, Anthony N; Mueller, Allison B",PLoS One,1860

Intuitive decision-making promotes rewarding prosocial others independent of the personality trait Honesty-Humility,"Although past research has convincingly shown that rewarding prosocial individuals helps to establish high levels of cooperation, research investigating factors that promote rewarding others has been surprisingly rare. The present research addresses this gap and examines two factors that were shown in past research to play a role in prosocial behaviour. In a well-powered study (total N = 1003), we tested the impact of (a) a basic prosocial personality trait (the Honesty-Humility dimension from the HEXACO personality model) and (b) intuitive decision-making, as well as (c) their interaction, in rewarding prosocial individuals. We found that (1) intuition promotes rewarding prosocial others; (2) Honesty-Humility was not significantly related to rewarding prosocial others; and (3) that Honesty-Humility did not significantly moderate the effect of intuition on reward. Implications for the understanding of reciprocating others’ prosocial behaviour are discussed. © 2020, The Author(s).","Nockur, L.; Pfattheicher, S.",Sci. Rep.,1862

These findings indicate the importance of affect, although they allow that reasoning can play a restricted but significant role in moral judgment. They also point towards a preliminary account of the functional neuroanatomy of moral judgment, according to which many brain areas make important contributions to moral judgment although none is devoted specifically to it.","Greene, J.; Haidt, J.",Trends Cogn.

According to system justification theory, however, some ideologies — such as those that are conservative, religious, and legitimizing of the status quo — are especially appealing to people whose epistemic, existential, and relational motives are chronically or temporarily heightened. In this article, we focus on relational motivation, describing evidence that conservatives are more likely than liberals to: prioritize values of conformity and tradition; possess a strong desire to share reality with like-minded others; perceive within-group consensus when making political and non-political judgments; be influenced by implicit relational cues and sources who are perceived as similar to them; and maintain homogenous social networks and favor an ‘echo chamber’ environment that is conducive to the spread of misinformation. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Jost, J.T.; van der Linden, S.; Panagopoulos, C.; Hardin, C.D.",Curr.

Weight management using a meal replacement strategy: meta and pooling analysis from six studies,"PMR weight management plans can safely and effectively produce significant sustainable weight loss and improve weight-related risk factors for disease. XCM: The review question was clear in terms of the study designs, participants, interventions and outcomes of interest. The authors searched three relevant electronic databases. However, no attempts were made to identify unpublished studies and the authors did not state whether any language restrictions were applied; therefore, the possibility of publication and language biases cannot be excluded. Publication bias was assessed for statistical significance, which the authors stated was not supported, except in the assessment of weight loss at one year. A flow chart representing the study selection process was presented, but this suggested that no RCTs were included in the meta-analysis, which is contradictory to their results. The authors did not report details of the review process pertaining to the study selection, quality assessment and data extraction processes; the potential for reviewer error or bias cannot, therefore, be assessed. The studies were assessed for quality using an appropriate, validated, quality assessment tool. Adequate details of the included studies were reported. Heterogeneity was assessed and was found to be statistically significant. However, the studies were still pooled using both summary data and IPD.

Surveillance cues enhance moral condemnation,"Humans pay close attention to the reputational consequences of their actions. Recent experiments indicate that even very subtle cues that one is being observed can affect cooperative behaviors. Expressing our opinions about the morality of certain acts is a key means of advertising our cooperative dispositions. Here, we investigated how subtle cues of being watched would affect moral judgments. We predicted that participants exposed to such cues would affirm their endorsement of prevailing moral norms by expressing greater disapproval of moral transgressions. Participants read brief accounts of two moral violations and rated the moral acceptability of each violation. Violations were more strongly condemned in a condition where participants were exposed to surveillance cues (an image of eyes interposed between the description of the violation and the associated rating scale) than in a control condition (in which the interposed image was of flowers). We discuss the role that public declarations play in the interpersonal evaluation of cooperative dispositions.","Bourrat, P.; Baumard, N.; McKay, R.",Evol. Psychol.,1869
Are dictators averse to inequality?,"We present the results of an experiment designed to identify more clearly the motivation underlying dictators' behavior. In the typical dictator game, recipients are given no endowment. We give an endowment to the recipient as well as the dictator. This new dimension allows us to test directly for inequality aversion. Our results confirm that the inequality between dictator's and recipient's endowment is a key determinant of the dictator's giving. As we increase the recipient's endowment from 0 to an amount equal to the dictator's endowment, the mean amount passed drops from 30 percent to less than 12 percent of the dictator's endowment, and the proportion of dictators who pass positive amounts falls from 75 percent to 26 percent. Thus the majority of dictators exhibit behavior consistent with inequality averse preferences. On the other hand, only 24 percent of dictators split payoffs equally suggesting that maximin preferences are less important drivers of dictators' giving. © 2012 Elsevier B.V..","Korenok, O.; Millner, E.L.; Razzolini, L.",J.

Altruism Reconsidered: The Effect of Denying Feedback on a Victim's Status to Empathic Witnesses,"The empathy-altruism hypothesis interprets the empathy-helping link as evidence of true altruism. The negative state relief model interprets the same relation as an artifact of egoistic sadness-reduction. Neither view expresses the possibility that empathic concern reflects a general sensitivity to the emotional state of the victim and a specific sensitivity to vicarious joy at the resolution of the victim's needs. It is proposed that the prospect of empathic joy, conveyed by feedback from the help recipient, is essential to the special tendency of empathic witnesses to help. In neither of the alternative models does goal attainment depend on feedback. Results of an experimental contrast were consistent with the empathic joy hypothesis and inconsistent with the alternatives. Empathically aroused witnesses offered help reliably to a person in distress only when they expected feedback on the result; when denied feedback, empathic witnesses were no more likely to help than their nonempathic counter-parts. In contrast, nonempathic witnesses were unaffected by the availability of feedback in deciding whether to help. Implications of an empathic joy-based motive are discussed.","Smith, K.D.; Keating, J.P.; Stotland, E.",J. Pers. Soc. Psychol.,1871

Differential pattern of functional brain plasticity after compassion and empathy training,"Although empathy is crucial for successful social interactions, excessive sharing of others' negative emotions may be maladaptive and constitute a source of burnout. To investigate functional neural plasticity underlying the augmentation of empathy and to test the counteracting potential of compassion, one group of participants was first trained in empathic resonance and subsequently in compassion. In response to videos depicting human suffering, empathy training, but not memory training (control group), increased negative affect and brain activations in anterior insula and anterior midcingulate cortex-brain regions previously associated with empathy for pain. In contrast, subsequent compassion training could reverse the increase in negative effect and, in contrast, augment self-reports of positive affect. In addition, compassion training increased activations in a nonoverlapping brain network spanning ventral striatum, pregenual anterior cingulate cortex and medial orbitofrontal cortex. We conclude that training compassion may reflect a new coping strategy to overcome empathic distress and strengthen resilience. © The Author (2013).

In addition, this study demonstrates, through meta-regression, that nonprofit subsector variation, organizational age as a control, longitudinal data structure, and endogeneity correction help explain the effect size heterogeneity within and across original studies.

"Do Angry Birds Make for Angry Children? A Meta-Analysis of Video Game Influences on Children’s and Adolescents’ Aggression, Mental Health, Prosocial Behavior, and Academic Performance","The issue of whether video games—violent or nonviolent—“harm” children and adolescents continues to be hotly contested in the scientific community, among politicians, and in the general public. To date, researchers have focused on college student samples in most studies on video games, often with poorly standardized outcome measures. To answer questions about harm to minors, these studies are arguably not very illuminating. In the current analysis, I sought to address this gap by focusing on studies of video game influences on child and adolescent samples. The effects of overall video game use and exposure to violent video games specifically were considered, although this was not an analysis of pathological game use. Overall, results from 101 studies suggest that video game influences on increased aggression (r =.06), reduced prosocial behavior (r =.04), reduced academic performance (r = −.01), depressive symptoms (r =.04), and attention deficit symptoms (r =.03) are minimal. Issues related to researchers’ degrees of freedom and citation bias also continue to be common problems for the field. Publication bias remains a problem for studies of aggression. Recommendations are given on how research may be improved and how the psychological community should address video games from a public health perspective. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","Ferguson, C.J.",Perspect.

On seeing and being seen,"The paper addresses John Roemer’s recent work on Kantian optimization and Kantian equilibria. Roemer argues that the standard economic theory of Nash equilibria is incapable of accounting for cooperative behavior such as recycling, reporting one’s income honestly, and voting in national elections. Instead we should assume that a cooperator is motivated to do what would most benefit her if all did the same. In commenting on this proposal, the first section of the paper summarizes Kant’s original formulation of the categorical imperative and relates it to psychological and historical studies of magical thinking. The next section distinguishes between unconditional and conditional norms of behavior and, within the latter, between the social norms of cooperation that can be triggered when what the agent does is being observed by others and the quasi-moral norms of cooperation that can be triggered when an agent observes what others do. To illustrate these ideas, the paper cites many experiments and historical case studies, the most important being the non-consumption, non-importation, and non-exportation movements in the American revolution. The concluding section summarizes Roemer’s own empirical work, and discusses critically his argument that his findings can be explained by assuming that agents are conditional Kantians. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Elster, J.",Soc.

How Much Is Our Fairness Worth? The Effect of Raising Stakes on Offers by Proposers and Minimum Acceptable Offers in Dictator and Ultimatum Games,"Background: The aim of this study was to determine whether people respond differently to low and high stakes in Dictator and Ultimatum Games. We assumed that if we raised the stakes high enough, we would observe more self-orientated behavior because fairness would become too costly, in spite of a possible risk of a higher punishment. Methods: A questionnaire was completed by a sample of 524 university students of biology. A mixed linear model was used to test the relation between the amount at stake (CZK 20, 200, 2,000, 20,000 and 200,000, i.e., approximately $1-$10,000) and the shares, as well as the subjects' gender and the design of the study (single vs. multiple games for different amounts). Results: We have discovered a significant relationship between the amount at stake and the minimum acceptable offer in the Ultimatum Game and the proposed shares in both Ultimatum and Dictator Games (p = 0.001, p<0.001, p = 0.0034). The difference between playing a single game or more games with several amounts at stake did not influence the relation between the stakes and the offered and minimum acceptable shares. Women proved significantly more generous than men in their offers in the Dictator Game (p = 0.007). Conclusion: Our results suggest that people's behavior in the Dictator and Ultimatum Games depends on the amount at stake. The players tended to lower their relative proposed shares, as well as their relative minimum acceptable offers. We propose that the Responders' sense of equity and fair play depends on the stakes because of the costs of maintaining fairness. However, our results also suggest that the price of fairness is very high and that it is very difficult, probably even impossible, to buy the transition of Homo sociologicus into Homo economicus. © 2013 Novakova, Flegr.","Novakova, J.; Flegr, J.",PLoS ONE,1881

Gender-biased expectations of altruism in adolescents,"Research suggests that women, but not men, manifest gender-biased expectations of altruism: while women expect other women to be more altruistic, men expect women to be as generous as men. Do adolescents expect women and men to behave differently regarding altruism? I analyse adolescents' gender beliefs about altruism using a modified Dictator Game. Results indicate that adolescents believe that others of same gender are more altruistic than others of the opposite gender. I also found that adolescents' agreement with the existence of different societal roles for men and women moderates the relationship between gender and gender beliefs. Although it was expected that adolescents who agree with different gender roles would expect women to be more generous, surprisingly, the results presented here confirm this only for male adolescents, but in the opposite direction: the more male adolescents agree with the existence of different gender roles, the more they seem to believe that men are more generous than women. Meanwhile, female adolescents believe that women are more altruistic unconditionally. Thus, the previously documented bias seems to be already in place during adolescence, above and beyond other confounding factors. Adolescents' in-group bias, and their socialization into different cultural values regarding gender roles are discussed as potential explanatory mechanisms for these gender beliefs. © 2018 Salgado.","Salgado, M.",Front.

The Chicago Fire of 1871: A bottom-up approach to disaster relief,"Can bottom-up relief efforts lead to recovery after disasters? Conventional wisdom and contemporary public policy suggest that major crises require centralized authority to provide disaster relief goods. Using a novel set of comprehensive donation and expenditure data collected from archival records, this paper examines a bottom-up relief effort following one of the most devastating natural disasters of the nineteenth century: the Chicago Fire of 1871. Findings show that while there was no central government relief agency present, individuals, businesses, corporate entities and municipal governments were able to finance the relief effort though donations. The Chicago Relief and Aid Society, a voluntary association of agents with a stake in relief outcomes, leveraged organizational assets and constitutional rules to administer aid. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Skarbek, E.C.",Public Choice,1884

GnRH Agonist Trigger and LH Activity Luteal Phase Support versus hCG Trigger and Conventional Luteal Phase Support in Fresh Embryo Transfer IVF/ICSI Cycles-A Systematic PRISMA Review and Meta-analysis,"INTRODUCTION: The use of GnRH agonist (GnRHa) for final oocyte maturation trigger in oocyte donation and elective frozen embryo transfer cycles is well established due to lower ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) rates as compared to hCG trigger. A recent Cochrane meta-analysis concluded that GnRHa trigger was associated with reduced live birth rates (LBRs) in fresh autologous IVF cycles compared to hCG trigger. However, the evidence is not unequivocal, and recent trials have found encouraging reproductive outcomes among couples undergoing GnRHa trigger and individualized luteal LH activity support. Thus, the aim was to compare GnRHa trigger followed by luteal LH activity support with hCG trigger in IVF patients undergoing fresh embryo transfer. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials published until December 14, 2016. The population was infertile patients submitted to IVF/ICSI cycles with GnRH antagonist cotreatment who underwent fresh embryo transfer. The intervention was GnRHa trigger followed by LH activity luteal phase support (LPS). The comparator was hCG trigger followed by a standard LPS. The critical outcome measures were LBR and OHSS rate. The secondary outcome measures were number of oocytes retrieved, clinical and ongoing pregnancy rates, and miscarriage rates. RESULTS: A total of five studies met the selection criteria comprising a total of 859 patients. The LBR was not significantly different between the GnRHa and hCG trigger groups (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.62, 1.14). OHSS was reported in a total of 4/413 cases in the GnRHa group compared to 7/413 in the hCG group (OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.15, 1.60). We observed a slight, but non-significant increase in miscarriage rate in the GnRHa triggered group compared to the hCG group (OR 1.85; 95% CI 0.97, 3.54). CONCLUSION: GnRHa trigger with LH activity LPS resulted in comparable LBRs compared to hCG trigger. The most recent trials reported LBRs close to unity indicating that individualization of the LH activity LPS improved the luteal phase deficiency reported in the first GnRHa trigger studies. However, LPS optimization is needed to further limit OHSS in the subgroup of normoresponder patients (<14 follicles ≥ 11 mm).

Do tax incentives affect charitable contributions? Evidence from public charities' reported revenues,"This paper estimates the effect of the charitable contribution tax deduction on charities' donation revenue from charities' tax filings. A one percent increase in the tax cost of giving causes charitable receipts to fall by about four percent, an effect three times larger the consensus in the literature. Further analysis reveals substantial heterogeneity in the tax response by subsector: health care and home care are more tax-sensitive than other charities, while higher education and arts are less tax-sensitive. The results are consistent with substantial tax response heterogeneity within the sample and between sampled and unsampled charities, implying that the mean tax elasticity of charitable contributions is a poor predictor of tax incentive effects for individual charities. © 2016 Elsevier B.V..","Duquette, N.J.",J.

Market Orientations in the Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector: A Meta-Analysis of Their Relationships With Organizational Performance,"In their effort to improve performance, many voluntary and nonorofit organizations (VNPOs) have turned to market mechanisms, hoping to learn and implement innovative ideas and methods that proved useful in the private sector. This article adopts the businesslike concept of ?marketing? into the arena of VNPOs by offering a meta-analysis to assess the marketing orientation (MO) in the VNPO sector. The article attempts to answer three questions: (a) What is the theoretical grounding and rationality for using MO strategies in the VNPO sector? (b) Can the VNPO sector benefit from an MO approach? (c) Is the MO perspective applicable for organizations without ?profit? as a main goal? The findings were compared with findings in the for-profit sector and were found to be stronger. Finally, using a second, methodological meta-analysis, boundary conditions on the MO-performance link were assessed. The implications for VNPOs are discussed and directions for future research are outlined.","Shoham, Aviv; Ruvio, Ayalla; Vigoda-Gadot, Eran; Schwabsky, Nitza",Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Quarterly,1891
The Effect of Matching Contribution Offers and Legitimization of Paltry Contributions On Compliance,"The use of a matching contribution offer in conjunction with legitimization of paltry contributions is examined in a door‐to‐door charitable solicitation context. Three hundred and twenty households were exposed to charitable contribution requests employing either legitimization of paltry contributions, a matching contribution offer, both, or a control. It was predicted that the matching funds offer, paired with legitimization of paltry donations, would increase both compliance rates and donation sizes and generate greater revenues than either tactic used singly. The results of a field experiment support this prediction. Copyright © 1989, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved","Fraser, C.; Hite, R.E.",J. Appl. Soc. Psychol.,1892
Thou shalt not steal: Taking aversion with legal property claims,"Do people have an innate respect for property? In the literature, there is controversy about whether human subjects are taking averse. We implemented a dictator game with a symmetric action space to address potential misconceptions and framing and demand effects that may be responsible for the contradictory findings. Misconceptions can occur as a result of unclear property rights, while framing and demand effects can occur if anonymity is not preserved. Our paper is the first to implement both a strict double-blind anonymity protocol and clear property rights. We established clear property claims by asking subjects in our legal treatment to bring their own property to the experiment. In the effort treatment, the experimenter transferred the property publicly to subjects after they completed a real effort task. Our data suggest that without social enforcement, respect for property is low. Yet, the taking rate significantly differs from the theoretically predicted maximum. Consistent with the Lockean theory of property, respect for property grows when the entitlement is legitimized by the labor the owner had to invest to acquire it. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Faillo, M.; Rizzolli, M.; Tontrup, S.",J.

"A Polyhedron Model of Wisdom: A Systematic Review of the Wisdom Studies in Psychology, Management and Leadership, and Education","No consensus on a definition of wisdom exists. Hence, 50 articles were systematically reviewed from the fields of psychology, management and leadership, and education to examine points of consensus among conceptions of wisdom. These articles were limited to the most cited peer-reviewed articles published between 2006 and 2018 that include wisdom in the title and key words. Based on the review, the Polyhedron Model of Wisdom was developed with components that characterize wisdom including knowledge management, self-regulation, altruism and moral maturity, openness and tolerance, sound judgment and decision making, intelligence and creative thinking, and dynamic balance and synthesis translated into action. This study is a step toward defining wisdom components upon which strategies to foster wisdom could be built. In the future, researchers should investigate ways of fostering wisdom through enhancing components of wisdom. © 2020 The Roeper Institute.","Karami, S.; Ghahremani, M.; Parra-Martinez, F.A.; Gentry, M.",Roeper Rev.,1894

Is a donor in hand better than two in the bush? Evidence from a natural field experiment,"This study examines why people initially give to charities, why they remain committed to the cause, and what factors attenuate these influences. Using an experimental design that links donations across distinct treatments separated in time, we present several results. For example, previous donors are more likely to give, and contribute more, than other donor types. Yet, how previous donors were acquired is critical: agents initially attracted by an economic mechanism are more likely to continue giving than agents attracted by a nonmechanism factor. From a methodological viewpoint, our study showcases the benefit of moving beyond an experimental design that focuses on short-run substitution effects.","Landry, C.E.; Lange, A.; List, J.A.; Price, M.K.; Rupp, N.G.",Am.

Reviewing existing knowledge prior to conducting animal studies,"Highly polarised viewpoints about animal experimentation have often prevented agreement. However, important common ground between advocates and opponents was demonstrated within a discussion forum hosted at www.research-methodology.org.uk in July-August 2008, by the independent charity, SABRE Research UK. Agreement existed that many animal studies have methodological flaws - such as inappropriate sample sizes, lack of randomised treatments, and unblinded outcome assessments - that may introduce bias and limit statistical validity. There was also agreement that systematic reviews of the human utility of animal models yield the highest quality of evidence, as their reliance on methodical and impartial methods to select significant numbers of animal studies for review, serves to minimise bias. Unfortunately, disagreement remained that animal experimental licence applications should reference systematic reviews of existing studies, before approval. The UK Medical Research Council requires that researchers planning human clinical trials must reference such reviews of related previous work. Existing knowledge is thereby fully and appropriately utilised, and redundant experimentation is avoided. However, objections were raised that a similar requirement would interfere with animal experimental licensing, because, to date, there have been very few systematic reviews of animal studies. In fact, the relative dearth of such reviews is a matter of considerable concern, and may partially explain the very poor human success rates of drugs that appear safe and/or efficacious in animal trials. Nevertheless, the disturbing number of human trials which have proceeded concurrently with, or prior to, animal studies, or have continued despite equivocal evidence of efficacy in animals, clearly demonstrate that many researchers fail to conduct adequate prior reviews of existing evidence. Where neither sufficient primary studies, nor systematic reviews of such studies, exist, for citation within a licence application, researchers should be able to provide evidence of this shortcoming, and, concurrently, demonstrate that the available literature and evidence have been adequately reviewed. This should also enable them to clearly demonstrate the need and scientific appropriateness of their proposed study, the validity of its design, and - importantly - that the benefits are reasonably likely to exceed the animal welfare, bioethical and financial costs. Invasive animal studies should never be permitted solely on the basis of less probable, speculative or intangible human benefits, or the mere satisfaction of scientific curiosity.","Knight, Andrew",Altern.

"More Is Better, But Fair Is Fair: Tipping in Dictator and Ultimatum Games","This paper examines Allocators' willingness to reward and punish their paired Recipients. Recipients only compete in a skill-testing contest, the outcome of which determines the size of the surplus. In the dictator game, Allocators reward skillful Recipients, but punish unskillful ones only modestly. The punishment effect is mitigated by the belief held by some Allocators thateffortis the appropriate measure of deservingness. The ultimatum game extension reveals offerers' ability to adapt to the strategic environment. Offers to skillful Recipients in the ultimatum game, however, are shown to be motivated by a taste for fairness, and not strategic considerations.Journal of Economic LiteratureClassification Numbers: C70, C91, D63. © 1998 Academic Press.","Ruffle, B.J.",Games Econ.

Subjects were randomly exposed to one of eight solicitation conditions where cause (highly prosocial, less prosocial) and social comparison (No C [confederate], C does not donate, C donated $1.00, C donated $10.00) were varied. The robustness of the LPF technique was assessed by examining the impact of the extent to which the cause was prosocial and by the magnitude of the pledge made by another on the probability of targets’ compliance as well as on the magnitude of the pledges.

"Key stakeholder perceptions about consent to participate in acute illness research: a rapid, systematic review to inform epi/pandemic research preparedness","BACKGROUND: A rigorous research response is required to inform clinical and public health decision-making during an epi/pandemic. However, the ethical conduct of such research, which often involves critically ill patients, may be complicated by the diminished capacity to consent and an imperative to initiate trial therapies within short time frames. Alternative approaches to taking prospective informed consent may therefore be used. We aimed to rapidly review evidence on key stakeholder (patients, their proxy decision-makers, clinicians and regulators) views concerning the acceptability of various approaches for obtaining consent relevant to pandemic-related acute illness research. METHODS: We conducted a rapid evidence review, using the Internet, database and hand-searching for English language empirical publications from 1996 to 2014 on stakeholder opinions of consent models (prospective informed, third-party, deferred, or waived) used in acute illness research. We excluded research on consent to treatment, screening, or other such procedures, non-emergency research and secondary studies. Papers were categorised, and data summarised using narrative synthesis. RESULTS: We screened 689 citations, reviewed 104 full-text articles and included 52. Just one paper related specifically to pandemic research. In other emergency research contexts potential research participants, clinicians and research staff found third-party, deferred, and waived consent to be acceptable as a means to feasibly conduct such research. Acceptability to potential participants was motivated by altruism, trust in the medical community, and perceived value in medical research and decreased as the perceived risks associated with participation increased. Discrepancies were observed in the acceptability of the concept and application or experience of alternative consent models. Patients accepted clinicians acting as proxy-decision makers, with preference for two decision makers as invasiveness of interventions increased. Research regulators were more cautious when approving studies conducted with alternative consent models; however, their views were generally under-represented. CONCLUSIONS: Third-party, deferred, and waived consent models are broadly acceptable to potential participants, clinicians and/or researchers for emergency research. Further consultation with key stakeholders, particularly with regulators, and studies focused specifically on epi/pandemic research, are required. We highlight gaps and recommendations to inform set-up and protocol development for pandemic research and institutional review board processes.

"Deliberation erodes cooperative behavior — Even towards competitive out-groups, even when using a control condition, and even when eliminating selection bias","By many accounts cooperation appears to be a default strategy in social interaction. There are, however, several documented instances in which reflexive responding favors aggressive behaviors: for example, interactions with out-group members. We conduct a rigorous test of potential boundary conditions of intuitive prosociality by looking at whether intuition favors cooperation even towards competitive out-group members, and even in losses frames. Moreover, we address three major methodological limitations of previous research in this area: a lack of an unconstrained control condition; non-compliance with time manipulations leading to high rates of exclusions and thus a selection bias; and non-comprehension of the structure of the game. Even after eliminating participant selection bias and non-comprehension, we find that deliberation decreases cooperation: even in competitive contexts towards out-groups and even in a losses frame, though the differences in cooperation between groups was consistent across conditions. People may be intuitive cooperators, but they are not intuitively impartial. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Everett, J.A.C.; Ingbretsen, Z.; Cushman, F.; Cikara, M.",J. Exp. Soc. Psychol.,1906
Decision-making about broad- and narrowcasting: a neuroscientific perspective,"What differentiates sharing with few, well-defined others (narrowcasting) from sharing with loosely defined crowds (broadcasting)? One possibility involves a trade-off where broadcasting is self-focused and self-serving, and narrowcasting is based on other-oriented, altruistic motives. We present neuroimaging data consistent with a second, parallel-processes perspective. According to this account, both narrow- and broadcasting simultaneously involve self-related and social motives since these concepts are strongly intertwined both on a psychological and neural level. We recorded brain activity within regions that are meta-analytically associated with self-related and social cognition while participants made decisions to narrow- or broadcast New York Times articles on social media. Results show increased involvement of brain regions associated with both self-related and social processing in narrow- and broadcasting, compared to a control condition. However, both processes were involved with higher intensity during narrowcasting, compared to broadcasting. These data help to disambiguate a theoretical discussion in communication science and clarify the neuropsychological mechanisms that drive sharing decisions in different contexts. Specifically, we highlight that narrow- and broadcasting afford differing intensities of two psychological processes that are crucial to persuasion and population-level content virality.

When saying no leads to compliance: The door-in-the-face technique for changing attitudes and behaviors towards smoking at work,"Introduction The aim of this action research was to encourage workers to comply with an anti-smoking charter and get them to effectively reduce their tobacco use. Two change procedures were compared: a classic one based on an information campaign and an original one based on the door-in-the-face technique. Method Forty-three smoking workers participated in this study. They were assigned to one of the two groups: information campaign group or door-in-the-face group. Two types of measures were administered. The first assessed self-reported attitudes towards smoking, such as perceived dependence (Fagerström Test); the second assessed effective behavior, such as number of cigarettes smoked and physiological nicotine addiction. Conclusion Taken together, the results show that the door-in-the-face technique was more effective than the information campaign. These results are discussed in light of the social acceptability of the initial refusal. © 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS.","Pansu, P.; Lima, L.; Fointiat, V.",Rev. Eur. Psychol. Appl.,1908

Type and amount of help as predictors for impression of helpers,"Impression of helpers can vary as a function of the magnitude of helping (amount of help) and of situational and motivational aspects (type of help). Over three studies conducted in Sweden and the US, we manipulated both the amount and the type of help in ten diverse vignettes and measured participants’ impressions of the described helpers. Impressions were almost unaffected when increasing the amount of help by 500%, but clearly affected by several type of help-manipulations. Particularly, helpers were less positively evaluated if they had mixed motives for helping, did not experience intense emotions or empathy, or if helping involved no personal sacrifice. In line with the person-centered theory of moral judgment, people seem to form impressions of helpers primarily based on the presumed underlying processes and motives of prosociality rather than its consequences. © 2020 Erlandsson et al.

The willingness to participate in biomedical research involving human beings in low- and middle-income countries: a systematic review,"OBJECTIVES: To systematically review reasons for the willingness to participate in biomedical human subjects research in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). METHODS: Five databases were systematically searched for articles published between 2000 and 2017 containing the domain of 'human subjects research' in 'LMICs' and determinant 'reasons for (non)participation'. Reasons mentioned were extracted, ranked and results narratively described. RESULTS: Ninety-four articles were included, 44 qualitative and 50 mixed-methods studies. Altruism, personal health benefits, access to health care, monetary benefit, knowledge, social support and trust were the most important reasons for participation. Primary reasons for non-participation were safety concerns, inconvenience, stigmatisation, lack of social support, confidentiality concerns, physical pain, efficacy concerns and distrust. Stigmatisation was a major concern in relation to HIV research. Reasons were similar across different regions, gender, non-patient or patient participants and real or hypothetical study designs. CONCLUSIONS: Addressing factors that affect (non-)participation in the planning process and during the conduct of research may enhance voluntary consent to participation and reduce barriers for potential participants.","Browne, Joyce L; Rees, Connie O; van Delden, Johannes J M; Agyepong, Irene; Grobbee, Diederick E; Edwin, Ama; Klipstein-Grobusch, Kerstin; van der Graaf, Rieke",Trop.

A theory of impact philanthropy,"This article develops a new model of altruism called impact philanthropy. An impact philanthropist is someone who wants to personally 'make a difference.' While that motive is straightforward, its logical implications are significantly different from other models of philanthropy. For example, the contributions of other donors can reduce an impact philanthropist's charitable fulfillment. As a result, cooperation among impact philanthropists can reduce aggregate giving. In addition, impact philanthropy can lead to a codependent relationship between givers and receivers in which both benefit from the other. Finally, the model suggests a conflict between charitable organizations and its donors concerning the allocation of charitable gifts. In particular, a charitable organization prefers to spread a donor's contribution across many goods, whereas a donor prefers to target his or her contribution at a specific good. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

The methodological approach takes into account that consumption of each charitable good affects consumption of the other. Using data from a national survey on household charitable giving, the results show that donations of time and money are substitutes. However, a decrease in the tax-price of monetary donations also has a positive effect on donations of time that acts outside the change in relative prices. This more than offsets the substitution effect leading to an overall positive correlation between the two charitable goods.","Feldman, N.E.",Am. Econ. J. Econ. Policy,1914

Self-other overlap: A unique predictor of willingness to work with people with disability as part of one's career,"Background People with disability (PWD) often rely on others, both for direct support and for the creation of enabling environments to meet their needs. This need makes it crucial for professionals to be willing to work with PWD, and for people to pursue careers that focus on supporting PWD. Objectives To explore self-other overlap as a unique predictor of willingness to work with PWD as part of one's career, using three studies. Methods Studies 1 and 2 used cross-sectional surveys of college undergraduates to explore: 1. whether an association between self-other overlap and willingness to work with PWD exists, and 2. whether self-other overlap is a unique predictor, controlling for attitudes and empathy. Study 3 investigated whether self-other overlap is associated with the groups with whom the students indicated they want (and do not want) to work as part of their career. Results Across the three studies, self-other overlap was uniquely associated with students' willingness to work with PWD as part of one's profession, even when controlling for attitudes and empathy. Conclusions Self-other overlap may be an important additional factor to take into consideration when developing interventions targeted toward promoting working with PWD. © 2019 Ioerger et al.","Ioerger, M.; Machia, L.V.; Turk, M.A.",PLoS ONE,1916

"A description of classroom help networks, individual network position, and their associations with academic achievement","This study examined how classroom peer relations can be described in terms of the network of help relations among students, and the positions students take up in this help network, and whether the structure of adolescent classroom help networks and individual network positions were associated with academic achievement. Help networks were based on the peer nomination question ""Who helps you with problems?"" Building on previous studies on classroom climate and individual network position, higher academic achievement was expected in classrooms with: a dense help network; no or a few network isolates (referring to students that did not give or receive help at all); less segmentation in help relations; equally distributed help nominations. In addition, higher achievement was expected for individuals with more helpers and a more central position in the help network. Using the Dutch SNARE data (54 classrooms; 1,144 students), the multilevel models suggested that lower achievement was related to an unequal distribution of help relations in a classroom. Moreover, the centrality of individuals in the help network was linked to higher achievement. Classrooms varied strongly on network dimensions, and networks that would theoretically be expected to be most beneficial for achievement (with high density, a few isolates, low segmentation, and high equality) turned out to be highly uncommon. The findings demonstrated that subtle network processes were relevant for academic success, and that classroom network characteristics are associated with classroom-level variation in academic achievement. Descriptive results underlined the complexity of the social context of classrooms, and the absence of’beneficial’ classrooms suggests that researchers should adjust their notion of what is a beneficial or detrimental classroom environment for adolescents. © 2018 van Rijsewijk et al.

Estate taxation and charitable bequests,"Charitable bequests in the United States amount to $2 billion annually and account for a substantial share of the total resources devoted to education, health, science, culture, welfare and religion. The amount and composition of such bequests are affected by the rate structure and deductibility of charitable bequests in the estate tax. A model of charitable bequests is estimated on data from the 1957-1959 Treasury Special Study and the 1969 Estate Tax returns. The price elasticity of charitable bequests is considerably greater than one for all but the very largest estates. Hence, the deduction is efficient in the sense of stimulating at least as much additional giving to charity as revenue lost by the Treasury. A variety of alternative policies are simulated.

We can see inside: Accurate prediction of Prisoner's Dilemma decisions in announced games following a face-to-face interaction,"Humans form impressions and make social judgments about others based on information that is quickly and easily available, such as facial and vocal traits. The evolutionary function of impression formation and social judgment mechanisms have received limited attention in psychology research; we argue that their function is to accurately forecast the behavior of others. There is some evidence for the predictive accuracy of social judgments, but much of it comes from situations where there is little incentive to deceive, which limits applicability to questions of the function of such mechanisms. A classic experiment that avoids this problem was conducted by R. H. Frank, T. Gilovich, and D. T. Regan (1993); their participants predicted each other's Prisoner's Dilemma Game decisions with above-chance accuracy after a short interaction period, knowing the game would follow. We report three original studies that replicate these aspects of the methods of Frank et al. (1993) and reanalyze data from all known replications. Our meta-analysis of these studies confirms the original report: humans can predict each other's Prisoner's Dilemma decisions after a brief interaction with people who have incentive to deceive. © 2016 The Authors.","Sparks, A.; Burleigh, T.; Barclay, P.",Evol.

Empathy as a mediator of the relations between parent and peer attachment and prosocial and physically aggressive behaviors in Mexican American college students,"Attachment and social support theories are normative developmental approaches that postulate positive social behavioral outcomes for individuals who develop strong relationships to parents and peers; however, research on positive aspects of Latinos in the United States is scarce. One hundred and forty-five Mexican American college students (M age = 23.05 years; 99 females) from state universities in the United States completed measures of parent and peer attachment, empathy, prosocial behaviors, and physical aggression. Structural equation models showed that both parent and peer attachments were associated with prosocial and physically aggressive behaviors. In general, empathy mediated the relations between peer attachment and both types of social behaviors but mostly for men and not women. Discussion focuses on the importance of attachment relationships and empathy in understanding prosocial and physically aggressive behaviors among Mexican American college students. © SAGE Publications 2012.","Carlo, G.; McGinley, M.; Hayes, R.C.; Martinez, M.M.",J.

Cross-cultural dataset for the evolution of religion and morality project,"A considerable body of research cross-culturally examines the evolution of religious traditions, beliefs and behaviors. The bulk of this research, however, draws from coded qualitative ethnographies rather than from standardized methods specifically designed to measure religious beliefs and behaviors. Psychological data sets that examine religious thought and behavior in controlled conditions tend to be disproportionately sampled from student populations. Some cross-national databases employ standardized methods at the individual level, but are primarily focused on fully market integrated, state-level societies. The Evolution of Religion and Morality Project sought to generate a data set that systematically probed individual level measures sampling across a wider range of human populations. The set includes data from behavioral economic experiments and detailed surveys of demographics, religious beliefs and practices, material security, and intergroup perceptions.

Estimating the influence of fairness on bargaining behavior,"The strength of bargainers' preferences for fair settlements has important implications for predicting negotiation outcomes and guiding bargaining strategy. Existing literature reports a few calibration exercises for social utility models, but the predictive accuracy of these models for out-of-sample forecasting remains unknown. Therefore, we investigate whether fairness considerations are stable enough across bargaining situations to be quantified and used to forecast bargaining behavior accurately. We develop a model that embeds a preference for fair treatment in a quantal response framework to account for noise and experience. In addition, we estimate preference for fairness (willingness to pay) using the simplest, one-round version of sequential bargaining games and then employ it to perform out-of-sample forecasts of multiple-round games of various lengths, discount factors, pie sizes, and levels of bargainer experience. Except in circumstances in which the bargaining pie is very small, the fitted model has significant and substantial out-of-sample explanatory power. The stability we find implies that the model and techniques might ultimately be extended to estimates of the influence of fairness on field negotiations, as well as across subpopulations. © 2008 INFORMS.","Bruyn, A.D.; Bolton, G.E.",Manage Sci,1924
The effect of nonprofits' taxable activities on the supply of private donations,"Prior research indicates that donations respond to price and income effects as well as to alternative sources of nonprofit financing. Using a database of confidential nonprofit tax returns, we examine the effects of nonprofits' taxable activities on the supply of donations. We find that each additional dollar of taxable revenues crowds-out approximately $0.55 of donations to arts, culture, and humanities organizations and human services and public benefit organizations, suggesting that the recent rapid expansion of nonprofits' taxable activities comes at a financial cost. We do not find that donations to educational or medical nonprofits are sensitive to taxable activities.","Yetman, M.H.; Yetman, R.J.",Natl. Tax J.,1925
"Environmental enhancement of prosocial television content: Effects on interpersonal behavior, imaginative play, and self-regulation in a natural setting","Investigated whether (a) prosocial TV can affect the behavior of urban poor children and (b) environmental supports that stimulate rehearsal and labeling of TV content are effective in a field setting. The social, imaginative, and self-regulatory behavior of 141 children aged 2 yrs 4 mo-5 yrs 4 mo in Head Start centers was observed before and during 1 of the following 4 experimental treatments: (a) neutral films, (b) prosocial TV only, (c) prosocial TV plus related play materials, and (d) prosocial TV plus related materials plus teacher training for rehearsal using verbal labeling and role playing. Ss in each condition saw 20 films in 8 wks. Prosocial TV alone produced few behavioral differencs from the control group. When classrooms were otherwise comparable, Ss receiving TV plus related materials had high levels of positive social interaction with peers and adults, of imaginative play, and of assertiveness and aggression. Those whose teachers were trained as well showed high levels of positive social interaction with peers, imaginative play, and assertiveness, but did not increase in aggression. Self-regulatory behavior was unaffected.

Inducing compliance by a two-door-in-the-face procedure and a self-determination request,"The door-in-the-face (“face”) is a procedure for increasing compliance. An individual is first asked to carry out a difficult task, which is almost always refused, and this is followed by a more moderate second request, the one that was actually desired. The current study devised a two-door-in-the-face (“two-face”) procedure, where the moderate request is preceded by both an extremely hard and a hard request, and examined whether this “two-face” procedure increased compliance when compared to the typical “face” procedure. In addition, the study examined whether a “self-determination” request, where the individual decides the level of help to offer, would produce more compliance than a fixed request, which specifies the level of help wanted. The Ss, 192 persons randomly selected from the telephone directory, were called and asked to help a new radio station. The results showed that the “two-face” when compared to the typical “face” procedure, and the self-determination request when compared to the fixed request significantly increased compliance. © 1981 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Goldman, M.; Creason, C.R.",J.

In praise of outsourcing,"What explains the context sensitivity of some (apparent) beliefs? Why, for example, do religious beliefs appear to control behaviour in some contexts but not others? Cases like this are heterogeneous, and we may require a matching heterogeneity of explanations, ranging over their contents, the attitudes of agents and features of the environment. In this paper, I put forward a hypothesis of the last kind. I argue that some beliefs (religious and non-religious) are coupled to cues, which either trigger an internal representation or even partially constitute the beliefs. I show that such coupling will give rise to the context-sensitivity, without entailing that religious believers take a different attitude to belief content. © 2018 by KONINKLIJKE BRILL NV, LEIDEN, The Netherlands.","Levy, N.",Contemp.

Ten years of research on group size and helping,"Reviews research that attempts to replicate and extend B. Latané and J. M. Dabbs's (1970) discovery that the presence of other people inhibits an individual from intervening in an emergency. Particular attention is paid to the nature of the precipitating incident, the ambiguity of the helping situation, laboratory vs field settings, characteristics of the Ss, victims, and other bystanders, and the amount and kinds of communication among bystanders. It is concluded that, despite the diversity of styles, settings, and techniques among the studies, the social inhibition of helping is a remarkably consistent phenomenon; however, victims are more likely to receive assistance when only a single individual witnesses the emergency.

Why don't we practice what we preach? A meta-analytic review of religious racism,"A meta-analytic review of past research evaluated the link between religiosity and racism in the United States since the Civil Rights Act. Religious racism partly reflects intergroup dynamics. That is, a strong religious in-group identity was associated with derogation of racial out-groups. Other races might be treated as out-groups because religion is practiced largely within race, because training in a religious in-group identity promotes general ethnocentrism, and because different others appear to be in competition for resources. In addition, religious racism is tied to basic life values of social conformity and respect for tradition. In support, individuals who were religious for reasons of conformity and tradition expressed racism that declined in recent years with the decreased societal acceptance of overt racial discrimination. The authors failed to find that racial tolerance arises from humanitarian values, consistent with the idea that religious humanitarianism is largely expressed to in-group members. Only religious agnostics were racially tolerant.","Hall, Deborah L; Matz, David C; Wood, Wendy",Pers. Soc. Psychol. Rev.,1934
Reconciliation Between Monetary Incentives and Motivation Crowding-Out: The Influence of Perceptions of Incentives on Research Performance,"Motivation crowding theories suggest that the influence of performance-based monetary incentives on performance may depend on how employees perceive the incentives. To examine the crowding-out effect, this article analyzed a panel dataset of faculty’s research published over 9 years in a Korean university, focusing on the moderating role of perceptions of incentives. We found that, as the university increased financial incentives for research performance, academic researchers who perceived the incentives as supportive published more papers in higher impact factor journals. In contrast, the quantity and quality of research performance of those who perceived such incentives as controlling were not significantly associated with the increase in the incentives. To improve the performance of the performance-incentive system with potential crowding-out effects, administrators should communicate with employees to help them perceive incentives as supportive and positive. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Kim, D.H.; Bak, H.-J.",Public Perform.

Immunotherapy for Guillain-Barre syndrome: a systematic review,"PE increases the rate of recovery and improves outcomes at 1 year in patients with GBS. There was insufficient evidence for IV Ig compared with no treatment, but IV Ig and PE appear to have similar effects. XCM: The review question was clear with respect to the participants, intervention and study design, although inclusion criteria were not explicitly defined. A number of studies that were included in the tables were not included in the review, and the reasons for this were unclear. It was not clear if the primary outcome was selected before or after reviewing potentially relevant studies. Several relevant sources were searched and attempts were made to minimise publication bias. It was not clear whether any language restrictions had been applied, so the potential for language bias could not be assessed. Only two validity criteria were assessed and the exact criteria on which these were assessed were unclear; this inadequate assessment makes it difficult to judge the reliability of the evidence presented. Methods were used to minimise reviewer error and bias in the study selection and data extraction processes, but it was unclear whether similar steps were taken in the assessment of validity. Where possible, the data were pooled statistically and potential sources of heterogeneity were examined. It is difficult to assess the reliability of the conclusions given the limited definition of inclusion criteria, the diversity of the studies, the unknown extent to which the data represent all patients with GBS, and the absence of a quality assessment of the included studies. The recommendations for further research appear justified. XIM: Practice: The authors did not state any implications for practice.

The Role of Company-Cause Fit and Company Involvement in Consumer Responses to CSR Initiatives: A Meta-Analytic Review,"The marketing literature suggests that company-cause fit is of key importance to developing a successful socially responsible initiative. However, controversy exists regarding the level of this fit. While some studies report that high fit between a company and a cause has beneficial effects on consumer responses to such efforts, other research identifies negative impacts. This paper aims to obtain a deeper insight into this issue by examining the moderating role of company involvement in a cause. A meta-analysis of 51 experimental studies, yielding a total sample size of 11,335 subjects, shows that company-cause fit influences consumer responses to CSR initiatives most positively when a company with a positive reputation is highly involved in a cause, that is, when the company donates at least products. If such a company provides its beneficiary with only monetary contributions (i.e., low involvement), the effects of fit are significantly less influential. © 2017 by the author.","Zasuwa, Grzegorz",Sustainability (Switzerland),1941
Why are women penalized for success at male tasks?: The implied communality deficit,"In 3 experimental studies, the authors tested the idea that penalties women incur for success in traditionally male areas arise from a perceived deficit in nurturing and socially sensitive communal attributes that is implied by their success. The authors therefore expected that providing information of communality would prevent these penalties. Results indicated that the negativity directed at successful female managers - in ratings of likability, interpersonal hostility, and boss desirability - was mitigated when there was indication that they were communal. This ameliorative effect occurred only when the information was clearly indicative of communal attributes (Study 1) and when it could be unambiguously attributed to the female manager (Study 2); furthermore, these penalties were averted when communality was conveyed by role information (motherhood status) or by behavior (Study 3). These findings support the idea that penalties for women's success in male domains result from the perceived violation of gender-stereotypic prescriptions.

Virtual Superheroes: Using Superpowers in Virtual Reality to Encourage Prosocial Behavior,"Background: Recent studies have shown that playing prosocial video games leads to greater subsequent prosocial behavior in the real world. However, immersive virtual reality allows people to occupy avatars that are different from them in a perceptually realistic manner. We examine how occupying an avatar with the superhero ability to fly increases helping behavior. Principal Findings: Using a two-by-two design, participants were either given the power of flight (their arm movements were tracked to control their flight akin to Superman's flying ability) or rode as a passenger in a helicopter, and were assigned one of two tasks, either to help find a missing diabetic child in need of insulin or to tour a virtual city. Participants in the ""super-flight"" conditions helped the experimenter pick up spilled pens after their virtual experience significantly more than those who were virtual passengers in a helicopter. Conclusion: The results indicate that having the ""superpower"" of flight leads to greater helping behavior in the real world, regardless of how participants used that power. A possible mechanism for this result is that having the power of flight primed concepts and prototypes associated with superheroes (e.g., Superman). This research illustrates the potential of using experiences in virtual reality technology to increase prosocial behavior in the physical world. © 2013 Rosenberg et al.","Rosenberg, R.S.; Baughman, S.L.; Bailenson, J.N.",PLoS ONE,1943
Anonymity versus privacy in the dictator game: Revealing donor decisions to recipients does not substantially impact donor behavior,"Anonymity is often offered in economic experiments in order to eliminate observer effects and induce behavior that would be exhibited under private circumstances. However, anonymity differs from privacy in that interactants are only unaware of each others' identities, while having full knowledge of each others' actions. Such situations are rare outside the laboratory and anonymity might not meet the requirements of some participants to psychologically engage as if their actions were private. In order to explore the impact of a lack of privacy on prosocial behaviors, I expand on a study reported in Dana et al. (2006) in which recipients were left unaware of the Dictator Game and given donations as ''bonuses'' to their show-up fees for other tasks. In the current study, I explore whether differences between a private Dictator Game (sensu Dana et al. (2006)) and a standard anonymous one are due to a desire by dictators to avoid shame or to pursue prestige. Participants of a Dictator Game were randomly assigned to one of four categories-one in which the recipient knew of (1) any donation by an anonymous donor (including zero donations), (2) nothing at all, (3) only zero donations, and (4) and only non-zero donations. The results suggest that a lack of privacy increases the shame that selfish-acting participants experience, but that removing such a cost has only minimal effects on actual behavior. ©2014 Jeffrey winking.","Winking, J.",PLoS ONE,1944
On the utility of alternative procedures for assessing psychological androgyny,"S. L. Bem's definition of psychological androgny as the integration of both masculinity and femininity within a single individual obscures a potentially important distinction between those individuals who score high on both masculinity and femininity and those who score low on both. To assess the importance of this distinction, the Bem Sex-Role Inventory was administered to 375 male and 290 female undergraduates, along with a variety of other pencil-and-paper questionnaires, and in addition, the results of Bem's earlier laboratory studies were reanalyzed with the low-low scorers separated out. High-high and low-low scorers did not differ significantly on the Attitudes Toward Women Scale, Rotter's Internal-External Locus of Control Scale, the Mach IV Scale, or the Attitudes Toward Problem-Solving Scale, nor did they differ significantly in 2 of Bem's 3 previous studies. Nevertheless, low-low scorers were significantly lower in self-esteem (Texas Social Behavior Inventory) than high-high scorers, they displayed significantly less responsiveness toward a kitten, and, among men, they reported significantly less self-disclosure (Jourard's Self-Disclosure Scale). Although the results are not consistent, it is concluded that a distinction between high-high and low-low scorers does seem to be warranted.

Can Reminders of Rules Induce Compliance? Experimental Evidence from a Common Pool Resource Setting,"This paper presents results from an RCT exploring whether a behavioural intervention can improve the conservation of a common pool resource. The literature on common pool resource management suggests that the existence of rules and sanctions is important to resource conservation. However, behavioural science suggests that individuals have finite cognitive capacity and may not be attentive to these rules and sanctions. This paper investigates the impact of an SMS message intervention designed to improve users’ knowledge of and attentiveness to existing forest use rules. An RCT in Uganda explores the impact of these messages on forest use and compliance with the rules. This paper finds that SMS messages raise the perceived probability of sanctions for rule-breakers. However, SMS messages do not induce full compliance with forest use rules or systematically reduce forest use. © 2020, The Author(s).","Eisenbarth, S.; Graham, L.; Rigterink, A.S.",Environ. Resour.

Parenting and prosocial behaviors: A meta-analysis,"Ascertaining whether and the extent to which different aspects of parenting are associated with prosocial behaviors could inform parenting programs in cultivating healthy development. Multilevel meta-analyses (k = 124) involving children and adolescents were conducted to examine associations between parenting and prosocial behaviors while accounting for demographic and study characteristics. Authoritative parenting (r =.174, p <.001) was associated positively whereas authoritarian parenting (r = −.107, p <.001) was associated negatively with prosocial behaviors. These associations remained robust across infancy, childhood, and adolescence in both individualistic and collectivistic cultures. These associations also were invariant across child and parent gender. Moderating effects relevant to the type of prosocial behaviors under examination were identified. Authoritative parenting was associated positively with general, public, emotional, anonymous, dire, compliant, and other specific types of prosocial behaviors (e.g., sharing), but associated negatively with altruistic prosocial behaviors. Authoritarian parenting was associated negatively with general and altruistic prosocial behaviors, but not other specific types. Moderating effects relevant to study design and informant of parenting were found. No moderating effects were identified for the informant and target of prosocial behaviors. Associations of permissive (r = −.096, p <.01) and neglecting parenting (r = −.054, p =.543) remain unclear due to insufficient number of studies and publication biases.

The leading eight: Social norms that can maintain cooperation by indirect reciprocity,"The theory of indirect reciprocation explains the evolution of cooperation among unrelated individuals, engaging in one-shot interaction. Using reputation, a player acquires information on who are worth cooperating and who are not. In a previous paper, we formalized the reputation dynamics, a rule to assign a binary reputation (good or bad) to each player when his action, his current reputation, and the opponent's reputation are given. We then examined all the possible reputation dynamics, and found that there exist only eight reputation dynamics named ""leading eight"" that can maintain the ESS with a high level of cooperation, even if errors are included in executing intended cooperation and in reporting the observation to the public. In this paper, we study the nature of these successful social norms. First, we characterize the role of each pivot of the reputation dynamics common to all of the leading eight. We conclude that keys to the success in indirect reciprocity are to be nice (maintenance of cooperation among themselves), retaliatory (detection of defectors, punishment, and justification of punishment), apologetic, and forgiving. Second, we prove the two basic properties of the leading eight, which give a quantitative evaluation of the ESS condition and the level of cooperation maintained at the ESS. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The dopaminergic reward system underpins gender differences in social preferences,"Women are known to have stronger prosocial preferences than men, but it remains an open question as to how these behavioural differences arise from differences in brain functioning. Here, we provide a neurobiological account for the hypothesized gender difference. In a pharmacological study and an independent neuroimaging study, we tested the hypothesis that the neural reward system encodes the value of sharing money with others more strongly in women than in men. In the pharmacological study, we reduced receptor type-specific actions of dopamine, a neurotransmitter related to reward processing, which resulted in more selfish decisions in women and more prosocial decisions in men. Converging findings from an independent neuroimaging study revealed gender-related activity in neural reward circuits during prosocial decisions. Thus, the neural reward system appears to be more sensitive to prosocial rewards in women than in men, providing a neurobiological account for why women often behave more prosocially than men. © 2017 The Author(s).","Soutschek, A.; Burke, C.J.; Raja Beharelle, A.; Schreiber, R.; Weber, S.C.; Karipidis, I.I.; Ten Velden, J.; Weber, B.; Haker, H.; Kalenscher, T.; Tobler, P.N.",Nat.

The evolution of gods’ minds in the Tyva Republic,"As appeals to what gods know and care about often motivate and rationalize human behavior, understanding shared models of gods’ minds is crucial for understanding religion’s contributions to human sociality. If religious systems function to minimize the effects of social and ecological problems, then models of gods’ concerns should coevolve with these problems. The present work assesses this prediction using data collected in the Tyva Republic. After briefly introducing the social and ecological history of ritual cairn piety in Inner Asia, I examine explicit representational models of morality, virtue, and gods’ concerns in Tyva. I show that (a) there is very little conceptual overlap between Tyvans’ models of morality and virtue and the things about which spirits care, (b) Tyvan spirit masters are primarily concerned with ritual and breaches of resourcemaintenance, and (c) among the emerging, salient factors that anger spirit masters are alcohol abuse and littering, very recent social problems in the region. This report provides support for the hypothesis that representational models of gods’ minds will evolve in accordance with ever-shifting local problems and offers the first formal treatment of empirically determining what constitutes a “moralistic” deity among living people. © 2016 by The Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research.

Greater Male Variability in Cooperation: Meta-Analytic Evidence for an Evolutionary Perspective,"Do men and women differ systematically in their cooperation behaviors? Researchers have long grappled with this question, and studies have returned equivocal results. We developed an evolutionary perspective according to which men are characterized by greater intrasex variability in cooperation as a result of sex-differentiated psychological adaptations. We tested our hypothesis in two meta-analyses. The first involved the raw data of 40 samples from 23 social-dilemma studies with 8,123 participants. Findings provided strong support for our perspective. Whereas we found that the two sexes do not differ in average cooperation levels, men are much more likely to behave either selfishly or altruistically, whereas women are more likely to be moderately cooperative. We confirmed our findings in a second meta-analytic study of 28 samples from 23 studies of organizational citizenship behavior with 13,985 participants. Our results highlight the importance of taking intrasex variability into consideration when studying sex differences in cooperation and suggest important future research directions. © The Author(s) 2020.","Thöni, C.; Volk, S.; Cortina, J.M.",Psychol.

Altruistic food sharing behavior by human infants after a hunger manipulation,"Altruistic behavior entails giving valuable benefits to others while incurring a personal cost. A distinctively human form of altruistic behavior involves handing nutritious food to needy strangers, even when one desires the food. Engaging in altruistic food transfer, instead of keeping the food, is costly, because it reduces the caloric intake of the benefactor vis-à-vis the beneficiary. Human adults engage in this form of altruistic behavior during times of war and famine, when giving food to others threatens one’s own survival. Our closest living primate relatives, chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and bonobos (Pan paniscus), exhibit notable constraints on the proclivity to engage in such food transfer (particularly chimpanzees), although they share many social-cognitive commonalities with humans. Here we show that in a nonverbal test, 19-month-old human infants repeatedly and spontaneously transferred high-value, nutritious natural food to a stranger (Experiment 1) and more critically, did so after an experimental manipulation that imposed a feeding delay (Experiment 2), which increased their own motivation to eat the food. Social experience variables moderated the expression of this infant altruistic behavior, suggesting malleability. © 2020, The Author(s).","Barragan, R.C.; Brooks, R.; Meltzoff, A.N.",Sci. Rep.,1954

The unresponsive avenger: More evidence that disinterested third parties do not punish altruistically,"Many social scientists believe humans possess an evolved motivation to punish violations of norms-including norm violations that do not harm them directly. However, most empirical evidence for so-called altruistic punishment comes from experimental economics games that create experimental demand for third-party punishment, raising the possibility that the third-party punishment uncovered in these experiments has been motivated by a desire to appear concerned about social norms rather than by actual concern about upholding them. Here we present the results of five experiments in which we used an aggression paradigm to contrast second-party and third-party punishment with minimal experimental demand. We also summarize the results of these experiments meta-analytically. We found robust evidence that participants who were insulted by a stranger experienced anger and punished the insulter. To a lesser degree, participants who witnessed a friend receive an insult also became angry and punished the insulter. In contrast, we found robust evidence that participants who witnessed a stranger receive an insult did not punish the insulter, although they did experience modest amounts of anger. In only one experiment did we find any punishment on behalf of a stranger, and this result could plausibly be explained by the desire to escape the moral censure of other bystanders. Our results suggest that experimental designs that rely on demand-laden methods to test hypotheses about third-party punishment may have overstated the case for the existence of this trait.

"Who is Left Behind? Altruism of Giving, Happiness and Mental Health during the Covid-19 Period in the UK","The UK government has decided to implement lockdown measures at the end of March 2020 as a response to the outbreak and spread of the Covid-19 pandemic. As a consequence, households have experienced job losses and a significant drop in their finances. During these unprecedented and difficult times, people provide financial assistance to those who are in need and have to cope with falls in their living standards. In this study we are interested to investigate the subjective well-being, which is expressed by mental health and components of general happiness, of the givers rather than of receivers. We apply a difference-in-differences framework to investigate the impact of altruism on the givers’ SWB in the UK. Altruism is denoted by transfers made to adult children, parents, siblings, and friends. Using the DiD estimator and the estimated coefficient of the household income we calculate the implicit willingness-to-pay (WTP) for altruism. We perform various regressions by gender and racial-ethnic background using data from the UK Household Longitudinal Study (UKHLS). The analysis shows that altruistic behaviours impact different domains of SWB between men and women, as well as, among people with different racial-ethnic background. © 2020, The Author(s).","Giovanis, E.; Ozdamar, O.",Appl.

Cues of being watched enhance cooperation in a real-world setting,"We examined the effect of an image of a pair of eyes on contributions to an honesty box used to collect money for drinks in a university coffee room. People paid nearly three times as much for their drinks when eyes were displayed rather than a control image. This finding provides the first evidence from a naturalistic setting of the importance of cues of being watched, and hence reputational concerns, on human cooperative behaviour. © 2006 The Royal Society.","Bateson, M.; Nettle, D.; Roberts, G.",Biol.

Do public subsidies leverage private philanthropy for the arts? Empirical evidence on symphony orchestras,"The relationship between public subsidies and private philanthropy is at the heart of a common claim that state subsidies ""leverage"" private donations to the arts. This claim might seem counterintuitive to some who find it more likely that state funding would crowd out private donations. This article empirically tests this question, using panel data on five major American symphony orchestras. The principal result of the statistical analysis is that neither claim is correct for these orchestras: The two funding sources are independent. This finding has significant managerial implications with respect to revenue-raising strategies for arts organizations as well as nonprofit firms in general. These implications and several related policy issues are discussed.","Brooks, A.C.",Nonprofit Volunt. Sect. Q.,1961

Measuring the Effectiveness of Mass-Mediated Health Campaigns Through Meta-Analysis,"A meta-analytic review was undertaken to examine the effects of mass communication campaigns on changes in behavior, knowledge, and self-efficacy in the general public. A review of the academic literature was undertaken and identified 1,638 articles from 1966 through 2012. Using strict inclusion criteria, we included 63 studies for coding and analyses. Results from these efforts indicated that campaigns produced positive effects in behavior change (r =.05, k = 61) and knowledge (r =.10, k = 26) but failed to produce significant increases in self-efficacy (r =.02, k = 14). Several moderators (e.g., health topic, the theory underlying the campaign) were examined in relation to campaign principles that are prescribed to increase campaign effects. The major findings are reviewed, and the implications for future campaign design are discussed. © Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Anker, A.E.; Feeley, T.H.; McCracken, B.; Lagoe, C.A.",J.

The role of the justice motive in economic decision making,"In two studies, a dictator game was used to investigate the hypotheses that two types of justice motives should be differentiated, the need to belief in a just world and a self-attributed justice motive, that both justice motives could explain the decision for equal allocations, and that the explicit justice motive could explain the avoidance of an egoistic allocation. In Study 1, both justice motives predicted equally well the decision for an equal allocation, whereas the explicit justice motive predicted the avoidance of an egoistic allocation. A similar pattern of results emerged in Study 2. Additionally, the explicit but not the implicit justice motive covaried with social desirability, and social desirability explained the decision for equality and the avoidance of an egoistic allocation just as well as the explicit justice motive. Finally, allocation decisions were better explained in Study 2, where real money was at stake. The findings support the idea that allocation decisions can best be understood by taking the just world justice motive and social desirability into account. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Turtle hunting and tombstone opening: Public generosity as costly signaling,"Costly signaling theory (CST) offers an explanation of generosity and collective action that contrasts sharply with explanations based on conditional reciprocity. This makes it particularly relevant to situations involving widespread unconditional provisioning of collective goods. We provide a preliminary application of CST to ethnographic data on turtle hunting and public feasting among the Meriam of Torres Strait, Australia. Turtle hunting appears to meet the key conditions specified in CST: it is (1) an honest signal of underlying abilities such as strength, risk-taking, skill, and leadership; (2) costly in ways not subject to reciprocation; (3) an effective means of broadcasting signals, since the collective good (a feast) attracts a large audience; and (4) seems to provide benefits to signalers (turtle hunters) as well as recipients (audience). We conclude with some suggestions as to the broader implications of this research, and the costly signaling paradigm in general, for understanding collective action and generosity in human social groups. © 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.

The effect of government grants on private giving to East Asian nonprofits: Implications for social work managers,"For effective financial management, social work managers must clearly grasp the relationship between government grants and private contributions, which is frequently characterized as crowding-out effects. Crowding-out effects have been investigated for various types of nonprofits in the U.S., and the results have been mixed. In spite of its popularity in nonprofit research, the theory has not been applied to nonprofits serving minority communities. This is the first pilot crowding-out study looking at East Asian nonprofit organizations, including Chinese, Korean, and Japanese-American nonprofits in the NY and NJ metropolitan area (n = 410). Through a panel analysis, the current study found a significant crowding-in effect for donations to East Asian-American nonprofits (p <.01). The relationship between government grants and private giving was different for each East Asian-American nonprofit organization. Particularly, donors of Chinese and Japanese-American nonprofit organizations donated more money when their charities received more government grants (p <.05). In contrast, we found crowding-out effects for Korean-American nonprofit organizations, but the result was not significant (p >.05). The estimated crowding-in effects of government grants on private giving by each of the East Asian countries were explicated based on each country’s social, political, and cultural background such as the quality of the charity, transparency, and political trust. Social work managers in ethnic nonprofit organizations should establish different strategies to help shape donor giving patterns according to the effect of government grants. © 2020 Authors.","Lee, L.H.; Kim, S.-J.",Adv. soc.

Patients or volunteers? The impact of motivation for trial participation on the efficacy of patient decision Aids: a secondary analysis of a Cochrane systematic review,"BACKGROUND: Efficacy of patient decision aids (PtDAs) may be influenced by trial participants' identity either as patients seeking to benefit personally from involvement or as volunteers supporting the research effort. AIM: To determine if study characteristics indicative of participants' trial identity might influence PtDA efficacy. METHODS: We undertook exploratory subgroup meta-analysis of the 2011 Cochrane review of PtDAs, including trials that compared PtDA with usual care for treatment decisions. We extracted data on whether participants initiated the care pathway, setting, practitioner interactions, and 6 outcome variables (knowledge, risk perception, decisional conflict, feeling informed, feeling clear about values, and participation). The main subgroup analysis categorized trials as ""volunteerism"" or ""patienthood"" on the basis of whether participants initiated the care pathway. A supplementary subgroup analysis categorized trials on the basis of whether any volunteerism factors were present (participants had not initiated the care pathway, had attended a research setting, or had a face-to-face interaction with a researcher). RESULTS: Twenty-nine trials were included. Compared with volunteerism trials, pooled effect sizes were higher in patienthood trials (where participants initiated the care pathway) for knowledge, decisional conflict, feeling informed, feeling clear, and participation. The subgroup difference was statistically significant for knowledge only (P = 0.03). When trials were compared on the basis of whether volunteerism factors were present, knowledge was significantly greater in patienthood trials (P < 0.001), but there was otherwise no consistent pattern of differences in effects across outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: There is a tendency toward greater PtDA efficacy in trials in which participants initiate the pathway of care. Knowledge acquisition appears to be greater in trials where participants are predominantly patients rather than volunteers.","Brown, James G; Joyce, Kerry E; Stacey, Dawn; Thomson, Richard G",Med.

Payoff-based learning explains the decline in cooperation in public goods games,"Economic games such as the public goods game are increasingly being used to measure social behaviours in humans and non-human primates. The results of such games have been used to argue that people are pro-social, and that humans are uniquely altruistic, willingly sacrificing their own welfare in order to benefit others. However, an alternative explanation for the empirical observations is that individuals are mistaken, but learn, during the game, how to improve their personal payoff. We test between these competing hypotheses, by comparing the explanatory power of different behavioural rules, in public goods games, where individuals are given different amounts of information. We find: (i) that individual behaviour is best explained by a learning rule that is trying to maximize personal income; (ii) that conditional cooperation disappears when the consequences of cooperation are made clearer; and (iii) that social preferences, if they exist, are more anti-social than pro-social. © 2015 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

What Is Ego Depletion? Toward a Mechanistic Revision of the Resource Model of Self-Control,"According to the resource model of self-control, overriding one's predominant response tendencies consumes and temporarily depletes a limited inner resource. Over 100 experiments have lent support to this model of ego depletion by observing that acts of self-control at Time 1 reduce performance on subsequent, seemingly unrelated self-control tasks at Time 2. The time is now ripe, therefore, not only to broaden the scope of the model but to start gaining a precise, mechanistic account of it. Accordingly, in the current article, the authors probe the particular cognitive, affective, and motivational mechanics of self-control and its depletion, asking, ""What is ego depletion?"" This study proposes a process model of depletion, suggesting that exerting self-control at Time 1 causes temporary shifts in both motivation and attention that undermine self-control at Time 2. The article highlights evidence in support of this model but also highlights where evidence is lacking, thus providing a blueprint for future research. Though the process model of depletion may sacrifice the elegance of the resource metaphor, it paints a more precise picture of ego depletion and suggests several nuanced predictions for future research. © The Author(s) 2012.","Inzlicht, M.; Schmeichel, B.J.",Perspect.

The Effects of Prosocial and Aggressive Videogames on Children’s Donating and Helping,"We investigated the effects of a prosocial and an aggressive videogame on children’s prosocial behavior. Third-, fourth-, seventh-, and eighth-grade boys and girls (N = 160) were randomly assigned to either a control condition or one of four treatment conditions. In two of the treatment conditions, children played a videogame with prosocial content either singly or cooperatively with another child. In the other two conditions, children played an aggressive videogame either singly or competitively. Subsequent levels of donating and helping were measured. A three-way analysis of variance indicated that older students donated significantly more than did younger students. Children who played either of the aggressive videogames donated significantly less than did those who played prosocial games by themselves. No significant effects were found for helping. Playing the prosocial videogame did not increase prosocial responding, but playing the aggressive videogame tended to suppress this behavior. The failure of the prosocial game to accelerate prosocial responding might be due to the relatively brief treatments used in this study and/or to the particular prosocial videogame utilized. © 1987 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Chambers, J.H.; Ascione, F.R.",J.

Religiosity and prosocial behaviours in adolescence: The mediating role of prosocial values,"This study examined the hypothesis that religiosity would be differentially related to six types of adolescent prosocial behaviour, and that these relations would be mediated by the prosocial value of kindness. Self-report data were collected from 142 high school students (63 per cent female; 91 per cent White; M age=16.8, S=.80). Religiosity was a significant positive predictor of kindness, as well as compliant, anonymous and altruistic prosocial behaviour, but not public, dire and emotional prosocial behaviour. Associations between religiosity and both compliant and altruistic prosocial behaviours were mediated by kindness. Direct and indirect paths were found between religiosity and anonymous prosocial behaviour. Thus, partial support was found for the mediational hypothesis. Discussion focused on the utility of distinguishing among different types of prosocial behaviours and on the role of religion and values in promoting moral education. © 2005 Journal of Moral Education Ltd.","Hardy, S.A.; Carlo, G.",J.

"Media campaigns to promote smoking cessation among socioeconomically disadvantaged populations: What do we know, what do we need to learn, and what should we do now","There was considerable evidence that media campaigns to promote smoking cessation at the overall population level were often less effective, sometimes equally effective and rarely more effective among disadvantaged populations relative to more advantaged populations. Many of these campaigns could have the unintended effect of increasing or maintaining existing disparities in smoking rates and the mortality burden of tobacco by socio-economic status. XCM: Inclusion criteria were clearly defined for intervention, participants and outcomes, but were not defined for study design. Some relevant sources were searched, but no attempts were made to reduce publication bias. It was unclear whether language limitations were applied. Methods used to select studies and extract data were not described and so it was not known whether efforts were made to reduce reviewer errors and bias. Some characteristics of the included studies were presented in tables; however, types of study designs used and validity of the studies were not reported, which made it difficult to assess the reliability of the data. Results were often reported without supporting data and assessments of statistical significance. The authors reported that due to their search strategy focusing particularly on African American and Hispanic smokers, other low socio-economic groups may have been excluded. Most included studies reported on media campaigns that were part of larger multi-component programs; therefore, the authors correctly commented on the difficulty of attribution of effects solely to media campaigns. A narrative review was appropriate given the differences between studies in terms of interventions, outcomes and participants. The authors' conclusions appear reasonable, but the interpretation and reliability of the findings was unclear due to the poor reporting of the review methods and included data. XIM: Practice: The authors stated that promotion of self-help materials or quit-to-win contests should not be conducted in isolation. Media campaigns should strive to ensure wide exposure, including paid media campaigns, earned media coverage, donated media time and direct marketing. These should be combined, where possible, with other tobacco control program components. In addition when designing messages, media campaigns should consider the literacy needs, language preferences and cultural values of low socio-economic smokers.Research: The authors stated that future research should compare effects of media campaigns for smoking cessation by socio-economic status and test for differences at multiple stages of response. There was also a need to develop theoretical frameworks to understand campaign effects among low socio-economic smokers. Research should be conducted to understand the media use preferences and health-related behaviour among low socio-economic smokers to understand motivation and ensure adequate exposure.","Niederdeppe, J; Kuang, X; Crock, B; Skelton, A",,1981
A novel approach to increasing inventory with the current panel: Increasing donation frequency by asking for a different blood product,"BACKGROUND: Ongoing shortages of blood products may be addressed through additional donations. However, donation frequency rates are typically lower than medically possible. This preliminary study aims to determine voluntary nonremunerated whole blood (WB) and plasmapheresis donors' willingness, and subsequent facilitators and barriers, to make additional donations of a different type. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Forty individual telephone interviews were conducted posing two additional donation pattern scenarios: first, making a single and, second, making multiple plasmapheresis donations between WB donations. Stratified purposive sampling was conducted for four samples varying in donation experience: no-plasma, new-to-both-WB-and-plasma, new-to-plasma, and plasma donors. Interviews were analyzed yielding excellent (κ values > 0.81) interrater reliability. RESULTS: Facilitators were more endorsed than barriers for a single but not multiple plasmapheresis donation. More new-to-both donors (n = 5) were willing to make multiple plasma donations between WB donations than others (n = 1 each) and identified fewer barriers (n = 3) than those more experienced in donation (n = 8 no plasma, n = 10 new to both, n = 11 plasma). Donors in the plasma sample were concerned about the subsequent reduced time between plasma donations by adding WB donations (n = 3). The no-plasma and new-to-plasma donors were concerned about the time commitment required (n = 3). CONCLUSION: Current donors are willing to add different product donations but donation history influences their willingness to change. Early introduction of multiple donation types, variation in inventory levels, and addressing barriers will provide blood collection agencies with a novel and cost-effective inventory management strategy. © 2015 AABB.","Bagot, K.L.; Masser, B.M.; White, K.M.",Transfusion,1982
Motivations of federal workers to volunteer in public sector special events,"Volunteers are considered a core component of special events and they have proved to be an asset to the execution of special events. Although motivations of volunteers have received a great deal of attention from many organizations and individuals in the private sector, little research has been done on motivations of volunteers in the public sector, or within the federal government. Therefore, this article identified motivational factors that prompt federal government workers to volunteer at a government-related special event. A survey was used to gather data from a volunteer sample of 263 individuals who had volunteered for public sector special events in recent years. Exploratory factor analysis and t test were employed to establish motivations that stimulate public sector employees to volunteer for special events and further determine the differences in motivation between females and males. The results showed that government workers mostly volunteer for purposive motive and external motive. In addition, gender played significant roles on egotistic and purposive motives. Thus, this research provides a unique theoretical contribution to research in event management by advancing our understanding of the process by which factors associated with motivation can lead to federal government workers volunteering at a government-related special event; subsequently, impacting how event planners and organizers of public sector special events market to and recruit volunteers. © 2020 Cognizant, LLC.","Artis, K.; Lee, S.H.",Event Manage.,1983

When is administrative efficiency associated with charitable donations?,"Whether accounting measures of administrative efficiency affect donations is an important issue for nonprofit managers. Prior research is inconclusive. Some studies find a significant negative relation, whereas others find no significant relation. The authors investigate a variety of reasons for the prior divergent results. The evidence is consistent with donors reducing contributions to organizations reporting higher administrative expense ratios when the ratios are presumably most relevant and reliable. The authors suggest that certain prior studies failed to find significant associations largely because their samples contained many organizations for which the administrative ratios were unreliable or not helpful for donor needs. Model specification issues also affect prior studies but are less critical than sample composition. When the authors replicate prior studies on samples containing established, donation-dependent organizations with nontrivial amounts of fund-raising and administrative expenses, they generally detect a significant negative association. © 2007 Association for Research on Nonprofit Organizations and Voluntary Action.","Tinkelman, D.; Mankaney, K.",Nonprofit Volunt.

Heritability of decisions and outcomes of public goods games,"Prosociality is one of the most distinctive features of human beings but there are individual differences in cooperative behavior. Employing the twin method, we examined the heritability of cooperativeness and its outcomes on public goods games using a strategy method. In two experiments (Study 1 and Study 2), twin participants were asked to indicate 1) how much they would contribute to a group when they did not know how much the other group members were contributing, and 2) how much they would contribute if they knew the contributions of others. Overall, the heritability estimates were relatively small for each type of decision, but heritability was greater when participants knew that the others had made larger contributions. Using registered decisions in Study 2, we conducted five Monte Carlo simulations to examine genetic and environmental influences on the expected game payoffs. For the simulated one-shot game, the heritability estimates were small, comparable to those of game decisions. For the simulated iterated games, we found that the genetic influences first decreased, then increased as the numbers of iterations grew. The implication for the evolution of individual differences in prosociality is discussed. © 2015 Hiraishi, Shikishima, Yamagata and Ando.","Hiraishi, K.; Shikishima, C.; Yamagata, S.; Ando, J.",Front.

Temporal predictability promotes prosocial behavior in 5-year-old children,"Although interpersonal coordinative activities have been shown to produce prosocial effects in both adults and children, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. While most approaches focus on the effect of mimicry and synchronous behavioral matching, we hypothesize that temporal predictability might play a central role in producing prosocial effects, as it directs coordination and might therefore strengthen shared intentionality. In a percussion task with pairs of 5-year old children, we manipulated temporal predictability and movement similarity/predictability between the pair's movements. Temporal predictability was manipulated by instructing the pair to play the instruments either to beats that were evenly-spaced, and therefore predictable, or to beats that were random, and therefore unpredictable. Movement similarity/predictability was manipulated by having the pair play rhythmic patterns that were similar, predictable, or independent from each other. Children who played to predictable beats were more willing to solve problems cooperatively with their partners and to help when their partners had an accident. In contrast, there was no positive effect of rhythmic predictability or similarity. These results are the first to show that temporal predictability affects prosociality independent of movement similarity or predictability. We conclude that the predictable time frame commonly seen in coordinative activities may be key to strengthening shared intentionality and producing prosocial effects. © 2019 Wan, Fu.

The National Sleep Foundation's Sleep Satisfaction Tool,"OBJECTIVES: The National Sleep Foundation (NSF) sought to test, refine, and add statistical rigor to its previously described provisional Sleep Satisfaction Tool (SST). The tool assesses the general population's sleep satisfaction. DESIGN: In 2017, NSF created a provisional tool through systematic literature review and an expert consensus panel process. This tool was expanded, refined, and tested through an open-ended survey, 2 rounds of cognitive testing, and a national survey of a random sample of Internet users (aged 18-90). Factor analysis and final consensus panel voting produced the robust SST. RESULTS: The exploratory, open-ended surveying for identifying additional factors important to the public led to question formulation around mind relaxation. Cognitive testing yielded significant refinement to question and response option formatting. Factor analysis of questions from field testing indicated loading on one construct identified as ""sleep satisfaction."" The final 9-item SST demonstrated strong reliability and internal validity with overall SST scores of 56/100 (higher scores indicating greater sleep satisfaction). Individual SST item mean scores ranged from 39 to 66, and overall SST scores varied substantially across demographic groups. CONCLUSIONS: NSF used a series of development and validation tests on its provisional SST, producing a novel and reliable research tool that measures the general population's sleep satisfaction. The SST is a short, reliable, nonclinical assessment that expands the set of tools available to researchers that implements the individual, social, and environmental factors related to sleep satisfaction. Further research will explore refined scoring methods along with factor weighting and use within different populations.","Ohayon, Maurice M; Paskow, Michael; Roach, Anita; Filer, Christine; Hillygus, D Sunshine; Chen, Michael C; Langer, Gary; Hirshkowitz, Max; National Sleep Foundation Sleep Satisfaction Consensus Panel",Sleep Health,1990

Live donor liver transplantation - adult outcomes: a systematic review,"Recipient outcomes are similar for adult-adult live donor (AA LDLT) and cadaver liver transplantation (CLT). There are small, but real, risks for live liver donors. Although live donor liver transplantation has the potential to help address the demand for livers, its current impact on waiting lists is relatively small.On the basis of the evidence presented in this systematic review, the ASERNIP-S Review Group agreed on the following classifications and recommendations concerning the donor and recipient safety and recipient efficacy of live donor liver transplantation:Classifications: Evidence rating - The available evidence was assessed as poor; however it is recognised that most of the evidence regarding the safety and efficacy of LDLT has to be derived from case series and registries. Even so, there are particular concerns about under-reporting of mortality and morbidity for both donors and recipients, which also contributes to the classification of poor.Safety - Donors: There is some risk of mortality and morbidity for LDLT donors, and the long term risks are unknown. (Since there is no comparator (except not donating), safety can only be described in absolute terms.)Efficacy - Donors: Not applicable, although clearly donors incur costs in terms of lost time and need for additional resources (financial and other).Safety - Recipients: Cannot be determined.Efficacy - Recipients: Cannot be determined.The panel recommended that strict guidelines are necessary for the performance of AA LDLT, in particular with respect to the process of LDLT donor selection, and contraindications for donor selection, and to the process of listing potential LDLT recipients. The Transplantation Society of Australia and New Zealand has developed guidelines for the performance of AA LDLT, which can be accessed online at http://www.racp.edu.au/tsanz.Additionally, the panel acknowledged the poor evidence available for LDLT, and suggested that all LDLT procedures need to be submitted to a registry, and that any centres not prepared to submit data should not be authorised to be transplant centres.","Middleton, P; Duffield, M; Lynch, S; Verran, D; House, T; Stanton, P; Stitz, R; Padbury, R; Maddern, G",,1992

The cognitive foundations of cooperation,"We conducted an experiment causally manipulating reliance on more intuitive vs. more deliberative behavior through time pressure and time delay. Our design uses a novel manipulation which relies on gradual economic incentives and was devised to avoid the high degree of non-compliance observed in previous experiments. The “social heuristic hypothesis,” which claims that people are intuitively predisposed to cooperate, is not supported in our data. On the aggregate, subjects are not more cooperative under gradually-incentivized time pressure. We also measured individual attitudes on social values and attitudes toward interpersonal risk, and find that both correlate with the tendency to cooperate. A detailed analysis suggests that subjects with a stronger (resp. weaker) prosocial predisposition become more (resp. less) cooperative under time pressure compared to time delay, although the effect is only noticeable for extreme-enough predispositions. A possible interpretation is that relying on more intuitive behavior enhances individual heterogeneous predispositions, while relying on more deliberative behavior moderates them. This suggests that tendencies toward cooperation might not be universal, and rather be moderated by individual characteristics. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Alós-Ferrer, C.; Garagnani, M.",J. Econ. Behav.

Acute stress and altruism in younger and older adults,"Recent studies of aging and decision making suggests that altruism increases with age. It is unclear, however, whether this pattern holds when choices are made under stress, as is often the case in real-world scenarios. The current study used an intertemporal choice task in which younger and older adults received a financial endowment before making a series of consequential intertemporal decisions involving gains, losses and charitable donations. Preceding the choice task, participants were exposed to a laboratory stressor. Physiological stress reactivity was a predictor of altruistic decision making in younger adults, such that individuals with higher stress reactivity made more generous choices. Older adults showed higher altruism than younger adults overall, with altruism unrelated to stress reactivity in older adults. These findings are consistent with an age-related change in the mechanisms underlying altruistic behavior. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Sparrow, E.P.; Armstrong, B.A.; Fiocco, A.J.; Spaniol, J.",Psychoneuroendocrinology,1998

Altruistic behaviors relieve physical pain,"Engaging in altruistic behaviors is costly, but it contributes to the health and well-being of the performer of such behaviors. The present research offers a take on how this paradox can be understood. Across 2 pilot studies and 3 experiments, we showed a pain-relieving effect of performing altruistic behaviors. Acting altruistically relieved not only acutely induced physical pain among healthy adults but also chronic pain among cancer patients. Using functional MRI, we found that after individuals performed altruistic actions brain activity in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and bilateral insula in response to a painful shock was significantly reduced. This reduced pain-induced activation in the right insula was mediated by the neural activity in the ventral medial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC), while the activation of the VMPFC was positively correlated with the performer's experienced meaningfulness from his or her altruistic behavior. Our findings suggest that incurring personal costs to help others may buffer the performers from unpleasant conditions. © 2020 National Academy of Sciences.

Perioperative allogeneic blood transfusion does not cause adverse sequelae in patients with cancer: a meta-analysis of unconfounded studies,"There is currently no evidence that allogeneic blood transfusion increases the risk of clinically important adverse sequelae (all-cause mortality, cancer recurrence and post-operative infection) in cancer patients undergoing surgery. More studies are required before a definitive statement can be made. XCM: The authors presented a well-defined review question and clear inclusion criteria.The validity of the included studies was thoroughly assessed by two investigators.The search strategy was very thorough and included an attempt to identify unpublished studies, although none were found. Sufficient details of the individual studies included were given, with the exception of the participants' gender and the length of follow-up.The authors examined sources of heterogeneity when it was present. The primary studies were summarised appropriately.The authors' conclusions follow logically from the results. XIM: The authors state that the most important conclusion to emerge from this meta-analysis is the need for more (and larger) RCTs comparing allogeneic blood products with appropriate active comparators, such as autologous or leucocyte depleted blood, in patients with cancer at time of operation.They also suggest that given the lack of evidence for increased risk from allogeneic blood transfusions, it seems appropriate to revisit the role of autologous blood donation programmes. This is particularly important given that almost half of the autologous blood donated before operation in the United States is discarded and formal economic analyses have questioned the cost effectiveness of these programmes.","McAlister, F A; Clark, H D; Wells, P S; Laupacis, A",,2002

The ultimatum game: raising the stakes,"This paper examines the motivation of players in the ultimatum game when the stakes involved are significant sums of money. A questionnaire approach is used to elicit matched pairs of offers and minimum acceptances from respondents for games in which the stake size increases from $10 to $10,000. Only 16% of our sample could be said to have selfish preferences, the rest of the sample behaved as if they were concerned with relative payoffs. There was some evidence that the concern with relativities was not as strong in the large stake games. Despite this observation, for 60% of the sample, the offer expressed as a proportion of the stake did not change as the stake increased, and 28% of the sample would have offered and accepted half the stake in the $10,000 game. © 1995.","Tompkinson, P.; Bethwaite, J.",J.

Maternal methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase C677T polymorphism and down syndrome risk: a meta-analysis from 34 studies,"BACKGROUND: Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) is a key enzyme of folate metabolic pathway which catalyzes the irreversible conversion of 5, 10-methylenetetrahydrofolate to 5-methyltetrahydrofolate. 5-methyltetrahydrofolate donates methyl group for the methylation of homocysteine to methionine. Several studies have investigated maternal MTHFR C677T polymorphism as a risk factor for DS, but the results were controversial and inconclusive. To come into a conclusive estimate, authors performed a meta-analysis. AIM: A meta-analysis of published case control studies was performed to investigate the association between maternal MTHFR C677T polymorphism and Down syndrome. METHODS: PubMed, Google Scholar, Elsevier, Springer Link databases were searched to select the eligible case control studies using appropriate keywords. The pooled odds ratio (OR) with 95%confidence interval were calculated for risk assessment. RESULTS: Thirty four studies with 3,098 DS case mothers and 4,852 control mothers were included in the present meta-analysis. The pooled OR was estimated under five genetic models and significant association was found between maternal MTHFR 677C>T polymorphism and Down syndrome under four genetic models except recessive model (for T vs. C, OR = 1.26, 95% CI = 1.09-1.46, p = 0.001; for TT vs. CC, OR = 1.49, 95% CI = 1.13-1.97, p = 0.008; for CT vs. CC, OR = 1.29, 95% CI = 1.10-1.51, p = 0.001; for TT+CT vs. CC, OR = 1.35, 95% CI = 1.13-1.60, p = 0.0008; for TT vs. CT+CC, OR = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.60-0.94, p = 0.01). CONCLUSION: The results of the present meta-analysis support that maternal MTHFR C677T polymorphism is a risk factor for DS- affected pregnancy.","Rai, Vandana; Yadav, Upendra; Kumar, Pradeep; Yadav, Sushil Kumar; Mishra, Om Prakesh",PLoS One,2005
Voluntary versus compulsory solidarity: Theory and experiment,"We present an overlapping-generations model with two interacting teams, where young team members earn an income, whereas old team members depend on either intrateam transfers from young members (voluntary solidarity) or tax-financed transfers (compulsory solidarity). We derive the individually and team-specifically optimal decisions and present further behavioral hypotheses, including the crowding out of voluntary by compulsory solidarity. We test our hypotheses in an experimental study and examine (1) whether raising taxes crowds out voluntary transfers, (2) how income distributions influence voluntary and compulsory solidarity, and (3) whether participants prefer more to less compulsory solidarity. © 2006 Mohr Siebeck.","Güth, W.; Sutter, M.; Verbon, H.",J.

A systematic review and meta-analysis of antecedents of blood donation behavior and intentions,"This meta-analysis sought to identify the strongest antecedents of blood donation behavior and intentions. It synthesized the results of 24 predictive correlational studies of donation behavior and 37 studies of donation intentions. The antecedents were grouped into six research programs: (1) the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) and its extensions, (2) prosocial motivation, (3) affective expectations, (4) donor site experience, (5) past donation behavior, and (6) donor demographics. Antecedent categories were cross-validated by multiple coders, and combined effect sizes were analyzed using a random-effects model. For donation behavior, medium positive associations were found with five of the constructs from the extended TPB: intentions to donate, perceived behavioral control, attitude toward donation, self-efficacy and donor role identity. Other antecedents displaying a positive association with donation behavior included anticipated regret for not donating, number of past donations and donor age. Donor experiences at the collection site in the form of temporary deferral or adverse reactions had a medium negative association with behavior. For donation intentions, strong positive associations were observed for perceived behavioral control, attitude, self-efficacy, role identity and anticipated regret. Medium positive associations were observed for personal moral norm, subjective norm, satisfaction, and service quality. All other potential antecedents had weak or non-significant associations with behavior and intentions. Several of these associations were moderated by between-study differences, including donor experience, the period of data collection in which donation behavior was observed, and the use of a nominal (yes/no return) versus a ratio measure of donation behavior. Collectively, the results underscore the importance of enhancing donors' attitudes towards donation and building their perceived behavioral control and self-efficacy to donate. Further, minimizing the risk of adverse reactions and enacting re-recruitment policies for temporarily deferred donors will help protect future donation behavior. Implications of these findings for blood collection agencies and researchers are discussed.","Bednall, Timothy C; Bove, Liliana L; Cheetham, Ali; Murray, Andrea L",Soc. Sci. Med.,2007
Cost-utility of living donor liver transplantation in a single Japanese center,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: Living donor liver transplantation is becoming increasingly important in the Western world, but the economic issues remain controversial. We conducted a cost-utility analysis to evaluate whether living donor liver transplantation is cost-effective. METHODOLOGY: Cost and utility analyses were performed in a longitudinal survey of a single center in Sapporo, Japan. Medical costs were derived from 11 patients who underwent living donor liver transplantation. Health utility was measured in quality-adjusted life year. Data for health utility scores were derived from 19 patients who underwent living donor liver transplantation. RESULTS: Median medical cost was U.S. dollars 154,626 from the first day of preoperative evaluation to 24 months post-transplantation. Cumulative quality-adjusted life years were 1.60 at 24 months after transplantation. Medical cost per quality-adjusted life year decreased progressively, leading to medical cost of U.S. dollars 605,131 per quality-adjusted life year at 3 months to U.S. dollars 94,169 at 24 months after transplantation. The results were sensitive to medical cost. CONCLUSIONS: Follow-up survey identified progressive increases in the cost-effectiveness of living donor liver transplantation for patients with end-stage liver disease. Living donor liver transplantation appears to represent a cost-effective medical technology.","Ishida, Kozo; Imai, Hirohisa; Ogasawara, Katsuhiko; Hagiwara, Kuniko; Furukawa, Hiroyuki; Todo, Satoru; Fujita, Hiroyoshi; Sakurai, Tsunetaro; Tamashiro, Hiko",Hepatogastroenterology,2008
The emotional dog and its rational tail: A social intuitionist approach to moral judgment,"Research on moral judgment has been dominated by rationalist models, in which moral judgment is thought to be caused by moral reasoning. The author gives 4 reasons for considering the hypothesis that moral reasoning does not cause moral judgment; rather, moral reasoning is usually a post hoc construction, generated after a judgment has been reached. The social intuitionist model is presented as an alternative to rationalist models. The model is a social model in that it deemphasizes the private reasoning done by individuals and emphasizes instead the importance of social and cultural influences. The model is an intuitionist model in that it states that moral judgment is generally the result of quick, automatic evaluations (intuitions). The model is more consistent than rationalist models with recent findings in social, cultural, evolutionary, and biological psychology, as well as in anthropology and primatology.","Haidt, J.",Psychol.

The effects of two sequential-request strategies on teachers' acceptability and use of a classroom intervention,"This study examined the effects of two sequential-request strategies - foot-in-the-door (FITD) and door-in-the-face (DITF)-on teachers' ratings of treatment acceptability and implementation of a classroom intervention. Sixty-one teachers were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 experimental conditions in which they complied with a small initial request, failed to comply with a large initial request, or received no initial request. Teachers then rated the acceptability of a classroom intervention that they were asked to implement for 1 hr on each of 2 consecutive school days. Results showed the mean acceptability ratings for the DITF condition to be significantly lower than the control condition, but neither differed significantly from the FITD condition. Fewer teachers in the DITF condition implemented the intervention than controls. The implications of these results for applying social influence strategies to school consultation are discussed.","Martens, B.K.; Kelly, S.Q.; Diskin, M.T.",J. Educ. Psychol. Consult.,2010
The Religious Orientation Scale: Review and Meta-Analysis of Social Desirability Effects,"Reliability and validity of scores on the Religious Orientation Scale (ROS) are reviewed with respect to social desirability. ROS measures intrinsic religiousness (I; religion as an end unto itself) and extrinsic religiousness (E; religion as a means to some end, like friendship or solace). Development of the scale is briefly traced, including the modification of the E scale to include two subscales. Scores from the I scale have good internal consistency reliability (.83), but scores from E subscales (Social and Personal) have marginal internal consistency reliability (.63 and .64, respectively). I tends to correlate with desirable variables (mental health, altruism, religious commitment), and E correlates with that which is undesirable (prejudice, nonmarital sex). Meta-analysis revealed that I correlates .15 with social desirability but that E does not. Given the religious relevancy of social desirability measures, partialing out this variance is not recommended.

More affected = more neglected: Amplification of bias in advice to the unidentified and many,"Professionals often give advice to many anonymous people. For example, financial analysts give public recommendations to trade stock, and medical experts formulate clinical guidelines that affect many patients. Normatively, awareness of the advice-recipient's identity should not influence the quality of advice, and when advice affects a larger number of people, if anything, greater care should be taken to ensure its accuracy. Yet, contrary to this logic and consistent with research on the identifiable victim effect, results from two experimental studies demonstrate that advisors confronting a financial conflict of interest give more biased advice to multiple than single recipients and to unidentified than identified single recipients. Increased intensity of feelings toward single identified recipients appears to drive this process; advisors experience more empathy and appear to have greater awareness and motivation to reduce bias in their advice when the recipient is single and identified. © The Author(s) 2012.","Sah, S.; Loewenstein, G.",Soc.

The resulting rich dataset also provides a testbed for comparing alternative specifications of the statistical model for analysing dictator game data.

Industry-funded versus non-profit-funded critical care research: a meta-epidemiological overview,"PURPOSE: To study the landscape of funding in intensive care research and assess whether the reported outcomes of industry-funded randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are more favorable. METHODS: We systematically assembled meta-analyses evaluating any type of intervention in the critical care setting and reporting the source of funding for each included RCT. Furthermore, when the intervention was a drug or biologic, we searched also the original RCT articles, when their funding information was unavailable in the meta-analysis. We then qualitatively summarized the sources of funding. For binary outcomes, separate summary odds ratios were calculated for trials with and without industry funding. We then calculated the ratio of odds ratios (RORs) and the summary ROR (sROR) across topics. ROR < 1 implies that the experimental intervention is relatively more favorable in trials with industry funding compared with trials without industry funding. For RCTs included in the ROR analysis, we also examined the conclusions of their abstract. RESULTS: Across 67 topics with 568 RCTs, 88 were funded by industry and another 73 had both industry and non-profit funding. Across 33 topics with binary outcomes, the sROR was 1.10 [95% CI (0.96-1.26), I2 = 1%]. Conclusions were not significantly more commonly unfavorable for the experimental arm interventions in industry-funded trials (21.3%) compared with trials without industry funding (18.2%). CONCLUSION: Industry-funded RCTs are the minority in intensive care. We found no evidence that industry-funded trials in intensive care yield more favorable results or are less likely to reach unfavorable conclusions.","Janiaud, Perrine; Cristea, Ioana-Alina; Ioannidis, John P A",Intensive Care Med.,2018
"Prosocial television and prosocial toddlers: A multi-method, longitudinal investigation","How screen use might affect early childhood outcomes is an important question for parents, but existing research is patchy. In particular, screen time is often examined in relation to sleep and aggression, but much less is known about its links with prosocial behaviour. To address this gap, we conducted semi-structured observations and interviews / questionnaires with both mothers and fathers in a sample of 195 (predominantly affluent and educated) British families tracked across three time-points, when the first-born child was 14-, 24-, and 36-months old. We also applied an objective coding scheme to assess the relative frequency of prosocial behaviour in the programmes and films children were watching at age 24-months. While our results showed no overall associations between prosocial behaviour and either screen time or screen content, there were interaction effects. Specifically, children whose favourite programmes were slow-paced and rich in prosocial content were particularly likely to show developmental gains in sharing. We discuss these findings in terms of their implications for parents, researchers, and policy makers. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","McHarg, G.; Hughes, C.",Infant Behav. Dev.,2019

After receiving the request the participants' verbal and behavioural compliance with the request were measured. The results indicated that the door-in-the-face procedure would be effective with requests to perform health-related behaviours.","Millar, M.G.",Psychol. Health Med.,2021

Effect of Gaze on Personal Space: A Japanese–German Cross-Cultural Study,"In East Asian cultures, people maintain larger interpersonal distances than in European or American cultures. We investigated whether a preference for averted gaze might be responsible for this difference. Typically, when measuring interpersonal distance, participants are asked to maintain eye contact. This request might bias findings due to cultural differences in the interpretation of direct gaze. We had Japanese and German participants adjust preferred interpersonal distance in a standardized laboratory task, using averaged faces with straight-ahead or averted gaze direction. In line with previous findings, Japanese participants preferred overall larger interpersonal distances, and female–female dyads preferred the smallest distances. In contrast, there was no pervasive effect of gaze on interpersonal distance, as confirmed with Bayesian statistics. Thus, differences in the reactions to mutual gaze cannot explain the cultural preferences for interpersonal distance. © The Author(s) 2018.","Sicorello, M.; Stevanov, J.; Ashida, H.; Hecht, H.",J.

On the social nature of eyes: The effect of social cues in interaction and individual choice tasks,"In an experimental setting, we applied a dual strategy to better understand the effect of pictures of eyes on human behavior. First, we investigated whether the effect of eyes was limited to interaction tasks in which the subjects' decisions influenced the outcomes of other subjects. We expanded the range of tasks to include individual choice tasks in which the subjects' decisions only influenced their own outcomes. Second, we investigated whether pictures of eyes were one of many social cues or were unique in their effect. We compared the effect of pictures of eyes with the effect of a different condition in which we presented the subjects with pictures of other students (peers). Our results suggest that the effect of pictures of eyes is limited to interaction tasks and that eyes should be considered distinct from other social cues, such as reminders of peers. While pictures of eyes uniformly enhanced pro-social behavior in interaction tasks, this was not the case for reminders of peers. Furthermore, the reminders of peers led to more rational behavior in individual choice tasks, whereas the effect of pictures of eyes was limited to situations involving interaction. Combined, these findings are in line with the claim that the effect of pictures of eyes on behavior is caused by a social exchange heuristic that works to enhance mutual cooperative behavior. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","Baillon, A.; Selim, A.; van Dolder, D.",Evol.

The development of a measure of prosocial behaviors for late adolescents,"The correlates and structure of prosocial behaviors in late adolescents were examined using a newly constructed multidimensional measure. In Study 1, 249 college students (145 women; M age = 19.9 years) were administered the Prosocial Tendencies Measure (PTM) which assesses 6 types of prosocial behaviors: altruistic, compliant, emotional, dire, public, and anonymous. Measures of sympathy, perspective taking, personal distress, social desirability, global prosocial behaviors, social responsibility, ascription of responsibility, vocabulary skills, and prosocial moral reasoning were also completed. Test-retest reliability and further validity of the PTM were demonstrated in Study 2 with a sample of 40 college students (28 women; M age = 22.9 years). Results from both studies yielded evidence of adequate reliability and validity of the PTM and support the notion of differentiated forms of helping.","Carlo, G.; Randall, B.A.",J.

Criticisms of the satiety hypothesis as an explanation for within-session decreases in responding,"The authors of four papers recently reported that satiation provides a better explanation than habituation for within-session decreases in conditioned responding. Several arguments question this conclusion. First, the contribution of habituation to within-session changes in responding seems clearly established. Information that is consistent with habituation, but that is difficult to reconcile with satiation, is not adequately addressed. Second, the limited evidence offered in support of satiation is ambiguous because the results are just as compatible with habituation as with other satiety variables. Finally, the term satiation is used in an intuitive way that is sometimes contradicted by research about the termination of ingestion. Use of the technical term satiation in a way that differs from its conventional usage will only isolate operant psychology from other areas of psychological research.","McSweeney, F.K.; Murphy, E.S.",J.

We show that a very weak form of identifiability - determining the victim without providing any personalizing information - increases caring. In the first, laboratory study, subjects were more willing to compensate others who lost money when the losers had already been determined than when they were about to be. In the second, field study, people contributed more to a charity when their contributions would benefit a family that had already been selected from a list than when told that the family would be selected from the same list.","Small, D.A.; Loewenstein, G.",J.

Beyond publication bias,"This review considers several meta-regression and graphical methods that can differentiate genuine empirical effect from publication bias. Publication selection exists when editors, reviewers, or researchers have a preference for statistically significant results. Because all areas of empirical research are susceptible to publication selection, any average or tally of significant/insignificant studies is likely to be biased and potentially misleading. Meta-regression analysis can see through the murk of random sampling error and selected misspecification bias to identify the underlying statistical structures that characterize genuine empirical effect. Meta-significance testing and precision-effect testing (PET) are offered as a means to identify empirical effect beyond publication bias and are applied to four areas of empirical economics research - minimum wage effects, union-productivity effects, price elasticities, and tests of the natural rate hypothesis. © Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2005.","Stanley, T.D.",J.

Cost-effectiveness of cell salvage and alternative methods of minimising perioperative allogeneic blood transfusion: a systematic review and economic model,"OBJECTIVES: To compare patient outcomes, resource use and costs to the NHS and NHS Blood Transfusion Authority (BTA) associated with cell salvage and alternative methods of minimising perioperative allogeneic blood transfusion. DATA SOURCES: Electronic databases covering the period 1996-2004 for systematic reviews and 1994-2004 for economic evidence. REVIEW METHODS: Existing systematic reviews were updated with data from selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that involved adults scheduled for elective non-urgent surgery. Any resource use or cost data were extracted for potential use in populating an economic model. Relative risks or weighted mean difference of each outcome for each intervention were assessed, taking into account the number of RCTs included in each outcome and intervention and the presence of any heterogeneity. This allowed indirect comparison of the relative effectiveness of each intervention when the intervention is compared with allogeneic blood transfusion. A decision analytic model synthesised clinical and economic data from several sources, to estimate the relative cost-effectiveness of cell salvage for people undergoing elective surgery with moderate to major expected blood loss. The perspective of the NHS and patients and a time horizon of 1 month were used. The economic model was developed from reviews of effectiveness and cost-effectiveness and clinical experts. Secondary analysis explored the robustness of the results to changes in the timing and costs of cell salvage equipment, surgical procedure, use of transfusion protocols and time horizon of analysis. RESULTS: Overall, 668 studies were identified electronically for the update of the two systematic reviews. This included five RCTs, of which two were cell salvage and three preoperative autologous donation (PAD). Five published systematic reviews were identified for antifibrinolytics, fibrin sealants and restrictive transfusion triggers, PAD plus erythropoietin, erythropoietin alone and acute normovolaemic haemodilution (ANH). Twelve published studies reported full economic evaluations. All but two of the transfusion strategies significantly reduced exposure to allogeneic blood. The relative risk of exposure to allogeneic blood was 0.59 for the pooled trials of cell salvage (95% confidence interval: 0.48 to 0.73). This varied by the type and timing of cell salvage and type of surgical procedure. For cell salvage, the relative risk of allogeneic blood transfusion was higher in cardiac surgery than in orthopaedic surgery. Cell salvage had lower costs and slightly higher quality-adjusted life years compared with all of the alternative transfusion strategies except ANH. The likelihood that cell salvage is cost-effective compared with strategies other than ANH is over 50%. Most of the secondary analyses indicated similar results to the primary analysis. However, the primary and secondary analyses indicated that ANH may be more cost-effective than cell salvage. CONCLUSIONS: The available evidence indicates that cell salvage may be a cost-effective method to reduce exposure to allogeneic blood transfusion. However, ANH may be more cost-effective than cell salvage. The results of this analysis are subject to the low quality and reliability of the data used and the use of indirect comparisons. This may affect the reliability and robustness of the clinical and economic results. There is a need for further research that includes adequately powered high-quality RCTs to compare directly various blood transfusion strategies. These should include measures of health status, health-related quality of life and patient preferences for alternative transfusion strategies. Observational and tracking studies are needed to estimate reliably the incidence of adverse events and infections transmitted during blood transfusion and to identify the lifetime consequences of the serious hazards of transfusion on mortality, health status and health-related quality of life.","Davies, L; Brown, T J; Haynes, S; Payne, K; Elliott, R A; McCollum, C",Health Technol.

Congruent with this analysis, results revealed that relative to individualists and competitors, prosocial individuals exhibited greater levels of secure attachment (Studies 1 and 2) and reported having more siblings, especially sisters (Study 3). Finally, the prevalence of prosocials increased - and the prevalence of individualists and competitors decreased - from early adulthood to middle adulthood and old age (Study 4).

Previous research has shown that improving knowledge, providing feedback on past behaviour and targeting social norms are promising approaches to improve hand hygiene practices. The present field experiment was designed to direct people on when to perform hand hygiene and prevent forgetfulness. This intervention is the first to examine the effect of inducing injunctive social norms via an emoticon-based feedback system on hand hygiene behaviour. Electronic monitoring and feedback devices were installed in hospital patient rooms on top of hand-rub dispensers, next to the doorway, for a period of 17 weeks. In the emoticon condition, screens at the devices activated whenever a person entered or exited the room. Before using the alcohol-based hand-rub dispenser, a frowny face was displayed, indicating that hand hygiene should be performed. If the dispenser was subsequently used, this picture changed to a smiley face to positively reinforce the correct behaviour. Hand hygiene behaviour in the emoticon rooms significantly outperformed the behaviour in three other tested conditions. The strong effect in this field experiment indicates that activating injunctive norms may be a promising approach to improve hand hygiene behaviour. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed. © 2018 Gaube et al.

"Tax incentives, Individual characteristics and charitable giving in Singapore","Previous studies conducted for developed countries like the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom have often found charitable giving by individuals to depend on income, the tax price of giving, and other variables. This article makes use of confidential tax file data to conduct a similar study for Singapore, a rapid-growing newly-industrializing country. The results indicate that disposable income, the tax price of giving, donor's age and educational attainment are important determinants of charitable giving by individuals. Donations are found to be income-inelastic but higly price-elastic. Thus, lowering the price of giving through tax incentives can be very effective in encouraging private donations to cliarity.","Chua, V.C.H.; Wong, C.M.",Int. J. Soc. Econ.,2040

Five rules for the evolution of cooperation,"Cooperation is needed for evolution to construct new levels of organization. Genomes, cells, multicellular organisms, social insects, and human society are all based on cooperation. Cooperation means that selfish replicators forgo some of their reproductive potential to help one another. But natural selection implies competition and therefore opposes cooperation unless a specific mechanism is at work. Here I discuss five mechanisms for the evolution of cooperation: kin selection, direct reciprocity, indirect reciprocity, network reciprocity, and group selection. For each mechanism, a simple rule is derived that specifies whether natural selection can lead to cooperation.","Nowak, M.A.",Science,2042
Gendered Help at the Workplace: Implications for Organizational Power Relations,"One of the most thoroughly studied aspects of prosocial workplace behavior is organizational citizenship behavior (OCB). Yet, the definition of OCB seems to overlook the fact that help-giving acts may be of different types with different consequences for both giver and recipient. The present research explores workplace help-giving behavior by investigating the importance of gender as a factor that facilitates or inhibits specific types of help that empower and disempower independent coping: autonomy- and dependency-oriented help, respectively. A pilot and two following studies were conducted. The pilot study empirically assessed which acts would be clearly perceived by participants as representing both types of help. Then, using the descriptions of these acts, Study 1 examined which type of help would be perceived as most likely to be given by a male or female employee to a male or female colleague in a sample of 226 participants (78% women). Study 2 explored which type of help participants perceived as one they would rather receive from a male or female helper in a sample of 170 participants (65% women). Our findings indicate that male and female respondents who rated men giving help were more likely to expect them to give autonomy-oriented help, especially to women. There were no significant differences in dependency-oriented help. Further, women preferred to receive more autonomy-oriented help than men did, regardless of the help-giver’s gender; no significant results were found for men. Implications for OCB and workplace power relations are discussed. © The Author(s) 2018.","Chernyak-Hai, L.; Waismel-Manor, R.",Psychol. Rep.,2043

Charitable contributions and intergenerational transfers,"This paper investigates the effects of bequest taxes and the income of children on the lifetime charitable contributions of parents. Using matched income tax records for parents and children, the results show a positive elasticity of 0.6 for contributions with respect to the tax price of bequests. The paper also finds that the income of children affects the amount that parents contribute to charity. The results show a positive elasticity of up to 0.14 for contributions by parents with respect to the income of children, implying that when children are better off, parents are likely to increase charitable giving.","Auten, G.; Joulfaian, D.",J.

How Did the Great Recession Affect Charitable Giving?,"A great deal of research has studied the effects of income and tax changes on charitable giving. However, little work has focused on how these relationships were affected by the Great Recession. This article estimates the tax and income effects using the 2009 Panel Study of Income Dynamics. The estimates are notably different than the typical findings from before the recession. Most importantly, tax effects are higher and income effects are lower. These unusual patterns are more pronounced for secular giving than for religious giving, and the effects are muted when only considering tax itemizers. The estimates are used to develop policy analytic results, considering the effects of the 2013 personal income tax rate increases and possible tax deduction limits currently under consideration. I find the tax increases to have a moderately stimulative impact on giving but predict a cap on charitable deductions would have a large negative impact. © The Author(s) 2017.","Brooks, A.C.",Public Financ.

"Altruism, fast and slow? Evidence from a meta-analysis and a new experiment","Can we use the lens of dual-system theories to explain altruistic behavior? In recent years this question has attracted the interest of both economists and psychologists. We contribute to this emerging literature by reporting the results of a meta-study of the literature and a new experiment. Our meta-study is based on 22 experimental studies conducted with more than 12,000 subjects. We show that the overall effect of manipulating cognitive resources to promote the “intuitive” system at the expense of the “deliberative” system is very close to zero. One reason for this null result could be that promoting intuition has heterogeneous effects on altruism across different subgroups of subjects or contexts. Another reason could be that there simply is no real effect and that previously reported single results are false positives. We explore the role of heterogeneity both by performing a mediator analysis of the meta-analytic effect and by conducting a new experiment designed to circumvent the issue of potential heterogeneity in the direction of the effect of promoting intuition. In both cases, we find little evidence that heterogeneity explains the absence of an overall effect of intuition on altruism. Taken together, our results offer little support for dual-system theories of altruistic behavior. © 2020, The Author(s).","Fromell, H.; Nosenzo, D.; Owens, T.",Exp. Econ.,2047

Ultimatums in two-person bargaining with one-sided uncertainty: Demand games,"The demand game is a noncooperative two-person ultimatum game with one-sided uncertainty in which the Sender knows the value of the shared surplus (pie) but the Receiver only knows its probability distribution (Mitzkewitz and Nagel, 1993). We study experimentally the effects of systematic changes in the variability of the pie distribution on the Sender's proposals and Receiver's (binary) responses. In accordance with a behavioral theory that we propose, we find that (i) the Sender's proportional share of the pie increases as the Receiver's uncertainty about the pie increases, and (ii) for a given pie distribution, the Sender's proportional share decreases as the actual pie size increases.","Rapoport, A.; Sundali, J.A.; Seale, D.A.",J.

Motivators of enrolment in HIV vaccine trials: a review of HIV vaccine preparedness studies,"HIV vaccine preparedness studies (VPS) are important precursors to HIV vaccine trials. As well, they contribute to an understanding of motivators and barriers for participation in hypothetical HIV vaccine trials. Motivators can take the form of altruism and a desire for social benefits. Perceived personal benefits, including psychological, personal, and financial well-being, may also motivate participation. The authors performed a systematic review of HIV VPS using the Cochrane Database for Systematic Reviews, Medline, PubMed, Embase, and Google Scholar. The authors independently searched the literature for individual HIV VPS that examined motivators of participation in a hypothetical HIV vaccine trial, using the same search strategy. As the denominators employed in the literature varied across studies, the denominators were standardized to the number of respondents per survey item, regardless of their willingness to participate (WTP) in an HIV vaccine trial. The authors retrieved eight studies on social benefits (i.e., altruism) and 11 studies on personal benefits conducted in the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, as well as 19 studies on social benefits and 20 studies on personal benefits in the non-OECD countries. Various different forms of altruism were found to be the major motivators for participation in an HIV vaccine trial in both the OECD and the non-OECD countries. In a large number of studies, protection from HIV was cited as a personal motivator for participation in a hypothetical HIV vaccine trial in the OECD and the non-OECD countries. Knowledge of motivators can inform and target recruitment for HIV vaccine trials, although it must be remembered that hypothetical motivators may not always translate into motivators in an actual vaccine trial.","Dhalla, Shayesta; Poole, Gary",AIDS Care,2050
Platinum-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy and interval surgical cytoreduction for advanced ovarian cancer: a meta-analysis,"Compared with primary cytoreduction, neoadjuvant chemotherapy is associated with reduced survival time in patients with advanced ovarian cancer. Findings indicate that definitive surgery should be performed early in the course of treatment. XCM: The review stated a clear research question and inclusion criteria for the participants, intervention and outcomes were defined. Limiting the search strategy to English language publications listed in one electronic database and reference lists of identified studies might have resulted in the omission of other relevant studies and increased the potential for publication and language bias. The methods used to select the studies and extract the data were not described, so it is not known whether any efforts were made to reduce reviewer error and bias.Simple linear regression appeared an appropriate method of exploring potential predictors of median survival. However, this method could not provide definitive answers to the review question. One limitation that the authors acknowledged was the lack of sufficient data for a multivariate analysis through which relationships between the various potential predictors of survival could be examined. In the conclusion the effect of neoadjuvant chemotherapy was compared with the effect of primary cytoreduction, but data were not provided in the review. In addition, the limited search and lack of reporting of review methods mean it is not possible to assess the reliability of these conclusions. XIM: Practice: The authors stated that findings suggest that definitive surgery should be performed early in the course of treatment.Research: The authors stated that additional studies on neoadjuvant chemotherapy are required to enable consistent identification of patients with surgically unresectable disease, and to determine the acceptable percentage of patients with advanced ovarian cancer that ought to be treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy in lieu of initial surgery.","Bristow R E, Chi D S",,2051
"The role of eyespots as anti-predator mechanisms, principally demonstrated in the Lepidoptera","Eyespots are found in a variety of animals, in particular lepidopterans. The role of eyespots as antipredator mechanisms has been discussed since the 19th Century, with two main hypotheses invoked to explain their occurrence. The first is that large, centrally located eyespots intimidate predators by resembling the eyes of the predators' own enemies; the second, though not necessarily conflicting, hypothesis is that small, peripherally located eyespots function as markers to deflect the attacks of predators to non-vital regions of the body. A third possibility is also proposed; that eyespots intimidate predators merely because they are novel or rarely encountered salient features. These hypotheses are reviewed, with special reference given to avian predators, since these are likely to be the principal visually hunting predators of the lepidopterans considered. Also highlighted is the necessity to consider the potential influence of sexual selection on lepidopteran wing patterns, and the genetics and development of eyespot formation. © 2005 Cambridge Philosophical Society.","Stevens, M.",Biol.

Social preferences under chronic stress,"Even though chronic stress is a pervasive problem in contemporary societies and is known to potentially precede both adverse psychological as well as physiological conditions, its effects on decision making have not been systematically investigated. In this paper, we focus on the relation between self-reported chronic stress and self-reported as well as behaviorally shown social preferences. We measured chronic stress with the Trier Inventory for Chronic Stress. To determine social preferences, participants played a double anonymous dictator game. In order to control for the robustness of social preferences we employed a 2x2x2x2 design where we manipulated four variables: the frame (Give to Recipient vs. Take from Recipient), the decision maker’s gender (Female vs. Male), the recipient’s gender (Female vs. Male), and the nature of the reward (Real vs. Hypothetical). Results show that perceived chronic stress is not significantly related to social preferences in monetarily rewarded dictator decisions for either gender. However, women’s displayed preferences for hypothetical rewards are negatively correlated to chronic stress levels. This indicates that higher chronic stress in women is associated with lower hypothetical transfers but not with altered actual behavior as compared to non-stressed women. For men, we do not observe such effects. Our findings suggest that, while chronic stress leaves social preferences unaffected in an incentive compatible task, it might foster what could be interpreted as a decrease in self-image promotion in women. Thus, we conclude that in a thoroughly controlled behavioral task differences in reported chronic stress do not entail differences in social preferences, but relate to variation in hypothetical decisions for women. © 2018 Ceccato et al.

Minimal social cues in the dictator game,"Giving to others is individually costly, yet generates benefits to the recipient. Such altruistic behavior has been well documented in experimental games between unrelated, anonymous individuals. Matters of social distance between giver and receiver, or between giver and a potential bystander, are also known to be relevant to giving behavior. This paper reports results of an experiment manipulating an extremely weak social cue in the dictator game. Prior to making their decision, we present dictators with a simple visual stimulus: either three dots in a ""watching-eyes"" configuration, or three dots in a neutral configuration. The watching-eyes configuration is suggestive of a schematic face - a stimuli that is known to weakly activate the fusiform face area of the brain. Our results demonstrate that such a weak social cue does increase giving behavior - even under a double-blind protocol - and this difference in behavior across treatments is entirely explained by differences in the dictator behavior of males. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

"Public subsidies and charitable giving: Crowding out, crowding in, or both?","Whether government subsidies to nonprofit organizations leverage (crowd in) private donations, or rather crowd them out has been actively debated for some time. A third hypothesis, explored theoretically and tested empirically in this paper, is that the two phenomena are actually not inconsistent with one another: At low levels of subsidies, government support may stimulate private giving whereas at high levels it could have just the opposite effect. The model presented is based on this idea, which yields implications relevant to nonprofit management and public policy, and tests it with data on symphony orchestras. The conclusion is that the maximization of private donations and total ""unearned"" revenues are not compatible goals. Further nonprofits that suffer from short-term liquidity problems or managerial short-sightedness may face a ""subsidy trap,"" in which they are forced to rely on suboptimal levels of subsidies in terms of maximizing the firm's revenues. © 2000 by the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management.","Brooks, A.C.",J.

Modifiable factors influencing relatives' decision to offer organ donation: systematic review,"Objective: To identify modifiable factors that influence relatives’ decision to allow organ donation. Design: Systematic review. Data sources Medline, Embase, and CINAHL, without language restriction, searched to April 2008. Review methods: Three authors independently assessed the eligibility of the identified studies. We excluded studies that examined only factors affecting consent that could not be altered, such as donor ethnicity. We extracted quantitative results to an electronic database. For data synthesis, we summarised the results of studies comparing similar themes. Results: We included 20 observational studies and audits. There were no randomised controlled trials. The main factors associated with reduced rates of refusal were the provision of adequate information on the process of organ donation and its benefits; high quality of care of potential organ donors; ensuring relatives had a clear understanding of brain stem death; separating the request for organ donation from notification that the patient had died; making the request in a private setting; and using trained and experienced individuals to make the request. Conclusions: Limited evidence suggests that there are modifiable factors in the process of requests for organ donation, in particular the skills of the individual making the request and the timing of this conversation, that might have a significant impact on rates of consent. Targeting these factors might have a greater and more immediate effect on the number of organs for donation than legislative or other long term strategies.

Government free riding in the public provision of higher education: Panel data estimates of possible crowding out,"This article employs panel data on more than 1000 US public colleges and universities to investigate the effect of private giving on state government funding. Government free riding is at question and is found to be active in that private donations partially displace state government funding at the rate of 83 cents on the dollar. That compares to the 45 cents political substitution of the 1960s but is much diminished from the $1.07 of the 1980s. Those are aggregate comparisons for all public institutions. A disaggregated approach in this article additionally reveals that doctoral granting research universities are somewhat lesser victims of crowd out in experiencing a 71 cents cut. At master level colleges and universities and associate 2 year degree granting colleges, crowding out is estimated to be on the order 87 cents and $1.10, respectively. Relative to the academic year 2000 to 2001, publicly controlled colleges and universities are found to experience significant reductions in state appropriated funding in 2003 to 2004 and 2006 to 2007. Even accounting for changes in the business cycle and changes in possible government spending priorities over time, the overall findings support the persistent effect of this brand of crowding out. © 2012 Taylor & Francis.","Thomas Sav, G.",Appl.

Mapping the Field of Donation-Based Crowdfunding for Charitable Causes: Systematic Review and Conceptual Framework,"This study compiles the main findings in the field of academic research on pure donation-based crowdfunding (DCF) soliciting monetary contributions for charitable causes. To this purpose, a systematic literature review is conducted, resulting in 92 scientific publications analyzed for the first time in this field of research. The prevailing thematic dimensions and research gaps are identified and discussed. The incipient literature on DCF, with a majority of publications from 2015 onward in the form of empirical articles using quantitative methodologies, focuses on antecedents related to individual donors, organizational promoters as main actors, and online channels and design-related features of campaigns as enablers. However, the effects of DCF on relevant stakeholders (particularly beneficiaries and society in general) remain largely obscure. Based on this analysis, an integrated conceptual framework on DCF is proposed to guide future research. This framework, susceptible of empirical evaluation, allows characterizing the DCF as a distinct and emerging type of philanthropic funding model based on specific and novel antecedents, actors, enablers and effects. © 2020, International Society for Third-Sector Research.","Salido-Andres, N.; Rey-Garcia, M.; Alvarez-Gonzalez, L.I.; Vazquez-Casielles, R.",Voluntas,2062
"The current landscape of US children’s television: violent, prosocial, educational, and fantastical content","The present study examined currently popular children’s television shows to determine the prevalence of violent, prosocial, educational, and fantastical content (including fantastical events and anthropomorphism). Network, style, and content ratings were collected for 88 shows using a combination of Common Sense Media and laboratory ratings applied to two randomly-selected episodes of each show. Overall, currently popular children’s television shows were most often animated and contained little violent, prosocial, or educational content, but a great deal of fantastical content. Interrelations among variables were also examined. Shows with fantastical events were both more violent and more prosocial than shows without, and shows with anthropomorphism were more prosocial than shows without. The network on which a show aired predicted violent, prosocial, and educational content, but not fantastical content. Children’s television today is not as violent as might be believed, but nor is it particularly prosocial or educational. It is highly fantastical. The implications of the landscape for children’s behavior, learning, and cognition are discussed. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Taggart, J.; Eisen, S.; Lillard, A.S.",J.

Donor-conceived people's views and experiences of their genetic origins: A crical analysis of the research evidence,"This article reports on a systematic review of English language, peer reviewed publications from 13 empirical studies with donor-conceived children and adults regarding their experiences and perceptions of donor conception. A total of 19 articles that met the inclusion criteria were reviewed. These were identified by means of a bibliographic search of four electronic databases for the period 1990-2011 and supplemented by the authors' personal knowledge of work in this field. No reports from such studies appeared prior to 2000, and more than half have been published since 2008, demonstrating the relative novelty of research in this field. Much of the reviewed research evidence concerns individuals conceived through sperm donation conducted under a regime promoting both anonymity and nondisclosure. Consequently, there is little research that pertains to individuals conceived through other forms of collaborative reproduction, nor to those conceived under arrangements and regimes in which early parental disclosure is both advocated and practised and the identity of the donor and of other genetic relatives may be accessible to donor-conceived individuals. The studies consistently report that most donor-conceived people have an interest in securing information about their genetic and biographical heritage more information than most of them have been able to obtain. Although a number of methodological limitations in the research base are identified, the authors conclude that the evidence is sufficiently robust to promote the implementation of policies and practices that promote transparency and openness in collaborative reproduction, thus reflecting the importance of maximising future choices and opportunities for donor-conceived people.","Blyth, Eric; Crawshaw, Marilyn; Frith, Lucy; Jones, Caroline",J.

Total disc replacement for chronic low back pain: background and a systematic review of the literature,"There were insufficient data on safety and efficacy to assess the performance of total disc replacement adequately. XCM: The review question was reasonably clear, as were the inclusion criteria. The search was adequate, although the authors suggested that the failure to search EMBASE may have limited the number of studies found. The authors acknowledged that the fact that the review was limited to studies published in peer-reviewed journals may have led to the introduction of publication bias, which was not assessed. The authors applied procedures to minimise bias and error when selecting studies for the review and in the validity assessment, which was thorough. However, they did not report using such methods when extracting data for the review.Details of the primary studies were presented adequately in tabular format, with the results of the quality assessment tabulated separately. The decision to adopt a narrative synthesis of the results was appropriate given the heterogeneity between the studies' measurement of the outcomes. However, the synthesis was primarily contained in the 'Discussion' section of the study and was difficult to relate to the evidence table. The authors' conclusions reflect the paucity of evidence found by the review. The implications for practice which they draw from these conclusions were appropriate.

Financial Rewards Do Not Stimulate Coproduction: Evidence from Two Experiments,"Western governments are increasingly trying to stimulate citizens to coproduce public services by, among other strategies, offering them financial incentives. However, there are competing views on whether financial incentives stimulate coproduction. While some argue that financial incentives increase citizens' willingness to coproduce, others suggest that incentives decrease their willingness (i.e., crowding out). To test these competing expectations, the authors designed a set of experiments that offered subjects a financial incentive to assist municipalities in helping refugees integrate. The experiment was first conducted among university students within a laboratory setting. Then, the initial findings were replicated and extended among a general adult sample. Results suggest that small financial rewards have no effect: they neither increase nor decrease people's willingness to coproduce. When the offered amount is increased substantially, willingness to coproduce increases only marginally. Hence, financial incentives are not a very cost-efficient instrument to stimulate coproduction. © 2018 The Authors.

Nonprofit branding: a bibliometric analysis,"Purpose: This study aims to examine articles on nonprofit branding over an 18-year time span to develop an overview and better understanding of the subject. Design/methodology/approach: This study used the Scopus database in a search for studies that deal, regardless of the approach, with branding in a nonprofit context. Subsequently, through a systematic review, a database with 84 articles was generated and 77 articles were submitted to bibliometric analysis. Findings: This study identified six main research areas (brand and donation, brand management, brand orientation, nonprofit and for-profit partnership, communication strategies and stakeholder management), which were analyzed and discussed, seeking to identify the relationship between research in each area. In addition, this study presents the limitations of the research and thus verify that, although this body of literature is growing, the complexity of the nonprofit sector offers several opportunities for future research, which are pointed out at the end of the study. Practical implications: This study contributes to the academic literature on the topic by providing a systematization of knowledge about branding in the nonprofit sector and also offers insights about nonprofit branding to institutions and managers in this industry.

The findings robustly demonstrate that in both countries, liberals respond more favorably to equality-based rewards, but conservatives respond more favorably to proportionality-based rewards. Study 1, conducted in the United States, finds that liberals perceive greater effectiveness in equality-based rewards based on random drawings, but conservatives perceive more effectiveness in proportionality-based rewards based on donation amounts. Study 2, conducted in Korea, shows that liberal (conservative) donors expect to be more (less) likely to receive rewards based on equality rather than proportionality. © 2018, American Marketing Association.","Lee, Y.; Yoon, S.; Lee, Y.W.; Royne, M.B.",J.

Not fair but acceptable… for us! Group membership influences the tradeoff between equality and utility in a Third Party Ultimatum Game,"A substantial body of literature on economic games (e.g., the Ultimatum Game) has consistently demonstrated that individuals strongly reject unfairness even at the price of personal utility. In four experiments we investigated the influence of social categorization and membership on economic decision-making and inequality aversion. Specifically, we used a modified version of the Third Party Ultimatum Game, in which participants played the role of responder and were instructed to make decisions for themselves or another individual (i.e. the receiver of the economic offer) who was an ingroup or outgroup member. Experiments 1-2 (N = 173) showed that the participants were more likely to accept unequal-advantageous offers when the receivers were ingroup rather than outgroup members. Experiment 3 (N = 121) supported previous findings and suggested the intervening role played by perceived intergroup competition. Experiment 4 (N = 61) explored the effect boundary conditions. Findings revealed that, even when responder's utility is linked to the receiver's utility, the receiver's membership exerted its influence when the responders were highly identified with the ingroup. A final small-scale meta-analysis confirmed the robustness of our findings. Taken together, these results integrate research on economic decision-making and intergroup bias and suggest that the utility target's membership can resolve the conflict between inequality aversion and utility maximization.","Biella, Marco; Sacchi, Simona",J.

Human aggression,"Research on human aggression has progressed a point at which a unifying framework is needed. Major domain-limited theories of aggression include cognitive neoassociation, social learning, social interaction, script, and excitation transfer theories. Using the general aggression model (GAM), this review posits cognition, affect, and arousal to mediate the effects of situational and personological variables on aggression. The review also organizes recent theories of the development and persistence of aggressive personality. Personality is conceptualized as a set of stable knowledge structures that individuals use to interpret events in their social world and to guide their behavior. In addition to organizing what is already known about human aggression, this review, using the GAM framework, also serves the heuristic function of suggesting what research is needed to fill in theoretical gaps and can be used to create and test interventions for reducing aggression.","Anderson, C.A.; Bushman, B.J.",Annu.

Field studies fail to verify this result. Several analysts argue that the problem lies with the specification of donor preferences. We report on a new experiment that provides a direct test of donor preferences free of the strategic factors that can confound tests in the field, and in other experimental settings. Our method involves the dictator game. We find extensive but incomplete crowding out - direct evidence that donor preferences are incorrectly specified by the standard model.","Bolton, G.E.; Katok, E.",J. Econ. Behav. Organ.,2075
The Effect of the Amount Reference in the Legitimizing Paltry Contribution Technique on Altruism,"Earlier research on the legitimizing paltry contribution (LPC) technique has found that the statement ""Even a penny will help..."" added to a request for charity donation increases compliance to the request. This study tested the effectiveness of the LPC technique with different statements. In bakeries, an opaque moneybox was placed near the cash register with a message explaining, on the first line, that the solicitation was for a humanitarian project for African children conducted by students. On the second line, the words ""Even a one centime coin will help..."" (amount LPC), ""Even the smallest coin will help..."" (no amount LPC), or no inscription (control no LPC) appeared. This second line was changed each day and for each bakery according to a random distribution. Results showed that more donations were made in the amount LPC condition compared to the two others, whereas the no amount LPC condition was different than the control no LPC condition. © 2013 Copyright Eastern Communication Association.","Guéguen, N.",Commun.

An Evolutionary Process Model of Cause-Related Marketing and Systematic Review of the Empirical Literature: AN EVOLUTIONARY PROCESS MODEL AND SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF CAUSE-RELATED MARKETING,"ABSTRACT Cause-related marketing (CRM) is almost ubiquitous as brands of all price points participate in this marketing strategy in the United States and internationally, as well. The value that CRM brings to the firm, the consumer, and the nonprofit organization has made it a popular and valuable tool for marketers. Academic research on CRM has gained momentum in recent years as the strategy has matured. However, insights have occurred without a framework to provide structure and direction for this body of research. Given CRM's continued popularity, the purpose of this article is to (1) propose an evolutionary process model (EPM) of CRM to explain the iterative process (2) utilize this model as a framework for (a) organizing the systematic review of the empirical literature on CRM and (b) for identifying some gaps in the literature. Propositions based on these gaps are provided for future research.","Lafferty, Barbara A; Lueth, Annika K; McCafferty, Ryan",Psychol. Mark.,2077
Errors-in-Variables and Estimated Income and Price Elasticities of Charitable Giving,"Researchers often rely on self-reported tax data to gauge the effect of taxes on economic activity. These data, however, are subject to measurement errors in the presence of tax evasion. We find evidence that estimated income and tax price elasticities are biased due to errors-in-variables in self-reported tax data. We propose a method to diagnose whether the estimates are subject to measurement error bias and describe a methodology employing Two-Stage Least Squares to obtain consistent estimates.","Joulfaian, D.; Rider, M.",Natl.

Do lab experiments misrepresent social preferences? The case of self-selected student samples,"Social preference research has received considerable attention among economists in recent years. However, the empirical foundation of social preferences is largely based on laboratory experiments with self-selected students as participants. This is potentially problematic as students participating in experiments may behave systematically different than nonparticipating students or nonstudents. In this paper we empirically investigate whether laboratory experiments with student samples misrepresent the importance of social preferences. Our first study shows that students who exhibit stronger prosocial inclinations in an unrelated field donation are not more likely to participate in experiments. This suggests that self-selection of more prosocial students into experiments is not a major issue. Our second study compares the behavior of students and participants recruited from the general population in a trust experiment. In general, we find very similar behavioral patterns for the two groups, but nonstudents make significantly more generous repayments suggesting that results from student samples might be seen as a lower bound for the importance of prosocial behavior. © 2013 by the European Economic Association.","Falk, A.; Meier, S.; Zehnder, C.",J.

A latent growth curve analysis of prosocial behavior among rural adolescents,"The present study was designed to investigate stability and changes in prosocial behavior and the parent and peer correlates of prosocial behavior in rural adolescents. Participants were from a rural, low SES community in the Eastern United States. The participants were in 7th, 8th, and 9th grades at Time 1 and 10th, 11th, and 12th grades at Time 4, and completed measures of prosocial behavior and quality of parent and peer relationships. Latent growth curve modeling revealed that despite moderate stability in individual differences in prosocial behavior and slight increases in quality of peer and parent relationships, level of prosocial behavior declined until late high school with a slight rebound in grade 12. Furthermore, increases in the quality of peer relationships predicted decreases in prosocial behavior for girls but not boys. Discussion focuses on continuity and change in prosocial behavior and the gender-based relations between quality of parent and peer relationships and prosocial behaviors in adolescence. © Copyright © 2007, Society for Research on Adolescence.","Carlo, G.; Crockett, L.J.; Randall, B.A.; Roesch, S.C.",J.

Reassessing the tax-favored status of the charitable deduction for gifts of appreciated assets,"This paper analyzes the tax-favored status of charitable donations of appreciated assets using data from the 1985 Statistics of Income individual tax file. The efficiency of favored tax treatment of charitable donations is analyzed by estimating separate price elasticities for total, cash, and property contributions. The results indicate that wealthy donors (those whose positive income exceeds $200,000) are responsive to the tax-favored status of charitable donations of appreciated property, while taxpayers who are not considered wealthy are price inelastic. These findings indicate that the tax-favored status of property donations made by other than wealthy taxpayers should be reassessed.","O'Neil, C.J.; Steinberg, R.S.; Thompson, G.R.",Natl. Tax J.,2083

Considering situational and dispositional approaches to rational self-interest: An extension and response to de Dreu (2006),"The authors respond to C. K. W. De Dreu's (2006; see record 2006-20695-004) critique of their article (B. M. Meglino & M. A.

They maintain that De Dreu misinterprets their definitions and the psychological processes they addressed and thus raises a number of issues that are not relevant to their model. Meglino and Korsgaard's model focuses on the distinction between rational self-interest and other orientation, whereas the approach taken by De Dreu focuses on the distinction between rational self-interest and collective rationality. In this response, the authors clarify this distinction, address discrepancies between these two approaches, consider the effect of goals and rationality on other orientated behavior, and suggest directions for future research.

Congruence Between the Target in Need and the Recipient of Aid: The One-Among-Others Effect,"We tested the hypothesis that people are more likely to offer aid when the beneficiary of help is congruent with the entity that initiates prosocial action. In 2 experiments conducted in 2 different countries, participants were approached in naturalistic settings with an appeal for help. The target in need (individual vs. individual among others with the same need) and the beneficiary of potential help (individual vs. group) were manipulated. Results revealed that participants were more likely to offer aid when the target in need and beneficiary of help were congruent.

Anthocyanin Consumption and Risk of Colorectal Cancer: A Meta-Analysis of Observational Studies,"This meta-analysis aimed to summarize the association between anthocyanin consumption and the risk of colorectal cancer. All relative articles were located on online databases, including PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library as of June 11, 2018. Risk ratios (RRs) or odds ratio and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated through the STATA 12.0 software package. A total of seven studies were included in the meta-analysis. A significant inverse association was found between total anthocyanin consumption and colorectal cancer risk (RR = 0.78; 95% CI, 0.64-0.95). Likewise, there was significant evidence of a relationship between anthocyanin intake and colorectal cancer in the colon site (RR = 0.81; 95% CI, 0.71-0.92); men (RR = 0.88; 95% CI, 0.81-0.95), and case-control studies (RR = 0.69; 95% CI, 0.60-0.78). A dose-response relationship was not found in this meta-analysis. The Grades of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation quality in our study was very low. This meta-analysis indicates that anthocyanin consumption is inversely associated with the risk of colorectal cancer. Anthocyanins may play an active role in the prevention of colorectal cancer. Key teaching points: Some epidemiological studies found an inverse correlation between the high consumption of anthocyanins and low risk of colorectal cancer. Because of this structure, anthocyanins/anthocyanidins have a powerful capability of donating electrons, which can be characterized as antioxidant properties. Anthocyanins can also inhibit colon cancer by interfering in the cell cycle and inducing the effect of anti-proliferation and apoptosis. The formation of cytoplasmic vacuoles in cells also indicates that anthocyanins may induce autophagy. From the findings of nonrandomized controlled trials, anthocyanins may play an active role in the prevention of colorectal cancer.","Wang, Xin; Yang, De-Yi; Yang, Liu-Qing; Zhao, Wen-Zhi; Cai, Li-Ya; Shi, Han-Ping",J.

The impact of prosocial television news on children’s prosocial behavior: An experimental study in the Netherlands,"The aim of this experimental study was to examine whether prosocial behavior in television news affects children’s prosocial intentions and behaviors. In this study, 372 Dutch children (9–13 years old) participated. Children in the experimental condition were exposed to prosocial news showing children organizing a fundraising action for UNICEF. In the control condition, children were exposed to news about UNICEF in which no prosocial behavior was included. Afterwards, children were given the opportunity to donate to UNICEF, which served as an index of prosocial behavior. Prosocial intentions were captured using paper-and-pencil questionnaires. Regression analysis demonstrated that, while controlling for important confounders, children exposed to prosocial news were significantly more willing to help with setting up a project for UNICEF and donated more to UNICEF compared to children who did not watch prosocial news. These findings highlight that prosocial television can function as a tool for positive social change among children. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","de Leeuw, R.N.H.; Kleemans, M.; Rozendaal, E.; Anschütz, D.J.; Buijzen, M.",J.

The use of passive visual stimuli to enhance compliance with handwashing in a perioperative setting,"Background To encourage handwashing, we analyzed the effect that a passive visual stimulus in the form of a picture of a set of eyes had on self-directed hand hygiene among health care staff. Methods This was a prospective, single-blind study using a repeated measure design. Four dispensers of alcohol foam located in positions identified as #1, #2, #3, and #4 were used to deliver a single uniform volume of alcohol foam in an automated fashion. Pictures of eyes were placed on dispensers #1 and #3 but not dispensers #2 and #4 for 1 time period. The visual stimulus was rotated with each study time period. At the end of each study period, the volumes dispensed were examined to determine if the visual stimulus had a statistically significant influence on the volume dispensed. Results There were a total of 6 time periods. The average volume dispensed in stations with eyes was 279 cc versus that in the stations without eyes, which was 246 cc, and this was a statistically significant difference (P =.009). Conclusion The correct visual stimuli may enhance compliance with hand hygiene in health care settings. © 2016 Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology, Inc.

An evolutionary account of vigilance in grief,"Grief is characterized by a number of cardinal cognitive symptoms, including preoccupation with thoughts of the deceased and vigilance toward indications that the deceased is in the environment. Compared with emotional symptoms, little attention has been paid to the ultimate function of vigilance in grief. Drawing on signal-detection theory, we propose that the ultimate function of vigilance is to facilitate the reunification (where possible) with a viable relationship partner following separation. Preoccupation with thoughts about the missing person creates the cognitive conditions necessary to maintain a low baseline threshold for the detection of the agent-any information associated with the agent is highly salient, and attention is correspondingly readily deployed toward such cues. These patterns are adaptive in cases of an absent but living partner, but maladaptive in cases of the death of a partner. That they occur in the latter likely reflects the intersection of error-management considerations and the kludge-like configuration of the mind. We discuss results from two previous studies designed to test predictions concerning input conditions and individual differences based on this account, and consider the implications of these findings for mainstream bereavement theories and practices. © The Author(s) 2018.

Altruistic and joy-of-giving motivations in charitable behavior,"This study theoretically and empirically examines altruistic and joy-of-giving motivations underlying contributions to charitable activities. The theoretical analysis shows that in an economy with an infinitely large number of donors, impurely altruistic preferences lead to either asymptotically zero or complete crowd-out. The paper then establishes conditions on preferences that are sufficient to yield zero crowd-out in the limit. These conditions are fairly weak and quite plausible. An empirical representation of the model is estimated using a new 1986-92 panel of donations and government funding from the United States to 125 international relief and development organizations. Besides directly linking sources of public and private support, the econometric analysis controls for unobserved institution-specific factors, institution-specific changes in leadership, year-to-year changes in need, and expenditures by related organizations. The estimates show little evidence of crowd-out from either direct public or related private sources. Thus, at the margin, donations to these organizations appear to be motivated solely by joy-of-giving preferences. In addition to addressing the basic question of motives behind charitable giving, the results help explain the existing disparity between econometric and experimental crowd-out estimates.","Ribar, D.C.; Wilhelm, M.O.",J.

The impact of increased duration of exercise therapy on functional recovery following stroke: what is the evidence?,"The authors concluded that increased duration of exercise therapy, when compared to standard exercise regimes, improved functional outcome, as measured by the Barthel Index, in patients with stroke both post-treatment and at six months follow-up. They also indicated that their findings supported a positive effect on lower extremity impairment and walking speed. XCM: This review had a clear aim and inclusion criteria and adequate details of studies included were provided. The literature search covered several databases but no attempt was made to uncover unpublished or non-English language studies, leaving the review open to possible publication and language bias. Only one reviewer assessed the references for retrieval, but full papers were screened by two reviewers, limiting possible reviewer bias. Quality assessment was performed independently by two reviewers, but it was not clear whether data extraction was performed in the same way. A relatively thorough quality assessment appeared to have been performed, although details of the process and criteria used to assess studies for the PEDro database would have added to this. The choice of statistical synthesis and method used was appropriate. Only results for trials reporting the same outcome measure were pooled, but given that results using different scales were converted to standardised mean differences, results could have been pooled across scales giving the analyses greater power, although this might have been at the expense of meaningful results if the scales were not assessing sufficiently similar outcomes. No details of the heterogeneity assessment were provided and no graphical presentation of trial results was given to allow the reader to assess the similarity of included trials. This was a reasonable well-conducted review and the authors' conclusions with respect to functional outcome are an accurate and reliable reflection of the results of the review, although the authors did not indicate that the actual observed effect was small in magnitude. The conclusions relating to lower extremity impairment and walking speed are not based on the results of the review and cannot be regarded as reliable. XIM: Practice: The authors did not state any implications for practice. Research: The authors stated that further research work is required to establish what particular type of patient gains optimum benefit from additional exercise therapy post-stroke, and on the number of minutes of additional exercise therapy that is needed to demonstrate a significant effect. Research should focus on novel ways of delivering increased exercise, perhaps in the form of family-mediated exercise therapy, in addition to methods to motivate ongoing participation in these programs.","Galvin, R; Murphy, B; Cusack, T; Stokes, E",,2094
Massage therapy for the treatment of depression: a systematic review,"BACKGROUND: People with depressive disorders or subsyndromal symptoms of depression (SSD) often use complementary and alternative therapies, including massage therapy (MT). This systematic review evaluates the evidence, from randomised clinical trials (RCTs), for the effectiveness of multiple sessions of classical European (Swedish) MT for the treatment of depression. METHODS: Eligible RCTs were identified via eight electronic databases and manual searches of references. Two reviewers independently selected trials, assessed trial quality and extracted data. RESULTS: Four RCTs met our inclusion criteria. Three of these RCTs compared MT with relaxation therapies, but provided insufficient data and analyses to contribute meaningfully to the evaluation of MT for depression. The fourth included RCT used MT as a control condition to evaluate a depression-specific acupuncture treatment. This trial provided limited evidence that, in the early stages of treatment, MT is less effective than acupuncture for treating depression, a treatment which itself is not accepted for this condition. CONCLUSIONS: Despite previous research suggesting that MT may be an effective treatment for depression, there is currently a lack of evidence to support this assertion from RCTs that have selected participants for depression or SSD.","Coelho, H F; Boddy, K; Ernst, E",Int.

"Private Donations, Government Grants, Commercial Activities, and Fundraising: Cointegration and Causality for NGOs in International Development Cooperation","NGOs could help scale up foreign aid efforts by mobilizing private donations. However, fundraising activities do not necessarily result in higher donations, and substitution effects between different sources of revenue may diminish the overall pool of NGOs' resources. This paper examines the long-run determinants of private donations to US-based NGOs engaged in international development cooperation using panel cointegration techniques. According to our results, a marginal dollar spent on fundraising yields almost five dollars in new donations in the long-run.

Testing the Effectiveness of Fundraiser Job Titles in Charitable Bequest and Complex Gift Planning,"Traditional fundraiser job titles are often institution centered, focusing on the benefits of fundraising as “institutional advancement” or “institutional development.” Such institution-centered job titles may not be as effective with donors given the modern shift toward donor-centered philanthropy. Alternative job titles can be gift centered (for example, “major gifts”) or donor centered (for example, “donor advising”). A survey of 3,188 respondents tested sixty-three job titles in four charitable scenarios: a charitable bequest gift, a gift of stock, a gift of real estate, and a charitable gift annuity. Measured by which person donors would be more likely to contact to discuss each donation, the worst-performing titles were the traditional institution-focused fundraiser job titles, in particular those using “advancement,” “institutional advancement,” or “development.” This was also true when examining only respondents who had made large gifts ($500+) to a charity. Traditional institution-focused job titles are both the most commonly used and the worst performing. Nonprofit managers may do well to consider the donor's perspective when selecting job titles for fundraisers rather than following traditional industry practices. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","James, R.N., III",Nonprofit Manage.

Gene therapy as a novel therapeutic option in the treatment of peripheral vascular disease: systematic review and meta-analysis,"The available data suggested that gene therapy conferred no benefits in PWT, COT, or ABPI for patients with peripheral vascular disease. These results could be explained by excessive placebo response rates. XCM: The review question and trial eligibility criteria were clear. Relevant databases were searched and publication bias was assessed and no evidence found. It was unclear whether language restrictions were applied. The methods used to minimise reviewer bias and errors were incompletely reported. Quality assessment was performed using an appropriate scale and most of the trials were of high quality. The decision to combine trial results statistically was appropriate given the absence of statistical heterogeneity. Statistical data were reported for all the outcomes, but limited outcome data were reported for individual trials. Only a small number of trials were included and they had small samples that were insufficient to detect small treatment differences.The conclusions reflected the evidence presented, but their reliability is unclear given the potential for reviewer errors and bias and the small number of trials and participants considered. XIM: Practice: The authors did not state any implications for practice.Research: The authors stated that trials were needed to clarify the role of gene therapy for patients with peripheral vascular disease, particularly limb ischaemia. These trials should assess the effectiveness of gene delivery methods (intramuscular or intra-arterial) on PWTs in patients with peripheral vascular disease. They should also investigate the reasons for excessive placebo response rates, particularly on treadmill tests, using more objective methods of measurement, such as digital subtraction angiography.","Ghosh, R; Walsh, S R; Tang, T Y; Noorani, A; Hayes, P D",,2098

Ultimatum decision-making: A test of reciprocal kindness,"While fairness is often mentioned as a determinant of ultimatum bargaining behavior, few data sets are available that can test theories that incorporate fairness considerations. This paper tests the reciprocal kindness theory in Rabin (1993 Incorporating fairness into game theory and economics, The American Economic Review 83: 1281-1302) as an application to the one-period ultimatum bargaining game. We report on data from 100 ultimatum games that vary the financial stakes of the game from $1 to $15. Responder behavior is strongly in support of the kindness theory and proposer behavior weakly in support of it. Offer percentages and past offers influence behavior the most, whereas the size of the pie has a marginally significant effect on offer percentages. The data is more in support of reciprocal kindness than alternative theories of equal-split or learning behavior, although the data also weakly support a minimum percentage threshold hypothesis. As a whole, our results together with existing studies suggest that, for smaller stakes games, fairness considerations dominate monetary considerations. This has implications for more complicated naturally occurring bargaining environments in which the financial stakes can vary widely.","Dickinson, D.L.",Theory Decis,2100

Public-private differences in incentive structures: a laboratory experiment on work motivation and performance,"In this study, we contribute to a longstanding research agenda on the distinctions between the public and private sectors by examining whether work effort differs between public and private settings, and by testing the ways that sector-specific incentives can address such differences. We extend existing research by developing an advanced psychomotor vigilance task that examines multi-dimensional performance (speed and accuracy) in a laboratory experiment. Drawing from a population that is similar along many dimensions, subjects are recruited into public and private settings on the basis of their motivation (majors they have chosen to study and the types of compensation they receive). Using a two-by-two factorial design of public (public job motivated and non-monetary motivated) and private (monetary-motivated) settings, with and without incentives, our findings indicate that public and private settings differ in performance and response to incentives. Methodologically, we show how the choices that experimental subjects make can be exploited for modeling sectoral differences in a more naturalistic way than with a short-term prime, while preserving the advantages of a controlled laboratory experiment. © 2021 The Author(s).

No evidence that a range of artificial monitoring cues influence online donations to charity in an MTurk sample,"Monitoring cues, such as an image of a face or pair of eyes, have been found to increase prosocial behaviour in several studies. However, other studies have found little or no support for this effect. Here, we examined whether monitoring cues affect online donations to charity while manipulating the emotion displayed, the number of watchers and the cue type. We also include as statistical controls a range of likely covariates of prosocial behaviour. Using the crowdsourcing Internet marketplace, AmazonMechanical Turk (MTurk), 1535 participants completed our survey and were given the opportunity to donate to charity while being shown an image prime. None of the monitoring primes we tested had a significant effect on charitable giving. By contrast, the control variables of culture, age, sex and previous charity giving frequency did predict donations. This work supports the importance of cultural differences and enduring individual differences in prosocial behaviour and shows that a range of artificial monitoring cues do not reliably boost online charity donation on MTurk. © 2016 The Authors.","Saunders, T.J.; Taylor, A.H.; Atkinson, Q.D.",R.

Computer Monitoring of Work Performance: Extending the Social Facilitation Framework to Electronic Presence,"This study demonstrated the utility of employing a social facilitation framework to the study of computer monitoring of work performance. The physical presence of an observer watching a subject work on a complex task (as a supervisor might “look over an employee's shoulder“) was contrasted with four conditions involving the electronic presence of computer‐based work monitoring (as a supervisor might monitor an employee's work remotely via computer) and a control condition of subjects working alone without any monitoring of their work. Task performance was severely impaired for participants who were monitored electronically as well as for those who were monitored “in person.” Two interventions, providing participants with a sense of control over their work conditions and monitoring participants as a group rather than as individuals, each reduced the negative impact of monitoring on task performance by almost 40%. Results also indicated that individuals with an external locus of control (who believe reinforcements received are primarily determined by factors outside of themselves, e. g., other people) experience greater anxiety than those with an internal locus of control under monitoring conditions. Implications of these findings for social facilitation and the rapidly expanding use of computer‐based work monitoring are discussed. Copyright © 1993, Wiley Blackwell.

Supplementation of infant formula with long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids does not influence the growth of term infants,"BACKGROUND: Adequate growth is an important indicator of health and well-being in infants. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to determine the effect of supplementing infant formula with long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs) on the growth of term infants. DESIGN: Using the methodology outlined by the Cochrane Collaboration, we reviewed all known randomized controlled trials that involved LCPUFA supplementation of infant formula fed to term infants. Outcome measures were weight, length, and head circumference. Original data obtained from the investigators of published trials were used. Outcomes were analyzed with fixed-effects or random-effects model meta-analyses and were reported as weighted mean differences with 95% CIs. RESULTS: We identified 14 eligible trials that had data available for meta-analysis (1846 infants). Trial quality was generally high. Meta-analysis showed no significant effect of LCPUFA supplementation on infant weight, length, or head circumference at any assessment age. Similarly, subgroup analyses showed that supplementation with only n-3 LCPUFAs (no arachidonic acid) had no significant effect on infant weight, length, or head circumference. The source of LCPUFA supplementation (phospholipid or triacylglycerol) also did not significantly affect infant growth. CONCLUSION: We found no evidence that LCPUFA supplementation of infant formula influences the growth of term infants in either a positive or a negative way.","Makrides, Maria; Gibson, Robert A; Udell, Tuesday; Ried, Karin; International LCPUFA Investigators",Am.

Project financing models for toll road investments: A state-of-the-art literature review,"t In greenfield toll-road projects, financial sustainability has been a major issue. Many toll roads cannot be operated. Although most of Indonesia’s 24 toll road concessions have already been signed by the Toll Road Authority, most of them were caused by financing problems. Three problems have been identified as potential sources of this unsustainability, such as the uncertainty of long-term project revenues, budget constraints provided by the government, and inadequate government support for land acquisitions. This paper aims to investigate the state-of-the-art innovative financing models recently introduced to address financial problems by using a desk study and meta-analysis. The findings are an earmarked tax revenue system, deep discount bonds, take-out financing, tax increment financing, land leases, deferred debts, and private donations. ©2018 by authors, all rights reserved.","Sihombing, L B; Latief, Y; Rarasati, A D; Wibowo, A",Harbin Jianzhu Daxue Xuebao/J.

Priority setting and policy advocacy by nursing associations: a scoping review and implications using a socio-ecological whole systems lens,"OBJECTIVE: We undertook an interpretative scoping review to examine organizational priority setting and policy advocacy and the factors that influence nursing associations' cross-sector public policy choices and actions. METHOD: Evidence was drawn from research, narrative, and theoretical sources that described priority setting and policy advocacy undertaken by non-governmental, non-profit, and nursing associations. Text was extracted from selected papers, imported into NVivo 8, coded, and analyzed using a descriptive-analytical narrative method. RESULTS: Many internal and external factors are shown to shape organizations' policy choices and actions including governance and governance structures, membership arrangements, legislative, professional, and jurisdictional mandates, perceived credibility, and external system disruptions. CONCLUSIONS: Internal and external factors are identified in the literature as critical to how organizations succeed or fail to set achievable priorities and advance their advocacy goals. Case comparisons and longitudinal research are needed to understand nursing associations' policy choices and actions for cross-sector public policy given their complex organizational structures and dynamic professional-legal-social-economic-political-ecological environments. A socio-ecological systems perspective can inform the development of theoretical frameworks and research to understand leverage points and blockages to guide nursing associations' public policy choices and actions at varying points in time.","MacDonald, Jo-Anne; Edwards, Nancy; Davies, Barbara; Marck, Patricia; Guernsey, Judith Read",Health Policy,2110
The claiming effect: Why players are more generous in social dilemmas than in ultimatum games,"The term procedural frames is introduced and defined as different representations of structurally equivalent allocation processes. Study 1 compared 2 well-known games, sequential social dilemmas and ultimatum bargaining, that share the same structure: Player 1 creates an allocation of a resource and Player 2 decides whether to allow it or deny it. Study 1 found that Player 1 made more favorable allocations and Player 2 accepted more unfavorable allocations in a social dilemma frame than in an equivalent ultimatum bargaining frame. Study 2 revealed the critical determinant was whether Player 2 had to respond to an allocation by accepting or rejecting it (as in the ultimatum game) or by making a claim (as in the social dilemma). Two additional studies explored how these actions are perceived. The inconsistency of behavior across procedural frames raises methodological concerns but illuminates construal processes that guide allocation.

Conceptual overlap between moral norms and anticipated regret in the prediction of intention: implications for theory of planned behaviour research,"Moral norms and anticipated regret are widely used extensions to the theory of planned behaviour, yet there is some evidence to suggest that these constructs may conceptually overlap as predictors of intention. Two health-related behaviours with distinct moral implications (Study 1: organ donation registration, N = 352 and Study 2: condom usage, N = 1815) were therefore examined to ascertain whether moral norms and anticipated regret are indeed conceptually distinct. While evidence consistent with conceptual overlap was identified in Study 1, the evidence for such overlap in Study 2 was more ambiguous. In Study 3, a meta-analysis of existing literature revealed that the relationship between moral norms and anticipated regret was moderated by the extent of the moral implications arising from the behaviour under examination. Taken together, these findings suggest that conceptual overlap between moral norms and anticipated regret is more likely to occur among behaviours with obvious moral implications. Researchers wishing to examine the predictive utility of moral norms and anticipated regret among such behaviours would therefore be advised to aggregate these measures to form a composite variable (personal norms).","Newton, Joshua D; Newton, Fiona J; Ewing, Michael T; Burney, Sue; Hay, Margaret",Psychol.

Effectiveness and tolerability of combination treatment of chronic hepatitis C in illicit drug users: meta-analysis of prospective studies,"Using antiviral combinations to treat chronic hepatitis C was as efficacious and well tolerated in illicit drug users as in the general population. XCM: Inclusion criteria for the review were clearly defined and several relevant data sources were searched. The restriction to studies in English risked language bias (the authors considered the actual risk to be low). Publication bias was detected. Attempts were made to reduce reviewer error and bias throughout the review process. Quality assessment indicated that the quality of the studies was variable and most were deemed poor quality. The studies varied considerably in patient characteristics, interventions and study types, which the authors acknowledged. Several studies had small sample sizes. Trials were combined using standard statistical methods. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed and found to be significant for most outcomes, so the studies may not have been suitable for pooling. The studies of non-illicit drug users were not part of the systematic review and were not adequately described and so use of these results as a comparison may not have been appropriate. Differences between the studies, small sample sizes, methodological quality issues and potential for publication bias limits the reliability of the pooled results and caution appears warranted when interpreting the conclusions. XIM: Practice: The authors did not state any implications for practice.Research: The authors stated that larger prospective trials were needed to determine the most effective antiviral treatment regimens for hepatitis C virus infection in illicit drug users. The choice of opiate-substitution treatment to be associated with antiviral agents needed to be determined.","Zanini, B; Covolo, L; Donato, F; Lanzini, A",,2113

Cost-effectiveness of syringe exchange as an HIV prevention strategy,"OBJECTIVE: To analyze the cost-effectiveness of New York State-approved syringe exchange programs (SEPs) and estimate the cost-saving potential of these programs. DESIGN AND METHODS: The cost-effectiveness analysis used cost and process data provided by seven SEPs for the calendar year 1996 or the most recent 12-month period available at the time of the study. Alternative estimates of the number of HIV infections prevented were calculated using published data and a simplified circulation model. HIV treatment costs were taken from the literature. RESULTS: A cost-effectiveness ratio of $20,947 per HIV infection averted was calculated based on an estimated 87 HIV infections averted across the seven programs and total program costs of $1.82 million (all amounts given in US dollars). Sensitivity analyses were also performed. Using imputed costs for donated services and estimates of lifetime costs to treat an HIV infection, syringe exchange was demonstrated to be a cost-saving strategy from a societal perspective. CONCLUSIONS: This research demonstrates that syringe exchange is a cost-effective and cost-saving strategy for reducing HIV transmission.","Laufer, F N",J. Acquir. Immune Defic. Syndr.,2116

Ultimatums in two-person bargaining with one-sided uncertainty: Offer games,"In the ultimatum game with complete information a Sender proposes a division of a given amount of surplus (""pie""), which a Receiver can either accept (payoffs are distributed according to the Sender's proposal) or reject (both players earn nothing). We study another version of the ultimatum game under incomplete informaton in which the pie is drawn randomly from a commonly known distribution, the Sender knows the exact size of the pie, but the Receiver only knows her share of the pie, not the residual share requested by the Sender. The basic results are that (1) as the support of the pie distribution increases in a mean-preserving spread, the Senders make lower offers that the Receivers are less likely to reject, (2) for a given support, Senders tend to offer a lower proportion of the pie to the Receivers as the pie size grows larger, and (3) although knowing only their share of the pie, Receivers estimate its size quite accurately.","Rapoport, A.; Sundali, J.A.",Int.

A comparative fMRI meta-analysis of altruistic and strategic decisions to give,"The decision to share resources is fundamental for cohesive societies. Humans can be motivated to give for many reasons. Some generosity incurs a definite cost, with no extrinsic reward to the act, but instead provides intrinsic satisfaction (labelled here as 'altruistic' giving). Other giving behaviours are done with the prospect of improving one's own situation via reciprocity, reputation, or public good (labelled here as 'strategic' giving). These contexts differ in the source, certainty, and timing of rewards as well as the inferences made about others' mental states. We executed a combined statistical map and coordinate-based fMRI meta-analysis of decisions to give (36 studies, 1150 participants). Methods included a novel approach for accommodating variable signal dropout between studies in meta-analysis. Results reveal consistent, cross-paradigm neural correlates of each decision type, commonalities, and informative differences. Relative to being selfish, altruistic and strategic giving activate overlapping reward networks. However, strategic decisions showed greater activity in striatal regions than altruistic choices. Altruistic giving, more than strategic, activated subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC). Ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) is consistently involved during generous decisions and processing across a posterior to anterior axis differentiates the altruistic/strategic context. Posterior vmPFC was preferentially recruited during altruistic decisions. Regions of the 'social brain' showed distinct patterns of activity between choice types, reflecting the different use of theory of mind in the two contexts. We provide the consistent neural correlates of decisions to give, and show that many will depend on the source of incentives.","Cutler, Jo; Campbell-Meiklejohn, Daniel",Neuroimage,2120

"Four worlds of welfare state attitudes? A comparison of Germany, Norway, and the United States","This article examines the determinants of variations in welfare state attitudes between Germany, Norway, and the United States. Besides the influence of different 'welfare regime types' as discussed by Esping-Andersen and others, compositional effects of individual variables measuring people's socio-economic interests and socialization experiences and the interaction of aggregate-level (welfare regime) and individual-level (individual variables) determinants of welfare state attitudes are considered. Using data from the International Social Survey Programme (ISSP), results of our analysis show that remarkable between-country differences in welfare state attitudes exist. Our results suggest that these differences have to be explained both in terms of overall country effects and of the influence of country-specific economic interests and socialization experiences.","Andreß, H.-J.; Heien, T.",Eur.

Journal of Political Economy, 97, 1197-1207) widely cited study of charitable contributions to public radio. Kingma's estimate of partial, but statistically significant crowd-out remains a benchmark in the literature because he was able to match household-level contributions data with station-level data on revenue, including revenue from government grants. To the best of our knowledge, no comparable data have become available until now. We replicate Kingma's estimates with the original data and then apply the same methodology to very similar data from 1996.

Item and confirmatory factor analyses in both studies corroborate the theoretical model of social well-being. The new scales correlate convergently with measures of anomie, generativity, perceived social constraints, community involvement and neighborhood quality. The new scales correlate discriminantly with measures of dysphoria, global well-being, physical health and optimism. Multivariate analyses in both studies substantiate the claim that social well-being is an achievement, facilitated by educational attainment and age.

Increasing Compliance by Improving the Deal. The That's-Not-All Technique,"Seven experiments were conducted to demonstrate and explain the effectiveness of a compliance procedure dubbed the ""that's-not-all"" technique. The procedure consists of offering a product at a high price, not allowing the customer to respond for a few seconds, then offering a better deal by either adding another product or lowering the price. Experiments 1 and 2 demonstrated the effectiveness of this procedure over a control group that was given the better deal initially. The results of Experiments 3 and 4 suggested that this effectiveness may be partially explained through a norm of reciprocity that calls for the customer to respond to the seller's new offer. Experiment 5 results suggest that the effect also results from an altering of the anchor point subjects use to judge the new price. Experiment 6 results indicate the effectiveness of the procedure cannot be explained as the subject perceiving the lower price as a bargain. Finally, Experiment 7 examined the differences between the that's-not-all and the ""door-in-the-face"" procedures. © 1986 American Psychological Association.","Burger, J.M.",J. Pers. Soc.

"Who Takes the Floor and Why: Gender, Power, and Volubility in Organizations","Although past research has noted the importance of both power and gender for understanding volubility-the total amount of time spent talking-in organizations, to date, identifying the unique contributions of power and gender to volubility has been somewhat elusive. Using both naturalistic data sets and experiments, the present studies indicate that while power has a strong, positive effect on volubility for men, no such effect exists for women. Study 1 uses archival data to examine the relationship between the relative power of United States senators and their talking behavior on the Senate floor. Results indicate a strong positive relationship between power and volubility for male senators, but a non-significant relationship for female senators. Study 2 replicates this effect in an experimental setting by priming the concept of power and shows that though men primed with power talk more, women show no effect of power on volubility. Mediation analyses indicate that this difference is explained by women's concern that being highly voluble will result in negative consequences (i.e., backlash). Study 3 shows that powerful women are in fact correct in assuming that they will incur backlash as a result of talking more than others-an effect that is observed among both male and female perceivers. Implications for the literatures on volubility, power, and previous studies of backlash are discussed. © The Author(s) 2011.","Brescoll, V.L.",Adm. Sci. Q.,2131

"The differential impact of statistical and narrative evidence on beliefs, attitude, and intention: a meta-analysis","Although ""evidence"" is often used as an important argument in persuasive health campaigns, it remains unclear what type of evidence has the strongest impact on particular outcome variables. We conducted a meta-analysis in which the effects of statistical and narrative evidence on beliefs, attitude, and intention were separately compared. Statistical evidence was found to have a stronger influence than narrative evidence on beliefs and attitude, whereas narrative evidence had a stronger influence on intention. We explain these findings in terms of the match between the specific characteristics of the two types of evidence and those of the outcome variables. Statistical evidence, beliefs, and attitude all relate primarily to cognitive responses, whereas both narrative evidence and intention relate more specifically to affective responses. We conclude that communication professionals developing health campaigns should match the type of evidence to the main communication objectives.","Zebregs, Simon; van den Putte, Bas; Neijens, Peter; de Graaf, Anneke",Health Commun.,2133
An empirical test of neutrality and the crowding-out hypothesis,"This paper tests Warr's neutrality hypothesis that the voluntary provision of a public good is independent of the distribution of income. Specifically, I test the null hypothesis of neutrality against the alternative that total contributions to a public good will be larger the less equally income is distributed. To test this hypothesis, a new data set is constructed by merging data on total voluntary contributions to individual public radio stations with 1990 Census data on the income distribution in each station's listening area. I find that voluntary contributions increase as income inequality rises.","Brunner, E.J.",Public Choice,2134
An exploration of social work educators’ personal experiences of self-awareness,"Self-awareness as a core concept in professional development has captured the attention of social work educators and researchers over the past few decades. Although practicing professional self-awareness is highly recommended; some researchers argue that personal and professional self-awareness are intertwined, thereby, cognition and development of personal self-awareness is a prerequisite for professional self-awareness. Researchers have barely explored individuals’ personal experiences of self-awareness. This study aims to address this gap. Through convenience sampling, 35 social work educators from 27 colleges and universities across the United States agreed to participate in this research. The narrative approach, a qualitative method, was employed to analyze the participants’ experiences. The results revealed that five factors facilitate the process of self-awareness: nourished curiosity, marginality, transformation to invulnerability, disenchantment with society, and loss and death. These themes are covered by two “umbrella themes”, inquisitiveness and suffering. These findings can facilitate professional development. By considering the revealed themes, social work educators can emphasize and elaborate on the relationship between personal and professional experiences of self-awareness in social work practice. Educators can also activate students’ inner abilities and direct their attention toward environmental stimuli in order to raise their self-awareness. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Feize, L.",Soc.

Valproate in the treatment of PTSD: systematic review and meta analysis,"Limited evidence suggested that valproate may be effective for the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder. Further research is required. XCM: The review question was clearly stated and inclusion criteria were defined for participants, outcome and intervention. The criteria for study design were broad, which appeared appropriate given the paucity of identified studies. Several relevant sources were searched and attempts were made to minimise publication and language bias. Study validity was assessed using defined criteria and, although results were mainly reported as an aggregate score, some methodological flaws were summarised in the discussion, including the problem of attrition bias when calculating before and after effect size from aggregate data. Appropriate methods were used to minimise reviewer error and bias in the assessment of study validity, but it was not clear if similar methods were used to select studies for inclusion in the review or extract data. In view of the clinical heterogeneity among studies, particularly with respect to outcome measures, it was questionable if pooling data statistically was appropriate. There were limitations to this review, but overall the authors’ cautious conclusions reflected limited evidence from a small number of poor quality studies. XIM: Practice: The authors stated that in view of the limitations of the existing evidence, valproate cannot be recommended as monotherapy for post-traumatic stress disorder. Research: The authors stated that there is a need for double-blind controlled studies to initially compare valproate with placebo and then compare valproate with selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors in patients with post-traumatic stress disorder.","Adamou, M; Puchalska, S; Plummer, W; Hale, A S",,2136
Intuitive Prosociality,"Prosocial behavior is a central feature of human life and a major focus of research across the natural and social sciences. Most theoretical models of prosociality share a common assumption: Humans are instinctively selfish, and prosocial behavior requires exerting reflective control over these basic instincts. However, findings from several scientific disciplines have recently contradicted this view. Rather than requiring control over instinctive selfishness, prosocial behavior appears to stem from processes that are intuitive, reflexive, and even automatic. These observations suggest that our understanding of prosociality should be revised to include the possibility that, in many cases, prosocial behavior-instead of requiring active control over our impulses-represents an impulse of its own. © The Author(s) 2013.","Zaki, J.; Mitchell, J.P.",Curr.

Acting prosocially reduces retaliation: Effects of prosocial video games on aggressive behavior,"Past research has provided abundant evidence that exposure to violent video games increases aggression and aggression-related variables. In contrast, little is known whether and why video game exposure may also decrease aggressive behavior. In fact, two experiments revealed that playing a prosocial (relative to a neutral) video game reduces aggressive behavior. Mediational analyses showed that differences in both aggressive cognition and aggressive affect underlie the effect of type of video game on aggressive behavior. These findings are in line with assumptions of the General Learning Model and point to the importance of the cognitive and affective routes in predicting how aggressive behavior is affected by exposure to video games. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Greitemeyer, T.; Agthe, M.; Turner, R.; Gschwendtner, C.",Eur.

The cyclicality of government foreign-aid expenditure: voter awareness in “good” times and in “bad”,"While it has been argued that the cyclicality of government spending likely depends on the intensities of political pressure to increase expenditure, in economic upturns and downturns, it is important to explore the determinants of changes in the strengths of those pressures. This paper is the first (to our knowledge) to focus on the relevance of systematic changes in voter awareness of government spending. Predictions of the impact of changes in awareness are tested with reference to 23 OECD donor countries’ foreign aid expenditures over the 1999–2015 period. The evidence offers insights into the discretion governments exercise when “fiscal illusion” increases and into the policy implications of systematic changes in voter awareness (in “good” times and in “bad”). © 2019, The Author(s).","Abbott, A.; Jones, P.",Public Choice,2142

Predicting altruistic behavior and assessing homophily: Evidence from the sisterhood,"The persistence of altruism throughout the evolutionary process has been explained by some on the basis of assortation, which requires the ability to detect dispositional altruism in others and voluntary interaction, resulting in altruism homophily. Numerous studies have identified the ability to detect dispositional altruism in strangers, but few have investigated this ability and altruism homophily in social networks. The purpose of this study is to provide additional evidence with regard to the ability to detect dispositional altruism among individuals who have repeated interactions in a collegiate social organization and the extent of altruism homophily. The results indicate that individuals possess an ability to predict dispositional altruism as measured by behavior in the dictator game and that this ability is a function of social closeness. However, the study does not support the hypothesis of an assortation process that results in altruism homophily. © 2016 The Author( s).","Vernarelli, M.J.",Sociol. Sci.,2145
The television situation comedy and children's prosocial behavior,"The moral lessons of television situation comedies were explored as possible contributors to children's prosocial development. In order to determine if children comprehend the moral lessons of adult sitcoms, children in small groups watched sitcoms and then were individually interviewed to determine if they comprehended the moral lesson. An overwhelming majority of 1st, 3rd, and 5th graders understood moral lessons contained in an episode of The Cosby Show. Similarly, one third of the 1st graders and half of the 3rd graders were able to identify an overarching moral lesson in an episode of Full House. Finally, a correlational analysis was undertaken between the frequency with which the children viewed prosocial sitcoms and the frequency of their prosocial behavior. As anticipated, viewing emerged as a predictor variable, particularly for those subjects who evidenced understanding of the moral lessons of sitcoms.","Rosenkoetter, L.I.",J. Appl. Soc. Psychol.,2146
Systematic review of the effects of interventions for people bereaved by suicide,"There is a lack of robust evidence to be able to provide clear implications for practice for interventions for people bereaved by suicide. XCM: The authors addressed a clear review question, supported by appropriate inclusion criteria. An extensive search was conducted without language restrictions, for both published and unpublished research. Each stage of the review was conducted in duplicate, reducing the potential for error and bias. Study quality was assessed using appropriate criteria, and the results considered during the review. The decision to combine the studies in a narrative synthesis seemed appropriate given the heterogeneity across studies. Several studies only had short-term follow-up. This was a well-conducted review, and the conclusions reflect the lack of evidence available and are likely to be reliable. XIM: Practice: The authors stated that clear implications for practice could not be provided due to the lack of robust evidence. However, they go on to say that the following interventions may be beneficial: psychologist-led group therapy for children who lost a parent; combined health professional and volunteer led group therapy for adults who lost a family member; and family cognitive behavioural therapy with a trained psychiatric nurse.Research: Studies of sufficient size, evaluating an agreed core set of outcome measures, are required, particularly in different ethnic groups.

Process evaluation embedded within an RCT of complex interventions was identified as a method to distinguish interventions that have failed from those that were poorly implemented.",Centre for Reviews and Dissemination,,2147
Evidence for Altruism: Toward a Pluralism of Prosocial Motives,"Psychologists have long assumed that the motivation for all intentional action, including all action intended to benefit others, is egoistic. People benefit others because, ultimately, to do so benefits themselves. The empathy-altruism hypothesis challenges this assumption. It claims that empathic emotion evokes truly altruistic motivation, motivation with an ultimate goal of benefiting not the self but the person for whom empathy is felt. Logical and psychological distinctions between egoism and altruism are reviewed, providing a conceptual framework for empirical tests for the existence of altruism. Results of empirical tests to date are summarized; these results provide impressive support for the empathy-altruism hypothesis. We conclude that the popular and parsimonious explanation of prosocial motivation in terms of universal egoism must give way to a pluralistic explanation that includes altruism as well as egoism. Implications of such a pluralism are briefly noted, not only for our understanding of prosocial motivation but also for our understanding of human nature and of the emotion—motivation link. © 1991, Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

Altruism predicts mating success in humans,"In order for non-kin altruism to evolve, altruists must receive fitness benefits for their actions that outweigh the costs. Several researchers have suggested that altruism is a costly signal of desirable qualities, such that it could have evolved by sexual selection. In two studies, we show that altruism is broadly linked with mating success. In Study 1, participants who scored higher on a self-report altruism measure reported they were more desirable to the opposite sex, as well as reported having more sex partners, more casual sex partners, and having sex more often within relationships. Sex moderated some of these relationships, such that altruism mattered more for men’s number of lifetime and casual sex partners. In Study 2, participants who were willing to donate potential monetary winnings (in a modified dictator dilemma) reported having more lifetime sex partners, more casual sex partners, and more sex partners over the past year. Men who were willing to donate also reported having more lifetime dating partners. Furthermore, these patterns persisted, even when controlling for narcissism, Big Five personality traits, and socially desirable responding. These results suggest that altruists have higher mating success than non-altruists and support the hypothesis that altruism is a sexually selected costly signal of difficult-to-observe qualities. © 2016 The British Psychological Society.","Arnocky, S.; Piché, T.; Albert, G.; Ouellette, D.; Barclay, P.",Br.

Problem solving within professional services: evidence from the medical field,"Purpose – To test the validity of the presumed characteristics of professional services by studying their manifestation in the problem solving that occurs in service production. Design/methodology/approach – The paper uses medical research as secondary data to study the existence of associations between the presumed characteristics of professional services and problem solving in the medical context. A systematic review of empirical studies concerning physicians' prescribing decisions is conducted. Findings – Supporting assumptions presented in the literature, specialist knowledge of professional and customer participation was found to influence prescribing decisions. The assumption regarding collegial control was partially supported. Some degree of contradiction was found with respect to the presumed professional autonomy and altruism. Whilst the professional services literature emphasises factors related to the client's problem, the service encounter and the profession, we conclude that problem solving is influenced also by factors embedded in the related organisational, market and institutional environments. Research limitations/implications – Further empirical validation of the presumed professional characteristics is needed. The results indicate that professional services research should pay more attention to the role of the wider context in professional problem solving. Medical researchers might also benefit from a broader perspective on patient participation. Practical implications – An holistic view of factors that influence physicians' prescribing decisions is of use to managers of health care organisations, marketers of pharmaceuticals, and policy makers and third-party payers. Originality/value – By using an interdisciplinary approach, the paper contributes to professional services research by providing empirical support for the often repeated characteristics of professional services and outlining factors that potentially influence problem solving within professional services. © 2006, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Jaakkola, Elina; Halinen, Aino",International Journal of Service Industry Management,2153
Under what circumstances is helping an impulse? Emergency and prosocial traits affect intuitive prosocial behavior,"While prosocial behavior is suggested to be a central feature of human life, there is an ongoing debate as to whether individuals have developed a general intuitive tendency to act prosocially or not. We show that prosocial behavior is better described as a person × situation interaction. In two studies (total N = 170), we tested the influence of processing mode on helping behavior in emergency and non-emergency situations and the moderating effect of prosocial traits (i.e., Honesty–Humility and social value orientation) using different experimental manipulations. These studies were conducted among Chinese samples, and provide evidence on prosocial behaviors beyond the “WEIRD” population. Consistent with the existing experimental literature on spontaneous cooperation, we consistently found intuitive processing led to more helping behavior. Moreover, this intuitive prosociality is context-dependent, moderated by the emergency and prosocial traits. Overall, we find clear evidence that the role of intuition and deliberation varies across both situations and individuals as predicted by the social heuristics hypothesis. Our findings reconcile previous diverging results by demonstrating these moderators, and extend our understanding of the model of intuitive prosociality based on social heuristics. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Shi, R.; Qi, W.G.; Ding, Y.; Liu, C.; Shen, W.",Pers.

Vividness effects: A resource-matching perspective,"The authors present a resource-matching perspective to explain the relationship between vividness and persuasion. Three experiments confirm the predicted inverted-U relationship between resource allocation and persuasion for vivid information, and a positive linear relationship between resource allocation and persuasion for nonvivid information when vivid information is less resource demanding than nonvivid information. This persuasion pattern is reversed in experiment 4, where nonvivid information is less resource demanding than vivid information; that is, there is an inverted-U relationship for nonvivid information, and a positive linear relationship for vivid information. The contrasting persuasion functions for vivid and nonvivid information can predict when vivid information will be more versus less persuasive than nonvivid information.","Keller, P.A.; Block, L.G.",J.

Further evidence on the dynamic impact of taxes on charitable giving,"We estimate the impact of taxes on donations using a large panel of middle-class taxpayers. Our specification allows estimation of the effects of habits, time shifting, and consumption smoothing on the time path of adjustment and produces plausible simulated adjustment paths to permanent and temporary anticipated tax reforms. We find that taxes determine both the long-run level and the timing of donations, so that even though taxes appear to have long-run behavioral effects, estimates of these effects are exaggerated if one fails to estimate the rescheduling of giving in response to tax regime shifts. Our results challenge the view that tax deductions for charitable giving are efficient.","Barrett, K.S.; Mcguirk, A.M.; Steinberg, R.",Natl. Tax J.,2156
Partner choice versus punishment in human Prisoner's Dilemmas,"Two factors that promote cooperation are partner choice and punishment of defectors, but which option do people actually prefer to use? Punishment is predicted to be more common when organisms cannot escape bad partners, whereas partner choice is useful when one can switch to a better partner. Here we use a modified iterated Prisoner's Dilemma to examine people's cooperation and punishment when partner choice was possible and when it was not. The results show that cooperation was higher when people could leave bad partners versus when they could not. When they could not switch partners, people preferred to actively punish defectors rather than withdraw. When they could switch, punishment and switching were equally preferred. Contrary to our predictions, punishment was higher when switching was possible, possibly because cooperators could then desert the defector they had just punished. Punishment did not increase defectors' subsequent cooperation. Our results support the importance of partner choice in promoting human cooperation and in changing the prevalence of punishment. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Barclay, P.; Raihani, N.",Evol. Hum.

Compliance employing a combined foot-in-the-door and door-in-the-face procedure,"The foot-in-the-door procedure increases compliance for a desired target request by making an easier first request. In the door-in-the-face procedure, compliance is increased by first making an extremely hard request and following this with a target request, the one actually desired. The current study combined both of these procedures and formulated a new compliance technique consisting of two initial requests to precede the target request. Three hundred and eighty subjects selected at random from the telephone directory were called to test the new compliance procedure. The results showed that compliance was significantly greater for the new combination method when compared with both other methods. The theoretical model developed to devise and explain the new method also received support. © 1986 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Goldman, M.",J. Soc. Psychol.,2159
Does kindness always pay? The influence of recipient affection and generosity on young children’s allocation decisions in a resource distribution task,"The aim of the current study was to determine whether the level of generosity shown by 3- to 8-year-old children (N = 136; M age = 69 months) in a resource distribution task would vary according to whether the recipient had previously displayed kind (affection and generosity) and/or non-kind (non-affection and non-generosity) behavior towards a third party. We first asked whether donor children would show higher levels of generosity towards an affectionate than a non-affectionate recipient (condition 1), and a generous than a non-generous recipient (condition 2), before pitting the two forms of recipient kindness directly against each other (condition 3). Last, we asked whether donations to generous recipients would decrease if the recipient simultaneously displayed non-kind behavior through a lack of affection (condition 4). Here we show that children allocated a greater share of the available resource to generous and affectionate recipients than non-generous and non-affectionate recipients respectively. However, when asked to divide resources between a generous and an affectionate recipient, or two recipients who had each displayed a combination of kind and non-kind behavior, children allocated each recipient an equal share of the resource. These findings suggest that children donate selectively based on previous information regarding recipient generosity and affection, however when both forms of kindness are pitted directly against each other, children strive for equality, suggesting that kindness engenders donor generosity irrespective of the form of kindness previously displayed. © 2019, The Author(s).","Blakey, K.H.; Mason, E.; Cristea, M.; McGuigan, N.; Messer, E.J.E.",Curr.

Video games as virtual teachers: Prosocial video game use by children and adolescents from different socioeconomic groups is associated with increased empathy and prosocial behaviour,"Objective The main aim of this study was to determine if there was a positive relationship between prosocial video game use and prosocial behaviour in children and adolescents. Method This study had a cross-sectional correlational design. Data were collected from 538 9-15 year old children and adolescents between March and December 2014. Participants completed measures of empathy, prosocial behaviour and video game habits. Teachers rated the prosocial behaviour of participants. The socioeconomic status of participants was also gathered. Results Multiple linear regressions were conducted on these data. Prosocial video game use was positively associated with the tendency to maintain positive affective relationships, cooperation and sharing as well as empathy. This association remained significant after controlling for gender, age, school type (disadvantaged/non-disadvantaged), socioeconomic status, weekly game play and violent video game use. Conclusions These findings provide evidence that prosocial video game use could develop empathic concern and improve affective relationships in a diverse population of young people. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Harrington, B.; O'Connell, M.",Comput.

Magnetic resonance angiography for the diagnosis of renal artery stenosis: a meta-analysis,"AIM: To review the published literature comparing the diagnostic accuracy of magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) with and without gadolinium in diagnosing renal artery stenosis, using catheter angiography as reference. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A meta-analysis was performed of English language articles identified by computer search using PubMed/MEDLINE, followed by extensive bibliography review from 1985 to May 2001. Inclusion criteria were: (1) blinded comparison with catheter angiography; (2)indication for MRA stated; (3) clear descriptions of imaging techniques; and (4) interval between MRA and catheter angiography < 3 months and only the largest of all studies from one centre was selected in the analysis. RESULTS: A total of 39 studies were identified, of which 25 met the inclusion criteria. The number of patients included in the meta-analysis was 998: 499 with non-enhanced MRA and 499 with gadolinium-enhanced MRA. The sensitivity and specificity of non-enhanced MRA were 94% (95% CI: 90-97%) and 85% (95% CI: 82-87%), respectively. For gadolinium-enhanced MRA sensitivity was 97% (95% CI: 93-98%) and specificity was 93% (95% CI: 91-95%). Thus, specificity and positive predictive value were significantly better for gadolinium-enhanced MRA (P < 0.001). Accessory renal arteries were depicted better by gadolinium-enhanced MRA (82%; 95% CI: 75-87%) than non-gadolinium MRA (49%; 95% CI: 42-60%) (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Gadolinium-enhanced MRA may replace arteriography in most patients with suspected renal artery stenosis, and has major advantages in that it is non-invasive, avoids ionizing radiation and uses a non-nephrotoxic contrast agent.","Tan, K T; van Beek, E J R; Brown, P W G; van Delden, O M; Tijssen, J; Ramsay, L E",Clin.

Heterogeneity in the association between environmental attitudes and pro-environmental behavior: A multilevel regression approach,"Previous research offers mixed results regarding the association between environmental attitudes and behavior. To shed some light on this topic, this article undertakes the first investigation of whether the association between environmental attitudes and pro-environmental behavior is heterogeneous or, more concretely, if the existence of this association depends on the intensity of environmental attitudes. Multilevel regressions were implemented with a nationally representative sample of Spanish people aged 18 years old and older. The results reveal a pattern of heterogeneity, such that pro-environmental behavior is only associated with strong environmental attitudes, as arise when people believe that the environment should be protected, even if this goal is expensive. This study also controls for the influence of socio-economic characteristics on pro-environmental behavior, which correlates positively with education and age. Women exhibit more pro-environmental behavior than men. On the basis of these findings, this article offers notable implications for policy makers and researchers. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Casaló, L.V.; Escario, J.-J.",J. Clean. Prod.,2165
"Pretty as a Princess: Longitudinal Effects of Engagement With Disney Princesses on Gender Stereotypes, Body Esteem, and Prosocial Behavior in Children","This study examined level of engagement with Disney Princess media/products as it relates to gender-stereotypical behavior, body esteem (i.e. body image), and prosocial behavior during early childhood. Participants consisted of 198 children (Mage = 58 months), who were tested at two time points (approximately 1 year apart). Data consisted of parent and teacher reports, and child observations in a toy preference task. Longitudinal results revealed that Disney Princess engagement was associated with more female gender-stereotypical behavior 1 year later, even after controlling for initial levels of gender-stereotypical behavior. Parental mediation strengthened associations between princess engagement and adherence to female gender-stereotypical behavior for both girls and boys, and for body esteem and prosocial behavior for boys only. © 2016 The Authors.

Effects of songs with prosocial lyrics on prosocial behavior: Further evidence and a mediating mechanism,"Previous research has shown that exposure to prosocial songs increased the accessibility of prosocial thoughts, led to more interpersonal empathy, and fostered helping behavior. However, inasmuch as cognition, affect, and behavior were measured in different studies, it remained unclear what variable constituted the mediating path from media exposure to action. This was tested in the present research. In four studies, listening to songs with prosocial, relative to neutral, lyrics increased helping behavior. This effect was mediated by interpersonal empathy. The results are consistent with the general learning model and point to the importance of the affective route in explaining how media exposure influences social behavior. © 2009 by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc.","Greitemeyer, T.",Pers.

The Impact of Revenue Diversification on Nonprofit Financial Health: A Meta-analysis,"This study reviews the influence of revenue stream diversification on financial health. It is a meta-analysis of previous studies that have studied the relationship. This literature variously demonstrates that nonprofit financial health is improved, not influenced or harmed by diversifying reliance on different revenue streams. Our analysis of 40 original studies reporting 296 statistical effects demonstrates a small, positive, yet statistically significant association between revenue diversification and nonprofit financial health. In addition, we show that granularity of measurement of revenue diversification influences effect size, that this effect has shifted over time, and that studies on U.S. nonprofits demonstrate weaker (or more negative) effects. However, few other prominent suspects, including diversity of financial health measure or methodology choices, explain variations in effects across the literature on revenue diversification. Overall, the study supports the contention that both analysts and practitioners should make strategic considerations that have generally escaped scholarship on revenue diversification or shift attention to revenue optimization considerations that have been raised by portfolio theory. © The Author(s) 2018.","Hung, C.; Hager, M.A.",Nonprofit Volunt.

Adult criticism and vigilance diminish free riding by children in a social dilemma,"In cooperative situations, individual interests can be in conflict with those of the group, creating a social dilemma in which one must choose whether to cooperate or not. Sensitivity to social stimuli is an important factor influencing cooperative behavior in such dilemmas. The current study investigated the influence of verbal feedback and vigilance by adults on children's donating behavior in a public goods game. The participants were 739 public school children, between 5 and 12 years of age, who were divided into 34 groups. Each group was assigned to one of four experimental conditions: control, positive feedback (praise), negative feedback (criticism), or vigilance. Participants then played eight rounds of the game. The children's donations were greater in the feedback and vigilance conditions, but the effects were mediated by age and rounds. The results are most likely related to concerns about reputation, which tend to become stronger with age. Older children are better at self-presentation and understanding social norms. Thus, compared with younger children, they seemed more concerned with appearing to be generous, but only when they could get credit for it. Nevertheless, children's donations still decreased across the rounds. Although adult vigilance and feedback influence children's cooperation among peers, other mechanisms are necessary to stabilize their behavior over time. © 2017","Dutra, N.B.; Boccardi, N.C.; Silva, P.R.R.; Siqueira, J.D.O.; Hattori, W.T.; Yamamoto, M.E.; Alencar, A.I.D.",J.

Beliefs about the controllability of social characteristics and children’s jealous responses to outsiders’ interference in friendship,"Although some jealous children respond to outsider interference in friendships with problem solving and discussion, others withdraw from the relationship or retaliate against the friends or others. Beliefs about the nature of social characteristics are proposed as an explanation for behavioral heterogeneity in response to jealous provocation. Based on learned helplessness theory and research on children’s implicit personality theories, children who subscribed strongly to the belief that social characteristics are fixed and that social outcomes are uncontrollable (high entity beliefs), were expected to more strongly endorse asocial and antisocial responses and less strongly endorse prosocial responses to outsider interference than children who did not have strong entity beliefs, depending on their internal versus external attributions of blame. Two hundred eighty-six children in sixth through eighth grades (primarily Caucasian) participated in an experimental test of this hypothesis. Although hypothesized interactions between beliefs and locus of blame were not supported, results indicated that children who believe social characteristics are changeable also believed they had more control in the internal condition than children who believe social characteristics are immutable. Further, pessimistic children were more likely to tend to endorse asocial and antisocial behavior and less likely to endorse prosocial behavior than optimistic children. © 2019 Lavallee, Parker.

The nature of human altruism,"Some of the most fundamental questions concerning our evolutionary origins, our social relations, and the organization of society are centred around issues of altruism and selfishness. Experimental evidence indicates that human altruism is a powerful force and is unique in the animal world. However, there is much individual heterogeneity and the interaction between altruists and selfish individuals is vital to human cooperation. Depending on the environment, a minority of altruists can force a majority of selfish individuals to cooperate or, conversely, a few egoists can induce a large number of altruists to defect. Current gene-based evolutionary theories cannot explain important patterns of human altruism, pointing towards the importance of both theories of cultural evolution as well as gene-culture co-evolution.","Fehr, E.; Fischbacher, U.",Nature,2173

"Greener Than Thou: People who protect the environment are more cooperative, compete to be environmental, and benefit from reputation","Protecting the environment is a social dilemma: environmental protection benefits everyone but is individually costly. We propose that protecting the environment is similar to other types of cooperation, in that environmentalism functions as a signal of one's willingness to cooperate with others. We test several novel predictions from this hypothesis. We used a mathematical model to show that environmentalism can indicate one's valuation of others and thus one's cooperative intent. We found support for this prediction in two online studies, and then conducted two laboratory studies to extend the idea that environmentalism signals one's willingness to cooperate. Participants donated more to an environmental charity when donations were public than when anonymous, but they donated the most when competing to be chosen by an observer for a subsequent cooperative game. In other words, people competed to donate more to the environment. Bigger donors benefited, as they were subsequently chosen more often and received more cooperation from their partners. Partners benefited from choosing environmental donors: bigger donors cooperated more with subsequent partners, such that environmental donations were reliably informative about participants’ future cooperativeness. We compare multiple theories about why people behave environmentally (indirect reciprocity, signal of wealth, signal of cooperative intent), and find most support for our proposed theory of signaling cooperative intent. By understanding the function of environmental behaviour and stimulating competitive giving, we can increase people's support for environmental and other charitable causes. © 2020 The Authors","Barclay, P.; Barker, J.L.",J.

Community first responders and responder schemes in the United Kingdom: systematic scoping review,"BACKGROUND: Community First Responder (CFR) schemes support lay people to respond to medical emergencies, working closely with ambulance services. They operate widely in the UK. There has been no previous review of UK literature on these schemes. This is the first systematic scoping review of UK literature on CFR schemes, which identifies the reasons for becoming a CFR, requirements for training and feedback and confusion between the CFR role and that of ambulance service staff. This study also reveals gaps in the evidence base for CFR schemes. METHODS: We conducted a systematic scoping review of the published literature, in the English language from 2000 onwards using specific search terms in six databases. Narrative synthesis was used to analyse article content. RESULTS: Nine articles remained from the initial search of 15,969 articles after removing duplicates, title and abstract and then full text review. People were motivated to become CFRs through an altruistic desire to help others. They generally felt rewarded by their work but recognised that the help they provided was limited by their training compared with ambulance staff. There were concerns about the possible emotional impact on CFRs responding to incidents. CFRs felt that better feedback would enhance their learning. Ongoing training and support were viewed as essential to enable CFRs to progress. They perceived that public recognition of the CFR role was low, patients sometimes confusing them with ambulance staff. Relationships with the ambulance service were sometimes ambivalent due to confusion over roles. There was support for local autonomy of CFR schemes but with greater sharing of best practice. DISCUSSION: Most studies dated from 2005 and were descriptive rather than analytical. In the UK and Australia CFRs are usually lay volunteers equipped with basic skills for responding to medical emergencies, whereas in the US they include other emergency staff as well as lay people. CONCLUSION: Opportunities for future research include exploring experiences and perceptions of patients who have been treated by CFRs and other stakeholders, while also evaluating the effectiveness and costs of CFR schemes.","Phung, Viet-Hai; Trueman, Ian; Togher, Fiona; Orner, Roderick; Siriwardena, A Niroshan",Scand.

Surveillance or Self-Surveillance? Behavioral Cues Can Increase the Rate of Drivers’ Pro-Environmental Behavior at a Long Wait Stop,"By leaving their engines idling for long periods, drivers contribute unnecessarily to air pollution, waste fuel, and produce noise and fumes that harm the environment. Railway level crossings are sites where many cars idle, many times a day. In this research, testing two psychological theories of influence, we examine the potential to encourage drivers to switch off their ignition while waiting at rail crossings. Two field studies presented different signs at a busy rail crossing site with a 2-min average wait. Inducing public self-focus (via a “Watching Eyes” stimulus) was not effective, even when accompanied by a written behavioral instruction. Instead, cueing a private-self focus (“think of yourself”) was more effective, doubling the level of behavioral compliance. These findings confirm the need to engage the self when trying to instigate self-regulatory action, but that cues evoking self-surveillance may sometimes be more effective than cues that imply external surveillance. © 2017, © 2017 The Author(s).","Meleady, R.; Abrams, D.; Van de Vyver, J.; Hopthrow, T.; Mahmood, L.; Player, A.; Lamont, R.; Leite, A.C.",Environ.

Healthy Selfishness and Pathological Altruism: Measuring Two Paradoxical Forms of Selfishness,"Selfishness is often regarded as an undesirable or even immoral characteristic, whereas altruism is typically considered universally desirable and virtuous. However, human history as well as the works of humanistic and psychodynamic psychologists point to a more complex picture: not all selfishness is necessarily bad, and not all altruism is necessarily good. Based on these writings, we introduce new scales for the assessment of individual differences in two paradoxical forms of selfishness that have lacked measurement in the field – healthy selfishness (HS) and pathological altruism (PA). In two studies (N1 = 370, N2 = 891), we constructed and validated the HS and PA scales. The scales showed good internal consistency and a clear two-dimensional structure across both studies. HS was related to higher levels of psychological well-being and adaptive psychological functioning as well as a genuine prosocial orientation. PA was associated with maladaptive psychological outcomes, vulnerable narcissism, and selfish motivations for helping others. These results underpin the paradoxical nature of both constructs. We discuss the implications for future research, including clinical implications. © Copyright © 2020 Kaufman and Jauk.","Kaufman, S.B.; Jauk, E.",Front. Psychol.,2182
"Music, Pandas, and Muggers: On the Affective Psychology of Value","This research investigated the relationship between the magnitude or scope of a stimulus and its subjective value by contrasting 2 psychological processes that may be used to construct preferences: valuation by feeling and valuation by calculation. The results show that when people rely on feeling, they are sensitive to the presence or absence of a stimulus (i.e., the difference between 0 and some scope) but are largely insensitive to further variations of scope. In contrast, when people rely on calculation, they reveal relatively more constant sensitivity to scope. Thus, value is nearly a step function of scope when feeling predominates and is closer to a linear function when calculation predominates. These findings may allow for a novel interpretation of why most real-world value functions are concave and how the processes responsible for nonlinearity of value may also contribute to nonlinear probability weighting.","Hsee, C.K.; Rottenstreich, Y.",J.

Further, the actions were most likely to be initiated by adult White males and many acts were depicted in a humorous, realistic, and rewarding context. In terms of channel differences, shows on children's basic cable featured not only the highest proportion of programs with one or more instances of altruism but also the highest rate per hour (4.02 acts).

Internet-based physical activity interventions: a systematic review of the literature,"BACKGROUND: Nowadays people are extensively encouraged to become more physically active. The Internet has been brought forward as an effective tool to change physical activity behavior. However, little is known about the evidence regarding such Internet-based interventions. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to systematically assess the methodological quality and the effectiveness of interventions designed to promote physical activity by means of the Internet as evaluated by randomized controlled trials. METHODS: A literature search was conducted up to July 2006 using the databases PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Library. Only randomized controlled trials describing the effectiveness of an Internet-based intervention, with the promotion of physical activity among adults being one of its major goals, were included. Data extracted included source and year of publication, country of origin, targeted health behaviors, participants' characteristics, characteristics of the intervention, and effectiveness data. In addition, the methodological quality was assessed. RESULTS: The literature search resulted in 10 eligible studies of which five met at least nine out of 13 general methodological criteria. The majority of the interventions were tailored to the characteristics of the participants and used interactive self-monitoring and feedback tools. Six studies used one or more theoretical models to compose the contents of the interventions. One study used an objective measure to assess the amount of physical activity (activity monitor), and six studies used multiple subjective measures of physical activity. Furthermore, half of the studies employed measures of physical fitness other than physical activity. In three studies, an Internet-based physical activity intervention was compared with a waiting list group. Of these three studies, two reported a significantly greater improvement in physical activity levels in the Internet-based intervention than in the control group. Seven studies compared two types of Internet-based physical activity interventions in which the main difference was either the intensity of contact between the participants and supervisors (4 studies) or the type of treatment procedures applied (3 studies). In one of these studies, a significant effect in favor of an intervention with more supervisor contact was seen. CONCLUSIONS: There is indicative evidence that Internet-based physical activity interventions are more effective than a waiting list strategy. The added value of specific components of Internet-based physical activity interventions such as increased supervisor contact, tailored information, or theoretical fidelity remains to be established. Methodological quality as well as the type of physical activity outcome measure varied, stressing the need for standardization of these measures.","van den Berg, Marleen H; Schoones, Johannes W; Vliet Vlieland, Theodora P M",J.

Altruistic decisions are influenced by the allocation of monetary incentives in a pain-sharing game,"Background Altruistic behavior is essential to the sustainability of society, but our current understanding of its underlying motivation is limited. In addition to the intrinsic motives to help others, based on empathy, extrinsic motives such as monetary incentives and social reputation influence prosociality. The purpose of this study was to examine the underlying motivations of prosocial behavior under constant or increasing extrinsic motivation settings. Methods An experimental task, Altruistic Pain Sharing, was developed in which the participants were asked to share the other participants’ pain. In the session with monetary incentives, the incentives were given either constantly (CONSTANT condition) or proportionally (INCREASING condition), to the amount of shared pain. In addition, monetary incentives were not provided in the NO session. The participants experienced different amounts of mechanical pain at the beginning of the task and chose the number of pain stimulations to share, based on their experiences. Results Compared to the NO session, the INCREASING session exhibited a rise in the mean of shared pain, but not the CONSTANT session. Furthermore, there was a distinct tendency to receive less pain than the other participant in the CONSTANT session, and a tendency to receive more pain than the other participant in the INCREASING session. Conclusion Prosocial behavior was influenced by the presence, as well as the form, of the extrinsic monetary incentives. Our study shows that rewards incentivize individuals to demonstrate a higher level of prosocial behavior, implying that prosocial behavior is itself a mixture of intrinsic and extrinsic motivations, and that an effectively designed rewards system may function to enhance prosocial behavior. © 2019 Lee et al.

Is social nudging too emotionally taxing? A field experiment of public utilities and electricity consumers in Denmark,"Appeals to act pro-socially are becoming an increasingly popular way for utilities and authorities to encourage environmental-friendly behavior because of lower financial costs than if price incentives were used. However, recent research suggests that these measures might be emotionally taxing for utility consumers. In this article, we present the results from a randomized field experiment conducted on a sample of 1967 customers serviced by a Danish electricity company. Our results support the suggestion that socially motivated appeals are significantly more emotionally taxing than monetary incentives. We find that this difference disappears when the pro-social appeal is supplemented with a monetary incentive. Finally, we suggest a strategy for reducing emotional ‘costs’ of pro-social appeals without increasing financial costs or reducing the effectiveness of the appeal. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Jensen, C.L.; Andersen, L.M.; Hansen, L.G.; Henningsen, G.",Energy Res.

The effects of self-perception and perceptual contrast upon compliance with socially undesirable requests,"The relative effects of self-perception and perceptual contrast upon rate of compliance with a counter-normative request were studied in a 5 by 2 by 2 design that combined five sizes of the initial request, two levels of authority, and sex. Increased compliance was obtained only when the initial requests were either moderately small or excessively large, but not when they were either very small or moderately large. © 1982, The Psychonomic Society, Inc..

Empathy and Its Discontents,"What role does the experience of feeling what you think others are feeling – often known as ‘empathy’ – have in moral deliberation and moral action? Empathy has many fans and there is abundant evidence that it can motivate prosocial behavior. However, empathy is narrow in its focus, rendering it innumerate and subject to bias. It can motivate cruelty and aggression and lead to burnout and exhaustion. Compassion is distinct from empathy in its neural instantiation and its behavioral consequences and is a better prod to moral action, particularly in the modern world we live in. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Bloom, P.",Trends Cogn.

Donors’ Responses to Profit Incentives in the Social Sector: The Entrepreneurial Orientation Reward and the Profit Penalty,"This study uses an online survey experiment to test whether the pairing of profit-seeking with mission-related programs in the social sector attracts or deters donations from individual donors. We test individuals’ response to three types of profit incentives allowed under current U.S. public policy: (1) non-distributed profit to an organization, which is allowed for nonprofit entities; (2) profit to the organization's equity investors and owners, which is allowed under for-profit social enterprise governance charters; and (3) profit to lending investors, which is introduced by social impact bonds, a pay-for-success policy tool. We test trust theory, under which profit incentives deter donors against entrepreneurial orientation (EO) theory, which suggests that donors are attracted to organizations that use innovative, market-driven programs. Findings indicate support for both theories, but the support depends on how the specific profit incentive is structured. Donors support organizations that use profit-generating social enterprise programs—but only when the profits are non-distributable; donors’ support is significantly lower for social enterprises in which owners and equity investors may profit. Importantly however, this negative effect is not found for pay-for-success policy tools where lending investors, rather than equity investors and owners, receive profits. © 2019 by the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management","Faulk, L.; Pandey, S.; Pandey, S.K.; Scott Kennedy, K.",J.

"Markets, religion, community size, and the evolution of fairness and punishment","Large-scale societies in which strangers regularly engage in mutually beneficial transactions are puzzling. The evolutionary mechanisms associated with kinship and reciprocity, which underpin much of primate sodality, do not readily extend to large unrelated groups. Theory suggests that the evolution of such societies may have required norms and institutions that sustain fairness in ephemeral exchanges. If that is true, then engagement in larger-scale institutions, such as markets and world religions, should be associated with greater fairness, and larger communities should punish unfairness more. Using three behavioral experiments administered across 15 diverse populations, we show that market integration (measured as the percentage of purchased calories) positively covaries with fairness while community size positively covaries with punishment. Participation in a world religion is associated with fairness, although not across all measures. These results suggest that modern prosociality is not solely the product of an innate psychology, but also reflects norms and institutions that have emerged over the course of human history.","Henrich, J.; Ensminger, J.; McElreath, R.; Barr, A.; Barrett, C.; Bolyanatz, A.; Cardenas, J.C.; Gurven, M.; Gwako, E.; Henrich, N.; Lesorogol, C.; Marlowe, F.; Tracer, D.; Ziker, J.",Science,2193

"Large-scale cooperation driven by reputation, not fear of divine punishment","Reputational considerations favour cooperation and thus we expect less cooperation in larger communities where people are less well known to each other. Some argue that institutions are, therefore, necessary to coordinate large-scale cooperation, including moralizing religions that promote cooperation through the fear of divine punishment. Here, we use community size as a proxy for reputational concerns, and test whether people in small, stable communities are more cooperative than people in large, less stable communities in both religious and non-religious contexts. We conducted a donation game on a large naturalistic sample of 501 people in 17 communities, with varying religions or none, ranging from small villages to large cities in northwestern China. We found that more money was donated by those in small, stable communities, where reputation should be more salient. Religious practice was also associated with higher donations, but fear of divine punishment was not. In a second game on the same sample, decisions were private, giving donors the opportunity to cheat. We found that donors to religious institutions were not less likely to cheat, and community size was not important in this game. Results from the donation game suggest donations to both religious and non-religious institutions are being motivated by reputational considerations, and results from both games suggest fear of divine punishment is not important. This chimes with other studies suggesting social benefits rather than fear of punishment may be the more salient motive for cooperative behaviour in real-world settings. © 2019 The Authors.","Ge, E.; Chen, Y.; Wu, J.; Mace, R.",R.

Door-in-the-face and but-you-are-free: Testing the effect of combining two no-pressure compliance paradigms,"According to Howard’s proposal of chaining compliance techniques and based on the proximity of interpretation of their effects, this study aimed to test a combination of two paradigms: a door-in-the-face request that makes a high-cost request before the target request and the but-you-are-free request that adds an evocation of freedom to the request. Two experiments were conducted (N = 120 and 1,292) to promote donations to non-profit organizations. There were four conditions. Participants were approached according to the door-in-the-face procedure, to the but-you-are-free procedure, to a combination of both of them, or directly in a control condition. There was an increase of compliance rates in experimental conditions compared to the control condition and an increase in the average amount donated in the combination condition compared to the control condition in the second study.

"Video Games Do Indeed Influence Children and Adolescents’ Aggression, Prosocial Behavior, and Academic Performance: A Clearer Reading of Ferguson (2015)","Psychological scientists have long sought to determine the relative impact of environmental influences over development and behavior in comparison with the impact of personal, dispositional, or genetic influences. This has included significant interest in the role played by media in children’s development with a good deal of emphasis on how violent media spark and shape aggressive behavior in children and adolescents. Despite a variety of methodological weaknesses in his meta-analysis, Ferguson (2015, this issue) presents evidence to support the positive association between violent media consumption and a number of poor developmental outcomes.

Evolutionary Criminology: Towards a Comprehensive Explanation of Crime,"In our attempts to understand crime, researchers typically focus on proximate factors such as the psychology of offenders, their developmental history, and the social structure in which they are embedded. While these factors are important, they dont tell the whole story. Evolutionary Criminology: Towards a Comprehensive Explanation of Crime explores how evolutionary biology adds to our understanding of why crime is committed, by whom, and our response to norm violations. This understanding is important both for a better understanding of what precipitates crime and to guide approaches for effectively managing criminal behavior. This book is divided into three parts. Part I reviews evolutionary biology concepts important for understanding human behavior, including crime. Part II focuses on theoretical approaches to explaining crime, including the evolution of cooperation, and the evolutionary history and function of violent crime, drug use, property offending, and white collar crime. The developmental origins of criminal behavior are described to account for the increase in offending during adolescence and early adulthood as well as to explain why some offenders are more likely to desist than others. Proximal causes of crime are examined, as well as cultural and structural processes influencing crime. Part III considers human motivation to punish norm violators and what this means for the development of a criminal justice system. This section also considers how an evolutionary approach contributes to our understanding of crime prevention and reduction. The section closes with an evolutionary approach to understanding offender rehabilitation and reintegration. © 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.","Durrant, R.; Ward, T.",Evol.

A second look at partisanship’s effect on receptivity to social pressure to vote,"Social pressure can exert a powerful, but sometimes counterproductive, influence on compliance with the social norm of voting. Scholars have tested several implicit social pressure techniques to reduce negative reactions to these methods. Among the most innovative is the use of ‘watching eyes’ in voter mobilization messages. Using three large randomized field experiments, this study attempts to reproduce Panagopoulos and van der Linden’s finding that political partisanship moderates the effect of watching eyes messages on voter turnout. Our findings diverge from previous findings statistically and substantively and indicate partisanship may have limited influence on the effectiveness of watching eyes in mobilizing voters. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Matland, R.E.; Murray, G.R.",Soc.

Menopausal hormone therapy and risk of lung cancer: systematic review and meta-analysis,"Ever use of hormone therapy in non-smoking women may increase the risk of adenocarcinoma of the lung. Data from RCTs suggest that oestrogen/progestin therapy increases the risk of lung cancer. XCM: The review addressed a focused question and inclusion criteria were clearly defined. Extensive literature searches were conducted and these included attempts to identify unpublished studies. Appropriate steps were taken to minimise bias and errors at all stages of the review process. Study quality was reported to have been assessed, but the exact items considered and results of the quality assessment were not reported and so the reliability of the included studies remained unclear. Very few details of the included studies (such as sample size and participant details) were reported, which made it difficult to determine the generalisability of the review findings. Data were pooled from studies that used different designs; the appropriateness of this was questionable. Only one of the analyses was reported separately for RCTs and the results from these studies were in the opposite direction to those from studies of other designs. The authors' primary conclusions were based on two non-RCT studies of unknown size and quality. The reliability of their conclusions is unclear. XIM: Practice: The authors did not state any implications for practice.Research: The authors stated that dedicated studies designed to more adequately delineate the role of menopausal hormone therapy were necessary to substantiate whether use of such therapy was a risk factor for adenocarcinoma or other types of lung cancer.","Greiser, C M; Greiser, E M; Doren, M",,2204
Moral bargain hunters purchase moral righteousness when it is cheap: Within-individual effect of stake size in economic games,"Despite the repeatedly raised criticism that findings in economic games are specific to situations involving trivial incentives, most studies that have examined the stake-size effect have failed to find a strong effect. Using three prisoner's dilemma experiments, involving 479 non-student residents of suburban Tokyo and 162 students, we show here that stake size strongly affects a player's cooperation choices in prisoner's dilemma games when stake size is manipulated within each individual such that each player faces different stake sizes. Participants cooperated at a higher rate when stakes were lower than when they were higher, regardless of the absolute stake size. These findings suggest that participants were 'moral bargain hunters' who purchased moral righteousness at a low price when they were provided with a 'price list' of prosocial behaviours. In addition, the moral bargain hunters who cooperated at a lower stake but not at a higher stake did not cooperate in a single-stake one-shot game.","Yamagishi, T.; Li, Y.; Matsumoto, Y.; Kiyonari, T.",Sci.

Comparing outcomes of donation after cardiac death versus donation after brain death in liver transplant recipients with hepatitis C: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"BACKGROUND: Liver transplantation (LT) using organs donated after cardiac death (DCD) is increasing due, in large part, to a shortage of organs. The outcome of using DCD organs in recipients with hepatits C virus (HCV) infection remains unclear due to the limited experience and number of publications addressing this issue. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical outcomes of DCD versus donation after brain death (DBD) in HCV-positive patients undergoing LT. METHODS: Studies comparing DCD versus DBD LT in HCV-positive patients were identified based on systematic searches of seven electronic databases and multiple sources of gray literature. RESULTS: The search identified 58 citations, including three studies, with 324 patients meeting eligibility criteria. The use of DCD livers was associated with a significantly higher risk of primary nonfunction (RR 5.49 [95% CI 1.53 to 19.64]; P=0.009; I2=0%), while not associated with a significantly different patient survival (RR 0.89 [95% CI 0.37 to 2.11]; P=0.79; I2=51%), graft survival (RR 0.40 [95% CI 0.14 to 1.11]; P=0.08; I2=34%), rate of recurrence of severe HCV infection (RR 2.74 [95% CI 0.36 to 20.92]; P=0.33; I2=84%), retransplantation or liver disease-related death (RR 1.79 [95% CI 0.66 to 4.84]; P=0.25; I2=44%), and biliary complications. CONCLUSIONS: While the literature and quality of studies assessing DCD versus DBD grafts are limited, there was significantly more primary nonfunction and a trend toward decreased graft survival, but no significant difference in biliary complications or recipient mortality rates between DCD and DBD LT in patients with HCV infection. There is insufficient literature on the topic to draw any definitive conclusions.","Wells, Malcolm; Croome, Kris M; Janik, Toni; Hernandez-Alejandro, Roberto M; Chandok, Natasha M",Can J Gastroenterol Hepatol,2206

"Institutions, motivations and public goods: An experimental test of motivational crowding","Contributions to public goods can be motivated by intrinsic factors such as warm glow altruism and fairness, as well as extrinsic incentives such as sanctions and payments. However, psychological studies suggest that formal extrinsic incentives may crowd out intrinsic motivations. In an experimental study of individual contributions to a public good we find that suasion crowded in voluntary contributions, while an extrinsic incentive in the form of a regulation led to crowding out. This has implications for the design of public policy where ranges of motivations are present. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","Reeson, A.F.; Tisdell, J.G.",J. Econ. Behav. Organ.,2208
The effectiveness of celebrity endorsements: a meta-analysis,"Celebrities frequently endorse products, brands, political candidates, or health campaigns. We investigated the effectiveness of such endorsements by meta-analyzing 46 studies published until April 2016 involving 10,357 participants. Applying multilevel meta-analysis, we analyzed celebrity endorsements in the context of for-profit and non-profit marketing. Findings revealed strong positive and negative effects when theoretically relevant moderators were included in the analysis. The most positive attitudinal effect appeared for male actors who match well with an implicitly endorsed object (d = .90). The most negative effect was found for female models not matching well with an explicitly endorsed object (d = −.96). Furthermore, celebrity endorsements performed worse compared to endorsements of quality seals, awards, or endorser brands. No publication bias was detected. The study has theoretical and practical implications, and provides an agenda for future research.

Psychosocial health of living kidney donors: a systematic review,"The psychosocial health of most donors appears unchanged or improved by donation. The proportion who experience negative outcomes would appear to be small, and the majority of donors reported that they would repeat the experience. XCM: The review question was clear and was supported by appropriate inclusion criteria relating to the participants, intervention, study design and outcomes. Attempts were made to identify all the relevant literature by searching several electronic databases and reference lists, but the restriction to publications in English might have introduced language bias. It appears that the review was conducted with some efforts to minimise error and bias, but the methods applied at the study selection stage were unclear. The use of a narrative synthesis seems appropriate given the heterogeneity of the included studies. Some studies included in the review comprised small study samples and the majority of studies were conducted retrospectively, both of which could have introduced further biases. Under-reporting of the included studies precluded a full assessment of quality. The authors’ conclusion may be overestimated in terms of the evidence presented, and its reliability is unclear because of some methodological concerns about the review process, uncertainty regarding study quality, and the authors’ variable reporting of the results.

Cost-effectiveness of management strategies for acute urethritis in the developing world,"OBJECTIVE: To recommend a cost-effective approach for the management of acute male urethritis in the developing world, based on the findings of a theoretical study. METHODS: A model was developed to assess the cost-effectiveness of three urethritis management strategies in a theoretical cohort of 1000 men with urethral syndrome. (1) All patients were treated with cefixime and doxycycline for gonococcal urethritis (GU) and nongonococcal urethritis (NGU), respectively, as recommended by WHO. (2) All patients were treated with doxycycline for NGU; treatment with cefixime was based on the result of direct microscopy of a urethral smear. (3) All patients were treated with cotrimoxazole or kanamycin for GU and doxycycline for NGU. Cefixime was kept for patients not responding to the first GU treatment. Strategy costs included consultations, laboratory diagnosis (where applicable) and drugs. The outcome was the rate of patients cured of urethritis. Cost-effectiveness was measured in terms of cost per cured urethritis. RESULTS: Strategy costs in our model depended largely on drug costs. The first strategy was confirmed as the most effective but also the most expensive approach. Cefixime should cost no more than US$ 1.5 for the strategy to be the most cost-effective. The second strategy saved money and drugs but proved a valuable alternative only when laboratory performance was optimal. The third strategy with cotrimoxazole was the least expensive but a low follow-up visit rate, poor treatment compliance or lower drug efficacy limited effectiveness. Maximizing compliance by replacing cotrimoxazole with single-dose kanamycin had the single greatest impact on the effectiveness of the third strategy. CONCLUSION: Our model suggested that a cost-effective approach would be to treat gonorrhoea with a single-dose antibiotic selected from locally available products that cost no more than US$ 1.5.","Crabbé, F; Vuylsteke, B; de Clerck, M; Laga, M",Trop.

Battling the Devolution in the Research on Corporate Philanthropy,"The conceptual literature increasingly portrays corporate philanthropy (CP) as an old-fashioned and ineffective operationalization of a firm’s corporate social responsibility. In contrast, empirical research indicates that corporations of all sizes, and both in developed and emerging economies, actively practice CP. This disadvantaged status of the concept, and research, on CP, complicates the advancement of our knowledge about the topic. In a systematic review of the literature containing 122 journal articles on CP, we show that this business practice is loaded with unique characteristics, strengths, and weaknesses, and both conceptual and practical challenges that require renewed attention. We identify six interrelated but distinctive research themes in the literature: concept, motives, determinants, practices, business outcomes, and social outcomes. Dividing the literature on CP into six research themes creates an insightful comprehensive map of this intellectual terrain. Moreover, we distinguish among the level at which CP is analyzed: individual, organizational, institutional, or any combination of these levels. The review reveals significant gaps in the knowledge on CP. Most importantly we find that the conceptualization is limited, the research is mostly quantitative, the effects of CP on society are severely under-researched, and there is a lack of multilevel analyses. A detailed future research agenda is offered, including specific suggestions for research designs and measurements.

An experimental analysis of ultimatum bargaining,"There are many experimental studies of bargaining behavior, but suprisingly enough nearly no attempt has been made to investigate the so-called ultimatum bargaining behavior experimentally. The special property of ultimatum bargaining games is that on every stage of the bargaining process only one player has to decide and that before the last stage the set of outcomes is already restricted to only two results. To make the ultimatum aspect obvious we concentrated on situations with two players and two stages. In the 'easy games' a given amount c has to be distributed among the two players, whereas in the 'complicated games' the players have to allocate a bundle of black and white chips with different values for both players. We performed two main experiments for easy games as well as for complicated games. By a special experiment it was investigated how the demands of subjects as player 1 are related to their acceptance decisions as player 2. © 1982.","Güth, W.; Schmittberger, R.; Schwarze, B.",J.

Noncitizen Voting Rights in the Global Era: a Literature Review and Analysis,"Today, people are moving from countryside to city, city to city, and country to country at one of the highest rates in human history. Globalization, poverty, war, persecution, and environmental crises—as well as the pursuit of safety and better economic opportunities—are propelling a mass migration of people from the Global South to the Global North. In response, some countries have limited immigration directly or restricted certain rights and privileges to discourage immigrants. Conversely, other countries have provided refuge and expanded pathways to rights and benefits out of altruism and humanity, economic self-interest, or both. As the pace of global migration has increased, the idea that political rights should follow or accompany immigrants has also grown and gained traction. Voting is one such right. Most countries typically limit voting rights to its citizens. However, during the past several decades, some have extended the franchise to noncitizen residents. In fact, at least forty-five countries presently allow noncitizen residents to vote in their local, regional, or even national elections. What is driving the expansion of noncitizen voting (NCV)? Where and to what ends are such policies being enacted? For this article, the authors conducted a systematic review to examine these questions and assess the implications of enfranchisement for advancing immigrant incorporation and democratic practice. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Ferris, D.; Hayduk, R.; Richards, A.; Schubert, E.S.; Acri, M.",J.

Insensitivity to the Value of Human Life: A Study of Psychophysical Numbing,"A fundamental principle of psychophysics is that people's ability to discriminate change in a physical stimulus diminishes as the magnitude of the stimulus increases. We find that people also exhibit diminished sensitivity in valuing lifesaving interventions against a background of increasing numbers of lives at risk. We call this ""psychophysical numbing."" Studies 1 and 2 found that an intervention saving a fixed number of lives was judged significantly more beneficial when fewer lives were at risk overall. Study 3 found that respondents wanted the minimum number of lives a medical treatment would have to save to merit a fixed amount of funding to be much greater for a disease with a larger number of potential victims than for a disease with a smaller number. The need to better understand the dynamics of psychophysical numbing and to determine its effects on decision making is discussed.","Fetherstonhaugh, D.; Slovic, P.; Johnson, S.M.; Friedrich, J.",J.

A systematic review of autoresuscitation after cardiac arrest,"OBJECTIVE: There is a lack of consensus on how long circulation must cease for death to be determined after cardiac arrest. The lack of scientific evidence concerning autoresuscitation influences the practice of organ donation after cardiac death. We conducted a systematic review to summarize the evidence on the timing of autoresuscitation. DATA SOURCES: Electronic databases were searched from date of first issue of each journal until July 2008. STUDY SELECTION: Any original study reporting autoresuscitation, as defined by the unassisted return of spontaneous circulation after cardiac arrest, was considered eligible. Reports of electrocardiogram activity without signs of return of circulation were excluded. DATA EXTRACTION: For each study case, we extracted patient characteristics, duration of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, terminal heart rhythms, time to unassisted return of spontaneous circulation, monitoring, and outcomes. DATA SYNTHESIS: A total of 1265 citations were identified and, of these, 27 articles describing 32 cases of autoresuscitation were included (n = 32; age, 27-94 yrs). The studies came from 16 different countries and were considered of very-low quality (case reports or letters to the editor). All 32 cases reported autoresuscitation after failed cardiopulmonary resuscitation, with times ranging from a few seconds to 33 mins; however, continuity of observation and methods of monitoring were highly inconsistent. For the eight studies reporting continuous electrocardiogram monitoring and exact times, autoresuscitation did not occur beyond 7 mins after failed cardiopulmonary resuscitation. No cases of autoresuscitation in the absence of cardiopulmonary resuscitation were reported. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the provision of cardiopulmonary resuscitation may influence autoresuscitation. In the absence of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, as may apply to controlled organ donation after cardiac death after withdrawal of life-sustaining therapies, autoresuscitation has not been reported. The provision of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, as may apply to uncontrolled organ donation after cardiac death, may influence observation time. However, existing evidence is limited and is consequently insufficient to support or refute the recommended waiting period to determine death after a cardiac arrest, strongly supporting the need for prospective studies in dying patients.","Hornby, K; Hornby, L; Shemie, S D",Crit.

Reciprocity reconsidered: Gouldner's ‘moral norm of reciprocity’ and social support,"In a classic statement three decades ago, Gouldner (1960) made an important analytic distinction between reciprocity as a pattern of social exchange and reciprocity as a general moral belief. Gouldner argued that the moral norm of reciprocity constitutes an important 'causal force' in social life. The reciprocity norm dictates that Ego should not end up gaining at the expense of Alter's beneficial acts towards him or her. In contrast to equity theory, which suggests that people will react equally negatively to under- and overbenefiting, the reciprocity norm suggests that people will, above all, attempt to avoid overbenefiting from their socially supportive interactions. While many studies of social support have incorporated the concepts of reciprocity and exchange, virtually none has examined the validity of Gouldner's distinction nor its potential implications for the dynamics of social support. This paper explores the evidence for Gouldner's claims from studies on support and reciprocity. Evidence is found suggesting that people feel obligated to return benefits they receive from others, appear to be more psychologically and emotionally averse to overbenefiting than underbenefiting from social support interactions, and tend to avoid placing themselves in the position of 'overbenefitors'. Alternative explanations for avoidance of overbenefiting are considered, and implications for the study of social support are explored. © 1995, Sage Publications.

"Causal theories, models and evidence in economics—some reflections from the natural sciences","Models have been extensively analysed in economic methodology, notably their degree of ability to provide explanations. This paper takes a complementary, comparative approach, examining theory development in the natural sciences. Examples show how diverse types of evidence combine with causal hypotheses to generate empirically based causal theories—a cumulative process occurring over a long timescale. Models are typically nested within this broader theory. This could be a good model for research in economics, providing a methodology that ensures good correspondence with the target system—especially as economics research is largely empirical, and has effective methods for causal inference. This paper analyses the key features of three successful theories in the natural sciences, and draws out some lessons that may be useful to economists. Some examples of good practice in economics are noted, e.g. involving money and banking, and the growth of the state. On the other hand, the widespread pre-crisis use of dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models that ignored the financial sector raises the question, how to realise what has been omitted?

The bystander-effect: a meta-analytic review on bystander intervention in dangerous and non-dangerous emergencies,"Research on bystander intervention has produced a great number of studies showing that the presence of other people in a critical situation reduces the likelihood that an individual will help. As the last systematic review of bystander research was published in 1981 and was not a quantitative meta-analysis in the modern sense, the present meta-analysis updates the knowledge about the bystander effect and its potential moderators. The present work (a) integrates the bystander literature from the 1960s to 2010, (b) provides statistical tests of potential moderators, and (c) presents new theoretical and empirical perspectives on the novel finding of non-negative bystander effects in certain dangerous emergencies as well as situations where bystanders are a source of physical support for the potentially intervening individual. In a fixed effects model, data from over 7,700 participants and 105 independent effect sizes revealed an overall effect size of g = -0.35. The bystander effect was attenuated when situations were perceived as dangerous (compared with non-dangerous), perpetrators were present (compared with non-present), and the costs of intervention were physical (compared with non-physical). This pattern of findings is consistent with the arousal-cost-reward model, which proposes that dangerous emergencies are recognized faster and more clearly as real emergencies, thereby inducing higher levels of arousal and hence more helping. We also identified situations where bystanders provide welcome physical support for the potentially intervening individual and thus reduce the bystander effect, such as when the bystanders were exclusively male, when they were naive rather than passive confederates or only virtually present persons, and when the bystanders were not strangers.","Fischer, Peter; Krueger, Joachim I; Greitemeyer, Tobias; Vogrincic, Claudia; Kastenmüller, Andreas; Frey, Dieter; Heene, Moritz; Wicher, Magdalena; Kainbacher, Martina",Psychol.

Sleep restriction and circadian effects on social decisions,"Our study examines how chronic sleep restriction and suboptimal times-of-day affect decisions in a classic set of social tasks. We experimentally manipulate and objectively measured sleep in 184 young-adult subjects, who were also randomly assigned an early morning or late evening experiment session during which decision tasks were administered. Sleep restriction and suboptimal time-of-day are both estimated to either directly or indirectly (via an impact on sleepiness) reduce altruism, trust, and trustworthiness. We conclude that commonly experienced adverse sleep states, most notably chronic sleep restriction, significantly reduce prosocial behaviors, and can therefore limit benefits from short-term social interactions. © 2017","Dickinson, D.L.; McElroy, T.",Eur.

The Contingent Value of Political Connections on Donations to Chinese Foundations: Exploring the Moderating Role of Transparency,"Existing studies assume that the value of political connections is homogeneous to different types of nonprofits and seldom consider their interplay with other accountability mechanisms. Based on a multilevel analysis of 2,085 foundations in China, this study builds and tests a theoretical framework of the contingent value of political connections to nonprofits, treating transparency as a moderator for the relationship between political connections and donations. Our findings suggest that while transparency is positively associated with the amount of donations obtained by foundations, political connections can help foundations obtain more donations only when their transparency score is higher than a certain threshold. © The Author(s) 2020.","Cheng, Y.; Wu, Z.",Adm.

Inconsistencies in repeated refugee status decisions,"Consistency in civil servant decisions is paramount to upholding judicial equality for citizens and individuals seeking safety through governmental intervention. We investigated refugee status decisions made by a sample of civil servants at the Swedish Migration Agency. We hypothesized, based on the emotional demands such decisions bring with them, that participants would exhibit a compassion fade effect such that refugee status was less likely to be granted over time. To test this, we administered a questionnaire containing brief presentations of asylum seekers and asked participants to judge how likely they would be to give refugee status to the person. Crucially the first, middle, and final case presented were matched on decision relevant characteristics. Consistent with our hypothesis, we saw a significant decline in ratings. These effects were accentuated by the amount of time a participant had worked at the agency, consistent with depletion of affective resources, and attenuated in workers with greater responsibility and additional training. We conclude that active regulation of empathic and affective responses to asylum seekers may play a role in determining the outcome in refugee status decisions. © 2020 The Authors.

"Mental imagery, impact, and affect: A mediation model for charitable giving","One of the puzzling phenomena in philanthropy is that people can show strong compassion for identified individual victims but remain unmoved by catastrophes that affect large numbers of victims. Two prominent findings in research on charitable giving reflect this idiosyncrasy: The (1) identified victim and (2) victim number effects. The first of these suggests that identifying victims increases donations and the second refers to the finding that people's willingness to donate often decreases as the number of victims increases. While these effects have been documented in the literature, their underlying psychological processes need further study.We propose a model in which identified victim and victim number effects operate through different cognitive and affective mechanisms. In two experiments we present empirical evidence for such a model and show that different affective motivations (donor-focused vs. victim-focused feelings) are related to the cognitive processes of impact judgments and mental imagery. Moreover, we argue that different mediation pathways exist for identifiability and victim number effects. © 2016 Dickert et al.

Laws and other formal rules are 'obligations backed by incentives'. In this paper we explore how formal rules affect cooperative behavior. Our analysis is based on a series of experimental public good games designed to isolate the impact of exogenously requested minimum contributions (obligations) from those of the marginal incentives backing them. We find that obligations have a sizeable effect on cooperative behavior even in the absence of incentives. When non-binding incentives are introduced, requested contributions strongly sustain cooperation. Therefore, in contrast with cases in which incentives crowd-out cooperative behavior, in our experiments obligations and incentives are complementary, jointly supporting high levels of contributions. Moreover, we find that variations in obligations affect behavior even when incentives are held constant. Finally, we explore the behavioral channels of the previous results, finding that people's beliefs about others' contributions and the willingness to cooperate are both called into play. © 2014.","Galbiati, R.; Vertova, P.",Int.

Escaping Affect: How Motivated Emotion Regulation Creates Insensitivity to Mass Suffering,"As the number of people in need of help increases, the degree of compassion people feel for them ironically tends to decrease. This phenomenon is termed the collapse of compassion. Some researchers have suggested that this effect happens because emotions are not triggered by aggregates. We provide evidence for an alternative account. People expect the needs of large groups to be potentially overwhelming, and, as a result, they engage in emotion regulation to prevent themselves from experiencing overwhelming levels of emotion. Because groups are more likely than individuals to elicit emotion regulation, people feel less for groups than for individuals. In Experiment 1, participants displayed the collapse of compassion only when they expected to be asked to donate money to the victims. This suggests that the effect is motivated by self-interest. Experiment 2 showed that the collapse of compassion emerged only for people who were skilled at emotion regulation. In Experiment 3, we manipulated emotion regulation. Participants who were told to down-regulate their emotions showed the collapse of compassion, but participants who were told to experience their emotions did not. We examined the time course of these effects using a dynamic rating to measure affective responses in real time. The time course data suggested that participants regulate emotion toward groups proactively, by preventing themselves from ever experiencing as much emotion toward groups as toward individuals. These findings provide initial evidence that motivated emotion regulation drives insensitivity to mass suffering. © 2011 American Psychological Association.","Cameron, C.D.; Payne, B.K.",J. Pers.

Is Empathy the Default Response to Suffering? A Meta-Analytic Evaluation of Perspective Taking’s Effect on Empathic Concern,"We conducted a series of meta-analytic tests on experiments in which participants read perspective-taking instructions—that is, written instructions to imagine a distressed persons’ point of view (“imagine-self” and “imagine-other” instructions), or to inhibit such actions (“remain-objective” instructions)—and afterwards reported how much empathic concern they experienced upon learning about the distressed person. If people spontaneously empathize with others, then participants who receive remain-objective instructions should report less empathic concern than do participants in a “no-instructions” control condition; if people can deliberately increase how much empathic concern they experience, then imagine-self and imagine-other instructions should increase empathic concern relative to not receiving any instructions. Random-effects models revealed that remain-objective instructions reduced empathic concern, but “imagine” instructions did not significantly increase it. The results were robust to most corrections for bias. Our conclusions were not qualified by the study characteristics we examined, but most relevant moderators have not yet been thoroughly studied. © 2019 by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc.","McAuliffe, W.H.B.; Carter, E.C.; Berhane, J.; Snihur, A.C.; McCullough, M.E.",Pers.

"Giving once, giving twice: A two-period field experiment on intertemporal crowding in charitable giving","We study intertemporal crowding between two fundraising campaigns for the same charitable organization by manipulating donors’ beliefs about the likelihood of future campaigns in two subsequent field experiments. The data shows that initial giving is decreasing in the likelihood of a future campaign while subsequent giving increases in initial giving. While this refutes the predictions of a simple expected utility model, the pattern is in line with a model that allows for (anticipated or unanticipated) habit formation provided that donations in the two periods are substitutes. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Adena, M.; Huck, S.",J.

Procedural fairness and nepotism among local traditional and democratic leaders in rural Namibia,"This study tests the common conception that democratically elected leaders behave in the interest of their constituents more than traditional chiefs do. Our sample includes 64 village leaders and 384 villagers in rural Namibia, where democratically elected leaders and traditional chiefs coexist. We analyze two main attributes of local political leaders: procedural fairness preferences and preferential treatment of relatives (nepotism). We also measure personality traits and social preferences, and conduct standardized surveys on local governance practices and villagers' perceptions of their leaders' performance. Our results indicate that traditional chiefs are as likely to implement fair, democratic decision-making procedures, and are as unlikely to be nepotistic. Moreover, elected leaders and chiefs express similar social preferences and personality traits. These findings align with villagers' perceptions of most leaders in our sample as being popular and fair, and villagers' responses reveal a discrepancy between planned and de facto implementation of democratic institutions.

"Too smart to be selfish? Measures of cognitive ability, social preferences, and consistency","Although there is an increasing interest in examining the relationship between cognitive ability and economic behavior, less is known about the relationship between cognitive ability and social preferences. We investigate the relationship between consequential measures of cognitive ability and measures of social preferences. We have data on a series of small-stakes dictator-type decisions, known as Social Value Orientation (SVO), in addition to choices in a larger-stakes dictator game. We also have access to the grade point averages (GPA) and SAT (formerly referred to as the Scholastic Aptitude Test) outcomes of our subjects. We find that subjects who perform better on the Math portion of the SAT are more generous in both the dictator game and the SVO measure. By contrast we find that subjects with a higher GPA are more selfish in the dictator game and more generous according to the SVO. We also find some evidence that the subjects with higher GPA and higher SAT outcomes offer more consistent responses. Our results involving GPA and social preferences complement previous work which employ measures of cognitive ability which are sensitive to the intrinsic motivation of the subject. Our results involving SAT scores are without precedent in the literature and suggest that measures of cognitive ability, which are less sensitive to the intrinsic motivation of the subject, are positively related to generosity. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Chen, C.-C.; Chiu, I.-M.; Smith, J.; Yamada, T.",J.

Times to key events in Zika virus infection and implications for blood donation: a systematic review,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the timing of key events in the natural history of Zika virus infection. METHODS: In February 2016, we searched PubMed, Scopus and the Web of Science for publications containing the term Zika. By pooling data, we estimated the incubation period, the time to seroconversion and the duration of viral shedding. We estimated the risk of Zika virus contaminated blood donations. FINDINGS: We identified 20 articles on 25 patients with Zika virus infection. The median incubation period for the infection was estimated to be 5.9 days (95% credible interval, CrI: 4.4-7.6), with 95% of people who developed symptoms doing so within 11.2 days (95% CrI: 7.6-18.0) after infection. On average, seroconversion occurred 9.1 days (95% CrI: 7.0-11.6) after infection. The virus was detectable in blood for 9.9 days (95% CrI: 6.9-21.4) on average. Without screening, the estimated risk that a blood donation would come from an infected individual increased by approximately 1 in 10 000 for every 1 per 100 000 person-days increase in the incidence of Zika virus infection. Symptom-based screening may reduce this rate by 7% (relative risk, RR: 0.93; 95% CrI: 0.89-0.99) and antibody screening, by 29% (RR: 0.71; 95% CrI: 0.28-0.88). CONCLUSION: Neither symptom- nor antibody-based screening for Zika virus infection substantially reduced the risk that blood donations would be contaminated by the virus. Polymerase chain reaction testing should be considered for identifying blood safe for use in pregnant women in high-incidence areas.","Lessler, Justin; Ott, Cassandra T; Carcelen, Andrea C; Konikoff, Jacob M; Williamson, Joe; Bi, Qifang; Kucirka, Lauren M; Cummings, Derek At; Reich, Nicholas G; Chaisson, Lelia H",Bull.

"Publication Bias in Meta-Analysis: Prevention, Assessment and Adjustments","Publication bias is the tendency to decide to publish a study based on the results of the study, rather than on the basis of its theoretical or methodological quality. It can arise from selective publication of favorable results, or of statistically significant results. This threatens the validity of conclusions drawn from reviews of published scientific research. Meta-analysis is now used in numerous scientific disciplines, summarizing quantitative evidence from multiple studies. If the literature being synthesised has been affected by publication bias, this in turn biases the meta-analytic results, potentially producing overstated conclusions. Publication Bias in Meta-Analysis examines the different types of publication bias, and presents the methods for estimating and reducing publication bias, or eliminating it altogether. Written by leading experts, adopting a practical and multidisciplinary approach. Provides comprehensive coverage of the topic including: • Different types of publication bias, • Mechanisms that may induce them, • Empirical evidence for their existence, • Statistical methods to address them, • Ways in which they can be avoided. • Features worked examples and common data sets throughout. • Explains and compares all available software used for analysing and reducing publication bias. • Accompanied by a website featuring software, data sets and further material.

Cooperation and decision time,"We review two fundamentally different ways that decision time is related to cooperation. First, studies have experimentally manipulated decision time to understand how cooperation is related to the use of intuition versus deliberation. Current evidence supports the claim that time pressure (and, more generally, intuition) favors cooperation. Second, correlational studies reveal that self-paced decision times are primarily related to decision conflict, not the use of intuition or deliberation. As a result, extreme cooperation decisions occur more quickly than intermediate decisions, and the relative speed of highly cooperative versus non-cooperative decisions depends on details of the design and participant pool. Finally, we discuss interpersonal consequences of decision time: people are judged based on how quickly they cooperate, and decision time is used as a cue to predict cooperation. © 2018","Evans, A.M.; Rand, D.G.",Curr.

Donors to charity gain in both indirect reciprocity and political reputation,"Darwinian evolution can explain human cooperative behaviour among non-kin by either direct or indirect reciprocity. In the latter case one does not expect a return for an altruistic act from the recipient as with direct reciprocity, but from another member of the social group. However, the widespread human behaviour of donating to poor people outside the social group, for example, to charity organizations, that are unlikely to reciprocate indirectly and thus are equivalent to defectors in the game is still an evolutionary puzzle. Here we show experimentally that donations made in public to a well-known relief organization resulted both in increased income (that the donors received from the members of their group) and in enhanced political reputation (they were elected to represent the interests of their group). Donations may thus function as an honest signal for one's social reliability.","Milinski, M.; Semmann, D.; Krambeck, H.-J.",Proc. R. Soc. B Biol. Sci.,2245

"Masculinity, femininity, and leadership: Taking a closer look at the alpha female","An extensive review and textual analysis of the academic and popular literature of the human alpha female was conducted to examine the social construction and expression of the alpha female identity in a small non-random sample of North American women (N = 398). This review revealed 2 predominant alpha female representations in the literature–one more masculine versus one more feminine–and 21 alpha female variables. In this sample of women, the “alpha female” was found to be a recognized socially constructed female identity. Univariate analysis revealed positive and highly significant differences in self-reported mean scores between alpha (N = 94) and non-alpha (N = 304) females for 10 variables including, masculine traits, leadership, strength, low introversion, self-esteem, life satisfaction, sexual experience, initiates sex, enjoys sex and playing a dominant role in sexual encounters, with alpha females scoring higher than non-alphas. The measure of masculine traits was identified as the only predictor of alpha female status as per the multiple regression model. Interestingly, both alpha and non-alpha women scored the same for the measure of feminine traits. Further, both groups scored higher for feminine traits than masculine traits. The results also revealed that neither social dominance nor sexual dominance were predictors of alpha female status which challenge academic and popularized representations of this identity. The results suggest that although the alpha female is often regarded as an exceptional and, at times, an exoticized form of femininity, like other femininities, her identity is marked by contradictions and tensions © 2019 Monika K.

"An update on the efficacy of cognitive-behavioral therapy, cognitive therapy, and exposure therapy for posttraumatic stress disorder","OBJECTIVE: Even though cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is the current treatment of choice for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), it is still unclear which components of its protocol are more important for clinical improvement. This study aims to replicate a previous review, updating findings on the efficacy of CBT, cognitive therapy (CT), and exposure therapy (ET) for PTSD when compared with other well-established treatments or conditions without active treatment. METHOD: The search was performed in the databases Cochrane, Embase, and Medline. Studies were required to be randomized controlled trials published between 2006 and 2012 comparing CBT, CT, or ET with (1) each other, (2) other active treatments (e.g., EMDR, counseling, supportive therapy), or (3) assessment-only conditions. The main outcome measures were diagnostic and symptomatic remission. RESULTS: The final sample contained 29 articles. CBT, CT, and ET were shown to be efficacious treatments individually when compared to assessment-only conditions, with no difference found between treatments. Comparison with other active treatments favored ET. Both included studies comparing CBT and EMDR favored the latter. CONCLUSIONS: CBT and its components still appear to be equally efficacious in improving PTSD symptoms and diagnosis. Even so, a current tendency of researchers to focus on ET exists. EMDR shows interesting results compared to CBT. Further research should clarify the lasting effects, efficiency, and other comparative benefits of each protocol.","Mello, Patricia Gaspar; Silva, Gustavo Ramos; Donat, Julia Candia; Kristensen, Christian Haag",Int.

Influence of self-reported distress and empathy on egoistic versus altruistic motivation to help,"Proposed that a distinction be made between 2 emotional responses to seeing another person suffer--personal distress and empathy--and that these 2 emotions lead to 2 different kinds of motivation to help: Personal distress leads to egoistic motivation; empathy, to altruistic motivation. These distinctions were tested in 3 studies, each using 10 male and 10 female undergraduates. Across the 3 studies, factor analysis of Ss' self-reported emotional response indicated that feelings of personal distress and empathy, although positively correlated, were experienced as qualitatively distinct. The pattern of helping in Studies 1 and 2 indicated that a predominance of personal distress led to egoistic motivation, whereas a predominance of empathy led to altruistic motivation. In Study 3, the cost of helping was made especially high. Results suggest an important qualification on the link between empathic emotion and altruistic motivation: Ss reporting a predominance of empathy displayed an egoistic pattern of helping. Apparently, making helping costly evoked self-concern, which overrode any altruistic impulse produced by feeling empathy.

Does implicit bias predict dictator giving?,"Implicit associations and biases are carried without awareness or conscious direction, yet there is reason to believe they may be influenced by social pressures. In this paper, I study social pressure as a motive to give, as well as giving itself under conditions of implicit bias. In doing so, I pair the Implicit Association Test (IAT), commonplace in other social sciences, with a laboratory dictator game with sorting. I find that despite its popularity, the IAT does not predict dictator giving and social pressure does not explain acts of giving from biased dictators. These results are indicative of the meaningful difference between having an implicit bias and acting on one. As such, results can be thought of as a bound on the external validity of the IAT. © 2018 by the author. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Lee, D.J.",Games,2251
Deliberation favours social efficiency by making people disregard their relative shares: Evidence from USA and India,"Groups make decisions on both the production and the distribution of resources. These decisions typically involve a tension between increasing the total level of group resources (i.e. social efficiency) and distributing these resources among group members (i.e. individuals’ relative shares). This is the case because the redistribution process may destroy part of the resources, thus resulting in socially inefficient allocations. Here we apply a dual-process approach to understand the cognitive underpinnings of this fundamental tension. We conducted a set of experiments to examine the extent to which different allocation decisions respond to intuition or deliberation. In a newly developed approach, we assess intuition and deliberation at both the trait level (using the Cognitive Reflection Test, henceforth CRT) and the state level (through the experimental manipulation of response times). To test for robustness, experiments were conducted in two countries: the USA and India. Despite absolute-level differences across countries, in both locations we show that: (i) time pressure and low CRT scores are associated with individuals’ concerns for their relative shares and (ii) time delay and high CRT scores are associated with individuals’ concerns for social efficiency. These findings demonstrate that deliberation favours social efficiency by overriding individuals’ intuitive tendency to focus on relative shares. © 2017 The Authors.","Capraro, V.; Corgnet, B.; Espín, A.M.; Hernán-González, R.",R.

Lean services: a systematic review,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to highlight the importance of Lean methodology through an exhaustive literature review, and its implications and application in the service industry right from its initiation in 1990s till date. Design/methodology/approach: The paper summarises the evolution of Lean in services and has systematically classified the reviewed literature in four dimensions, namely time, publisher, region and content. Further under “time” dimension, the literature is classified into Pre-Lean era, Lean awareness era, Lean Exploration era and Lean implementation era. Under the “content” dimension, the categories include theoretical foundation, frameworks/models and application/case studies. Findings: The analysis inferred; Lean is gaining roads in services, though the research is still at nascent stage. Lean is applicable in services though transfer of Lean manufacturing principles to services has certain limitations because of the characteristics of services. The need is to focus on process difference between services and manufacturing. Respect for people and employment engagement is critical to Lean in service. The authors identified the necessity to standardise the Lean service definition, principles, and tools and to develop guidelines for structured implementation in service industry. Research limitations/implications: Though multiple databases have been taken-up but that does not assume that the literature presented in this paper is by any means comprehensive. Development of a standard model/framework for Lean services is critical for future research. Rigorous industry-specific studies, specifically in developing nations are another area for future research. Future studies could analyse the impact of join applications and possible links between Lean service and other approaches like TQM, Six Sigma, etc., with an aim of process improvement. Practical implications: This paper would serve as a resource for Lean practitioners as well as researchers as a fundamental platform, contributing to Lean body of knowledge. Social implications: Service industry has special significance to the society in large. Many services including governments, public interest services, non-profit organisations, healthcare, banking, consulting, etc., has a significant share across markets. Lean being a proven methodology for successful process improvements has to be looked at from a services perspective. This paper helps in such interest. Originality/value: Publications reviewing the adoption of Lean in services is scarce in literature. This paper serves as an excellent resource for research on the subject and will facilitate academicians and practitioners to objectively understand Lean in service sector. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Gupta, Shradha; Sharma, Monica; Sunder M., Vijaya",International Journal of Productivity and Performance Management,2253
Can empathic concern be generalized from one person to others? Another positive side of the ‘one-among-others’ effect,"Previous research on the one-among-others effect has shown that inducing empathic concern towards a victim presented among other individuals in need enhances: (1) awareness of these others and (2) the willingness to help them individually. In this work, we test that these outcomes are linked by an additional process: the generalization of empathic concern felt for the victim towards the others in need. Study 1 revealed that inducing empathic concern for a victim presented as one-among-others led to see the others as separate and different individuals, not as a unitary group. Study 2 showed that the one-among-others presentation (vs. only-one-victim) increased empathic concern towards those presented along with the main victim. Study 3 showed that the one-among-others presentation (vs. a single-victim or a statistical presentation) increased the empathic concern felt for other individuals in need. Therefore, the one-among-others presentation does not weaken empathic concern but, instead, it leads to its generalization from one to others. © 2016 Scandinavian Psychological Associations and John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Ambrona, T.; Oceja, L.; López-Pérez, B.; Carrera, P.",Scand.

Exposure to fictional medical television and health: a systematic review,"Fictional medical television programs have long been a staple of television programming, and they remain popular today. We aimed to examine published literature assessing the influence of medical television programs on health outcomes. We conducted systematic literature searches in PubMed, PsychINFO and CINAHL. Selected studies had to be scholarly research, to involve exposure to fictionalized medical television programming, and to assess associations between exposures and outcomes. Of 3541 unique studies identified, nineteen met selection criteria. The most commonly studied programs were ER (73%), Grey's Anatomy (58%) and House M.D. (37%). Outcomes included knowledge, perceptions and behaviors related to topics as diverse as organ donation, cancer screening, sexually transmitted infections, and heart disease. Viewing fictional medical television programs had a negative influence on viewers' health-related knowledge, perceptions and/or behavior in 11% of studies, a positive influence in 32% of studies, and mixed influence in 58%. While most studies (58%) were characterized as having fair quality in terms of rigor of study design, 21% were classified as good and 21% were classified as poor. As such, medical television can affect health education and outcomes. Future work should utilize randomization, more longitudinal assessments, and more direct assessments of health education and behavioral outcomes.","Hoffman, Beth L; Shensa, Ariel; Wessel, Charles; Hoffman, Robert; Primack, Brian A",Health Educ.

"Sex, violence, & rock n' roll: Longitudinal effects of music on aggression, sex, and prosocial behavior during adolescence","The current study examined longitudinal associations between listening to aggression, sex, and prosocial behavior in music on a number of behavioral outcomes across a one-year period during adolescence. Adolescents (N=548, M age=15.32, 52% female) completed a number of questionnaires on musical preferences, general media use, aggression, sexual outcomes, and prosocial behavior at two different time points separated by about one year. Using structural equation modeling to analyze the data, results revealed that listening to aggression in music was associated with increased aggression and decreased prosocial behavior over time, even when controlling for initial levels of these behaviors. Listening to sexual content in music was associated with earlier initiation of sexual intercourse and a trend for a higher number of sexual partners (reported at Time 2). Prosocial behavior in music was not associated with any behavioral outcome longitudinally. Collectively, these results suggest that listening to certain types of content in music can have a longitudinal effect on behavior during adolescence. © 2015 The Foundation for Professionals in Services for Adolescents.","Coyne, S.M.; Padilla-Walker, L.M.",J.

Preoperative Autologous Donation Decreases Allogeneic Transfusion but Increases Exposure to All Red Blood Cell Transfusion: Results of a Meta-analysis,"BackgroundConcern about risks associated with allogeneic red blood cell transfusion has led to interest in methods of decreasing patient exposure to perioperative transfusion.ObjectiveTo perform a meta-analysis to determine the degree to which predonation of autologous blood reduces patients' exposure to allogeneic blood and all transfusions of red blood cells (allogeneic or autologous).MethodsWe searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, bibliographies, annual reports, press releases, newsletters from organizations with interests in the blood system, and personal files for randomized studies and concurrent control cohort studies in which the control groups were patients excluded for nonmedical reasons.ResultsPatients who predonated autologous blood were less likely to receive allogeneic blood in the 6 randomized studies (n=933) (odds ratio [OR], 0.17; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.08-0.32) and in the 9 cohort studies (n=2351) (OR, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.14-0.26). However, autologous donors were more likely to undergo transfusion with allogeneic and/or autologous blood (for randomized studies: OR, 3.03; 95% CI, 1.70-5.39 and for cohort studies: OR, 12.32; 95% CI, 5.90-25.40). Studies that reported use of transfusion protocols found less benefit with preoperative autologous donation, although the difference was not statistically significant.ConclusionsPreoperative autologous donation of blood decreases exposure to allogeneic blood but increases exposure to any transfusion (allogeneic and/or autologous). There is a direct relationship between the transfusion rate in the control group and the benefit derived from preoperative autologous donation. This suggests that other methods of decreasing blood transfusion, such as surgical technique and transfusion protocols, may be as important as preoperative autologous donation of blood.","Forgie, Melissa A; Wells, Philip S; Laupacis, Andreas; Fergusson, Dean",Arch.

The influence of rewards on (sub-)optimal interleaving,"We investigate how the rewards of individual tasks dictate a priori how easy it is to interleave two discrete tasks efficiently, and whether people then interleave efficiently. Previous research found that people vary in their ability to interleave efficiently. Less attention has been given to whether it was realistic to expect efficient interleaving, given the reward rate of each of the involved tasks. Using a simulation model, we demonstrate how the rewards of individual tasks lead to different dual-task interleaving scenarios. We identify three unique dual-task scenarios. In easy scenarios, many strategies for time division between tasks can achieve optimal performance. This gives great opportunity to optimize performance, but also leads to variation in the applied strategies due to a lack of pressure to settle on a small set of optimal strategies. In difficult scenarios, the optimal strategy is hard to identify, therefore giving little opportunity to optimize. Finally, constrained scenarios have a well-defined prediction of the optimal strategy. It gives a narrow prediction, which limits the options to achieve optimal scores, yet given the structure people are able to optimize their strategies. These scenarios are therefore best to test people’s general capability of optimizing interleaving. We report three empirical studies that test these hypotheses. In each study, participants interleave between two identical discrete tasks, that differ only in the underlying reward functions and the combined result (easy, difficult, or constrained scenario). Empirical results match the theoretical pattern as predicted by simulation models. Implications for theory and practice are discussed. © 2019 Janssen et al.

"Reward, punishment, and cooperation: a meta-analysis","How effective are rewards (for cooperation) and punishment (for noncooperation) as tools to promote cooperation in social dilemmas or situations when immediate self-interest and longer term collective interest conflict? What variables can promote the impact of these incentives? Although such questions have been examined, social and behavioral scientists provide different answers. To date, there is no theoretical and/or quantitative review of rewards and punishments as incentives for cooperation in social dilemmas. Using a novel interdependence-theoretic framework, we propose that rewards and punishments should both promote cooperation, and we identify 2 variables—cost of incentives and source of incentives—that are predicted to magnify the effectiveness of these incentives in promoting cooperation.A meta-analysis involving 187 effect sizes revealed that rewards and punishments exhibited a statistically equivalent positive effect on cooperation (d =0.51 and 0.70, respectively). The effectiveness of incentives was stronger when the incentives were costly to administer, compared to free. Centralization of incentives did not moderate the effect size. Punishments were also more effective during iterated dilemmas when participants continued to interact in the same group, compared to both (a) iterated dilemmas with reassignment to a new group after each trial and (b) one-shot dilemmas. We also examine several other potential moderators, such as iterations, partner matching, group size, country, and participant payment. We discuss broad conclusions, consider implications for theory, and suggest directions for future research on rewards and punishment in social dilemmas.","Balliet, Daniel; Mulder, Laetitia B; Van Lange, Paul A M",Psychol.

Tournament group identity and performance: The moderating effect of winner proportion,"Tournament incentives are common in organizations, and how characteristics of the tournament group (e.g., tournament group identity) and the tournament incentives (e.g., winner proportion) affect tournament performance are of both practical and theoretical importance. We conduct two experiments in which participants compete for tournament rewards against others in their group. In both experiments, we manipulate the strength of participants' identity with their fellow group members and whether the tournament has a small winner proportion with a single reward or a large winner proportion with multiple rewards. In Experiment 1, we find increasing tournament group identity leads to higher other-regarding preference. We also find other-regarding preference decreases competitiveness more in a large winner proportion tournament compared to a small winner proportion tournament. In Experiment 2, we find increasing tournament group identity decreases performance in a real-effort task under a large winner proportion tournament, but it has no effect on performance under a small winner proportion tournament. Together, the two experiments suggest that increasing tournament group identity increases other-regarding preference, and other-regarding preference has a larger negative impact on competitiveness and hence, tournament performance when the winner proportion is large than when it is small. Our results highlight for managers the importance of considering group identity when determining tournament winner proportions. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Kelly, K.; Presslee, A.",Account. Organ.

The effect of moral intensity on ethical judgment,"Following an extensive review of the moral intensity literature, this article reports the findings of two studies (one between-subjects, the other within-subject) that examined the effect of manipulated and perceived moral intensity on ethical judgment. In the between-subjects study participants judged actions taken in manipulated high moral intensity scenarios to be more unethical than the same actions taken in manipulated low moral intensity scenarios. Findings were mixed for the effect of perceived moral intensity. Both probable magnitude of consequences (a factor consisting of magnitude of consequences, probability of effect, and temporal immediacy) and social consensus had a significant effect; proximity did not. In the within-subject study manipulated moral intensity had a significant effect on ethical judgment, but perceived moral intensity did not. Regression of ethical judgment on age, gender, major, and the three perceived moral intensity factors was significant between-subjects, but not within-subject. Ethical judgment was found to be a more robust predictor of intention than perceived moral intensity using a within-subject design. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2007.","McMahon, J.M.; Harvey, R.J.",J.

Gender differences in yielding to social influence: An impunity experiment,"In impunity games proposers, like allocators in dictator games, can take what they want; however, responders can refuse offers deemed unsatisfactory at own cost. We modify the impunity game via allowing offers to condition of another participant’s counterfactual generosity intention. For a given pair of proposer candidates each states, via the strategy vector method, an intended and two adjusted offers: one (possibly) upward adjusted in case the intended offer of the other candidate is higher and one (possibly) downward adjusted in case it is lower. Additionally, each candidate determines an acceptance threshold for the responder role. Only one candidate in each pair is randomly selected and endowed as the actual proposer whose offer is either possibly upward or downward adjusted depending on the counterfactual offer of the other proposer candidate. The endowed proposer of one pair is matched with the non-endowed candidate of another pair in the responder role. The data confirm that counterfactual intentions of others often affect own generosity via substantial and significant average adjustments to the weakest social influence. Overall, offers seem correlated with acceptance thresholds. Furthermore, we find significant gender differences: female participants state lower intended and adjusted offers as well as acceptance thresholds and therefore appear to be less sensitive to social influence. © 2018 by the authors.

The effects of recognition and group need on volunteerism: A social norm perspective,"The significance of volunteering for both individuals and society has lead to numerous studies on this behavior across the social sciences. However, virtually no prior research has evaluated how and to what extent organizations can effectively encourage individuals to contribute time to a worthy cause. The present research uses a social norm perspective to examine the conditions under which promotional appeals based on group need and promises of recognition affect volunteerism. The perspective suggests that norm compliance can be expected only when the prescribed behavior is both important to the group's welfare and subject to group-mediated rewards. Consequently, we hypothesize that promotional appeals based on group need and promised recognition are effective only when they are used in combination. Results of a laboratory and a field experiment are consistent with this hypothesis and provide insights into the process by which the appeals affect individuals' decisions to help. The results also have implications for understanding and promoting other socially desirable behaviors such as recycling, energy conservation, litter reduction, and the purchase of ""green"" products.","Fisher, R.J.; Ackerman, D.",J.

I've Got My Eyes on You: Implicit Social-Pressure Cues and Prosocial Behavior,"Explicit social pressure has been shown to be a powerful motivator of prosocial behavior-like voting in elections. In this study, I report the findings of a randomized field experiment designed to study the impact of more subtle, implicit social-pressure treatments. The results of the experiment, conducted in the October 2011 municipal elections in Key West, Florida, demonstrate that even subtle, implicit observability cues can effectively mobilize citizens to vote, perhaps as much as explicit surveillance cues. The findings speak more broadly to our understanding of human decision making, and even evolution, and provide fodder for the claim that humans are evolutionarily programmed to respond to certain stimuli. I interpret the evidence to support the notion that evolutionarily charged impulses, like exposure to images that implicitly signal the potential for surveillance and observability, are sufficient to overcome powerful collective action incentives to free ride. © 2013 International Society of Political Psychology.","Panagopoulos, C.",Polit.

"A systematic review of clinical trials of pharmacological interventions for acute ischaemic stroke (1955-2008) that were completed, but not published in full","BACKGROUND: We assessed the prevalence, and potential impact of, trials of pharmacological agents for acute stroke that were completed but not published in full. Failure to publish trial data is to be deprecated as it sets aside the altruism of participants' consent to be exposed to the risks of experimental interventions, potentially biases the assessment of the effects of therapies, and may lead to premature discontinuation of research into promising treatments. METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group's Specialised Register of Trials in June 2008 for completed trials of pharmacological interventions for acute ischaemic stroke, and searched MEDLINE and EMBASE (January 2007 - March 2009) for references to recent full publications. We assessed trial completion status from trial reports, online trials registers and correspondence with experts. RESULTS: We identified 940 trials. Of these, 125 (19.6%, 95% confidence interval 16.5-22.6) were completed but not published in full by the point prevalence date. They included 16,058 participants (16 trials had over 300 participants each) and tested 89 different interventions. Twenty-two trials with a total of 4,251 participants reported the number of deaths. In these trials, 636/4251 (15.0%) died. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that, at the point prevalence date, a substantial body of evidence that was of relevance both to clinical practice in acute stroke and future research in the field was not published in full. Over 16,000 patients had given informed consent and were exposed to the risks of therapy. Responsibility for non-publication lies with investigators, but pharmaceutical companies, research ethics committees, journals and governments can all encourage the timely publication of trial data.","Gibson, Lorna M; Brazzelli, Miriam; Thomas, Brenda M; Sandercock, Peter A G",Trials,2270
How should meta-regression analyses be undertaken and interpreted?,"Appropriate methods for meta-regression applied to a set of clinical trials, and the limitations and pitfalls in interpretation, are insufficiently recognized. Here we summarize recent research focusing on these issues, and consider three published examples of meta-regression in the light of this work. One principal methodological issue is that meta-regression should be weighted to take account of both within-trial variances of treatment effects and the residual between-trial heterogeneity (that is, heterogeneity not explained by the covariates in the regression). This corresponds to random effects meta-regression. The associations derived from meta-regressions are observational, and have a weaker interpretation than the causal relationships derived from randomized comparisons. This applies particularly when averages of patient characteristics in each trial are used as covariates in the regression. Data dredging is the main pitfall in reaching reliable conclusions from meta-regression. It can only be avoided by prespecification of covariates that will be investigated as potential sources of heterogeneity. However, in practice this is not always easy to achieve. The examples considered in this paper show the tension between the scientific rationale for using meta-regression and the difficult interpretative problems to which such analyses are prone.

Eyes on social norms: A field study on an honor system for newspaper sale,"Honor systems are a cheap and simple way for marketing low-price goods. These sale systems are dependent on the honesty of customers and can only tolerate a certain share of free-riders. In an experimental field study, we investigate a case where honesty has almost disappeared, namely an honor system for the sale of newspapers on weekends. In the chosen urban study area, only a minority of customers comply with payment norms. In this difficult setting, we tested the use of eye images and descriptive social norms as cues to improving payment morale over a period of 24 weeks. We find that interventions based on eye cues as well as normative appeals do not evoke a transition from low to high levels of honesty. However, our results suggest that such interventions might still have the potential to marginally increase mean payments and therefore be economically profitable for operators of large-scale honor systems. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Brudermann, T.; Bartel, G.; Fenzl, T.; Seebauer, S.",Theory Decis,2273

Stigma and compliance: A re-examination,"The study examined whether a female with a nonstigmatizing handicap would produce as much compliance to a request as a female with a stigmatizing handicap. In a field experiment, 60 male and 60 female Caucasian pedestrians were asked for money by a female confederate who appeared to have either a stigmatizing handicap, a nonstigmatizing handicap, or no handicap. A 3 × 2 analysis of variance examined the effects of Sex of Subject and Type of Handicap. A manipulation check was performed with a second group of pedestrians to determine the degree to which the two handicap conditions were perceived as permanent. There was no significant difference in the number of persons complying in the stigmatizing and nonstigmatizing handicap conditions. In addition, significantly more persons in the stigmatizing handicap condition (p <.01) and nonstigmatizing handicap conditions (p <.01) complied with the request than did persons in the no handicap condition. The manipulation check supported the conclusion that the stigmatizing handicap was perceived as relatively more permanent than the nonstigmatizing handicap. It was concluded that a handicap need not be stigmatizing in order to increase compliance. © 1977 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Levitt, L.; Kornhaber, R.C.",J. Soc. Psychol.,2275
On the duty to give (and not to take): An experiment on moralistic punishment,"Organizations aim to influence—via their internal guidelines and corporate culture—how unfair treatment of other stakeholders is perceived and condemned by employees. To understand how different frames and forms of publicity influence moralistic punishment, that is, the willingness of employees to take costs in order to foster norm compliance, we employ a modified version of a dictator game. In our dictator game, a bystander observes a dictator’s behavior towards a recipient and can punish the dictator. We vary how the dictator’s action is framed (either as giving money to the recipient or taking money from the recipient) and whether or not the recipient, as a victim of unfair behavior, is informed about the punishment. Our results suggest that bystanders are more likely to punish dictators when their action is framed as giving rather than taking, although both lead to the same consequences. When bystanders cannot inform recipients about their punishment, less punishment can be observed. On average, dictators partially anticipate this effect and behave more generously when recipients are informed about the bystanders’ punishment. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Rilke, R.M.",J.

Don’t Stare at Me: The Impact of a Humanoid Robot’s Gaze upon Trust During a Cooperative Human–Robot Visual Task,"Gaze is an important tool for social communication. Gaze can influence trust, likability, and compliance. However, excessive gaze in some contexts can signal threat, dominance and aggression, and hence complex social rules govern the appropriate use of gaze. Using a between-subjects design we investigated the impact of three levels of robot gaze (averted, constant and “situational”) upon participants’ likelihood of trusting a humanoid robot’s opinion in a cooperative visual tracking task. The robot, acting as a confederate, would disagree with participants’ responses on certain trials, and suggest a different answer. As constant, staring gaze between strangers is associated with dominance and threat, and averted gaze is associated with lying, we predicted participants would be most likely to be persuaded by a robot which only gazed during disagreements (“situational gaze”). However, gender effects were found, with females least likely to trust a robot which stared at them, and no significant differences between averted gaze and situational gaze.

Social facilitation: A meta-analysis of 241 studies,"Reports a meta-analysis of the effects of the presence of others on human task performance and physiology. In 241 studies involving nearly 24,000 Ss, the presence of others had small effects, accounting for .3% to 3% of the variance in the typical experiment. It is concluded that (a) the presence of others heightens an individual's physiological arousal only if the individual is performing a complex task; (b) the presence of others increases the speed of simple task performance and decreases the speed of complex task performance; (c) the presence of others impairs complex performance accuracy and slightly facilitates simple performance accuracy, although the facilitation is vulnerable to the ""file drawer problem"" of unreported null results; and (d) social facilitation effects are surprisingly unrelated to the performer's evaluation apprehension.

Altruistic behavior in cohesive social groups: The role of target identifiability,"People’s tendency to be more generous toward identifiable victims than toward unidentifiable or statistical victims is known as the Identifiable Victim Effect. Recent research has called the generality of this effect into question, showing that in cross-national contexts, identifiability mostly affects willingness to help victims of one’s own “in-group.” Furthermore, in inter-group conflict situations, identifiability increased generosity toward a member of the adversary group, but decreased generosity toward a member of one’s own group. In the present research we examine the role of group-cohesiveness as an underlying factor accounting for these divergent findings. In particular, we examined novel groups generated in the lab, using the minimal group paradigm, as well as natural groups of students in regular exercise sections. Allocation decisions in dictator games revealed that a group’s cohesiveness affects generosity toward in-group and out-group recipients differently, depending on their identifiability. In particular, in cohesive groups the identification of an in-group recipient decreased, rather than increased generosity. © 2017 Ritov, Kogut.

Does the government crowd-out private donations? New evidence from a sample of non-profit firms,"During the 1980s, government grants to non-profit organizations declined dramatically and the price of private donations increased. Given there are different costs associated with government grants and private donations to non-profits, it is important to study the relationship between these two sources and determine whether government grants 'crowd-out' private donations. I take a fresh look at the issue of crowd-out and improve upon the literature by exploiting a panel data set that links private donations to non-profit firms with the government grants they received. I study 430 non-profit shelter, human services, and other similar types of organizations that were in operation between 1982 and 1992. I find private donations to these non-profits effectively do not change with changes in government grants after controlling for firm heterogeneity and political and economic factors under an OLS specification. In a 2SLS specification, after controlling for possible endogeneity of the government grants the estimated crowd-out is significantly different from zero and one dollar; on average, the estimated crowd-out is ~50 cents.","Payne, A.A.",J.

This study examined associations between coplaying video games between siblings and levels of affection and conflict in the relationship.

Participants were recruited from a large Northwestern city and a moderate city in the Mountain West of the United States. Video games played between siblings were coded by an independent sample to assess levels of physical aggression and prosocial behavior in each game. Playing video games with a sibling was associated with higher levels of sibling affection for both boys and girls, but higher levels of conflict for boys only. Playing a violent video game with a brother was associated with lower levels of conflict in the sibling relationship, whereas playing a prosocial video game was not related to any sibling outcome. The value of video games in sibling relationships will be discussed, with a focus on the type of game and the sex of the adolescent. © 2015 The Foundation for Professionals in Services for Adolescents.","Coyne, S.M.; Jensen, A.C.; Smith, N.J.; Erickson, D.H.",J.

A Meta-Analytic Review of Corporate Social Responsibility and Corporate Financial Performance: The Moderating Effect of Contextual Factors,"The relationship between corporate social responsibility (CSR) and corporate financial performance (CFP) has long been a central and contentious debate in the literature. However, prior empirical studies provide indefinite conclusions. The purpose of this study is to review systematically and quantify the CSR?CFP link in a meta-analytic framework. Based on 119 effect sizes from 42 studies, this study estimates that the overall effect size of the CSR?CFP relationship is positive and significant, thus endorsing the argument that CSR does enhance financial performance. Furthermore, this work sheds light on the causal relationship between CSR and CFP. Subsequent financial performance is associated with prior social responsibility, while the reverse direction is not supported. This finding supports the instrumental stakeholder theory. As predicted, the meta-analysis results indicate that the measurement strategies of the two key constructs of CSR and CFP explain some variations of the CSR?CFP relationship. Last, this study examines the moderating effect of the environmental context on the CSR?CFP link. This work proposes that CSR in the developed world, with a relatively mature institutional system and efficient market mechanism, will be more visible than CSR in the developing world. The results show that the CSR?CFP relationship is stronger for firms from advanced economies than for firms from developing economies.","Wang, Qian; Dou, Junsheng; Jia, Shenghua",Business & Society,2289
Images of eyes enhance investments in a real-life public good,"A key issue in cooperation research is to determine the conditions under which individuals invest in a public good. Here, we tested whether cues of being watched increase investments in an anonymous public good situation in real life. We examined whether individuals would invest more by removing experimentally placed garbage (paper and plastic bottles) from bus stop benches in Geneva in the presence of images of eyes compared to controls (images of flowers). We provided separate bins for each of both types of garbage to investigate whether individuals would deposit more items into the appropriate bin in the presence of eyes. The treatment had no effect on the likelihood that individuals present at the bus stop would remove garbage. However, those individuals that engaged in garbage clearing, and were thus likely affected by the treatment, invested more time to do so in the presence of eyes. Images of eyes had a direct effect on behaviour, rather than merely enhancing attention towards a symbolic sign requesting removal of garbage. These findings show that simple images of eyes can trigger reputational effects that significantly enhance on non-monetary investments in anonymous public goods under real life conditions. We discuss our results in the light of previous findings and suggest that human social behaviour may often be shaped by relatively simple and potentially unconscious mechanisms instead of very complex cognitive capacities. © 2012 Francey, Bergmüller.","Francey, D.; Bergmüller, R.",PLoS ONE,2290

THE EFFECTS OF DIFFERENT MODES OF SUPERVISION ON VIGILANCE BEHAVIOUR,"Experiment I was run to determine if a closed‐circuit television and a one‐way window mode of supervision were as effective as the direct physical presence of an experimenter in inducing enhanced levels of signal detection in a Mackworth‐type vigilance task. A control condition of complete subject privacy was also examined. The results indicated that both the television and the window conditions had a positive effect on overall performance which was similar to that observed in the experimenter‐presence condition; however, the performance decrement over the 90 min. vigil was equivalent for the four modes. A second experiment involving the variable of camera position with an addition of a fourth 30 min. period yielded no significant differences between the camera positions, but overall performance in the television condition was again better than in the control condition. This study suggested that performance can be enhanced even without the physical presence of the experimenter. 1975 The British Psychological Society","PUTZ, V.R.",Br. J. Psychol.,2292
